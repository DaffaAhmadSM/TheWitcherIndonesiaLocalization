   1090000|00000000||What the…?!
   1090450|00000000||That was close.
   1090452|00000000||Something tells me that was no accident. Better investigate.
   1090682|00000000||Must be the place…
   1090684|00000000||You can come out. I've seen your plan.
   1093822|00000000||Besides, I can hear you.
   1092047|00000000||One of you's wheezing like a broken bellows.
   1092049|00000000||Another's panting frantically, like a deer caught in a trap.
   1092051|00000000||And the third should really take something for that throat. I'd try thyme extract.
   1092061|00000000||Any last words?
   1092063|00000000||Us? You're the prisoner.
   1092071|00000000||Sure about that?
   1092055|00000000||You're gonna regret what you've done.
   1092054|00000000||What's going on?
   1092057|00000000||Someone care to explain what's going on here?
   1092060|00000000||What's going on is that you're down there, and we're up here.
   1092069|00000000||That's a situation I can fix quickly.
   1092073|00000000||Witchy-thingy no gobgob. Or Poldy witchy-thingy sroop make.
   1092065|00000000||That's right! We've caught ye! Ye're at our mercy now - and we're none too merciful!
   1092075|00000000||Oh, really. Fact is, I could just turn around and--
   1092077|00000000||Poldy telled: witchy-thingy gobgob shut keep. Or sroop make.
   1092080|00000000||I wonder why he's not already in the "sroop."
   1092082|00000000||You were to kill him hrrrr…
   1092084|00000000||What?! We never said nothin' about killin'!
   1092086|00000000||Not a thing. We were just supposed to scare 'im.
   1092088|00000000||Show witchy-thingy us scary-thingys. Make him no touch us.
   1092111|00000000||I believe you misunderstood hrr…
   1092090|00000000||He's a murderer. Like the rest of them. Like the one who killed my Addalia hrrr hrrr hrrr…
   1093824|00000000||A doppler.
   1092092|00000000||Ahem. Awful sorry 'bout your wench - we all are. But this witcher didn't kill 'er. And we can't very well punish him for another's crime.
   1092094|00000000||He has much to answer for, too hrrr. I heard he killed a korred in Toussaint.
   1092096|00000000||But he spared a golden dragon!
   1092099|00000000||So what? What about Vereena, the bruxa with a fondness for blue roses from Nazair? He showed her no mercy hrrrr hrrrr…
   1092137|00000000||Salma, a succubus in Novigrad - let her go free. Even though I knew she'd killed some guardsmen.
   1093828|00000000||You mean… even when you know a monster's killed someone, you don't hurt them?
   1093830|00000000||If it had good reason - yeah, sometimes.
   1092183|00000000||I let Salma go.
   1092139|00000000||I spared the troll named Wham-a-wham, though I knew he'd killed some miners.
   1093832|00000000||Poldy know! Make yum-a-yum elfy sroop. And have yum-a-yum sis-sis…
   1092184|00000000||I spared Wham-a-wham's life.
   1092141|00000000||Some trolls live in a mountain pass near Kaer Morhen - know them? Poldy must, looks like their brother.
   1092143|00000000||Last time I was there, they were begging for a beating. My friend wanted to kill them. I talked him out of it.
   1092185|00000000||I spared the trolls living near Kaer Morhen.
   1092145|00000000||Not so long ago I spared the life of a doppler in Novigrad. He was stealing food for the Scoia'tael. Letting him go cost me a hefty bounty.
   1093834|00000000||Hm… I'm grateful. Not many of us left.
   1092186|00000000||I let a doppler go in Novigrad.
   1092147|00000000||There's this sylvan in Velen - you gotta know him. I had a choice - kill him and collect a reward from the local peasants, or talk it out with him. I chose the latter.
   1093836|00000000||Sylvans are nasty schemers. But it was nice of you to spare 'im.
   1092187|00000000||I made a deal with Fugas.
   1092123|00000000||I helped a godling. Two, in fact - Johnny and Sarah.
   1093844|00000000||That's true! I heard about that!
   1092125|00000000||Johnny, a godling living in Velen. Helped him recover his voice.
   1093840|00000000||That's right! A little birdie told me! Now Johnny can say all his favorite words, loud as he likes.
   1093842|00000000||The sound of "surreptitious shananacking" rings out over all Velen!
   1092206|00000000||Came across a godling in Novigrad recently. Sarah. I helped her.
   1093838|00000000||Ye helped Sarah?! I know her! She's always playing hilarious pranks.
   1092188|00000000||I helped a godling.
   1092101|00000000||Enough of this farce. You're all as good as dead.
   1092113|00000000||Won't show you any, either. Considered it for a moment there, but you made up my mind for me.
   1092115|00000000||Now come here. Alone or with that pack of yours. Let's end this.
   1092102|00000000||I say we go our separate ways before someone gets hurt.
   1092104|00000000||True, I killed Vereena. But you still got a chance, could still leave with your lives.
   1092106|00000000||Let's part in peace before someone gets hurt.
   1092108|00000000||Hrrr… Is that a threat?
   1094055|00000000||I'm trying to save your lives. Won't touch you as long as you don't attack. But one false move, and I'll have to defend myself.
   1093858|00000000||Gggggrrrrgggh! Get 'im!
   1093852|00000000||Uhh… just remembered - I left a cauldron on the fire!
   1093854|00000000||Any other cowards?!
   1094065|00000000||Poldy uncoward!
   1093856|00000000||Three against one - we might stand a chance.
   1092192|00000000||Errr, changed my mind. Not about to parley with monsters.
   1092194|00000000||Come here. Alone or with that pack of yours, doesn't matter. Let's end  this.
   1092196|00000000||Grrraarrhh, gladly.
   1092190|00000000||Got no time for this. You're dead.
   1092182|00000000||I freed Morkvarg.
   1092135|00000000||Morkvarg, the werewolf of Freya's garden - lifted his curse, and let him live.
   1093826|00000000||Werewool. Like you. Witchy-thingy like were-thingys. No you hurt too, maybe.
   1092160|00000000||Ye see? He's not that bad. We should let him go!
   1092162|00000000||Let him go? Now? So he can track us down and butcher us?
   1092164|00000000||I won't hurt you. I don't kill sentient creatures.
   1092166|00000000||You lie. Every witcher is a murderer hrrrrr!
   1092168|00000000||I kill monsters, true - it's my job. But only when they threaten humans.
   1094101|00000000||You hate us, hate us all!
   1094103|00000000||Humans hate you all. 'Cause they don't know you. Don't know which of you are dangerous, and which want to live in peace.
   1094105|00000000||Only witchers stand between you and humans. We know both worlds, protect both.
   1092704|00000000||We kill dangerous monsters so the thinking ones can live in peace.
   1092170|00000000||So ye say now, as ye stand there scared. Ye know we have the upper hand hrr hrrr hrrr!
   1092172|00000000||You don't. Could've killed you all long ago if I'd wanted to.
   1092174|00000000||I believe 'im. We should let 'im be.
   1092176|00000000||I'm all for it. To my thinkin', he's telling the truth.
   1092178|00000000||Let witchy-thingy go.
   1092181|00000000||Grrraaagh! Fools! Gullible as newborns!
   1092722|00000000||A just witcher, a kind witcher - a lying witcher, he feigns it all! All humans lie!
   1092724|00000000||Let it rest! This is not the way. Ye shan't bring Addalia back.
   1092726|00000000||Ggggragggh! Stay here, I'll finish this alone - hrr.
   1092133|00000000||Don't make me laugh. That's not nearly enough hrrrrrr…
   1092117|00000000||Vereena killed many an innocent. I had to do something.
   1092119|00000000||But I've helped monsters aplenty.
   1092121|00000000||Yes? Who?
   1092100|00000000||I've helped monsters on many occasions.
   1086183|00000000||Skellige Woman
   1090407|00000000||Nekker tracks. Wonder where they lead.
   1090004|00000000||What's going on here?
   1090399|00000000||You will die - for her! For my Addalia! Grraaagh!
   1090401|00000000||Uuuggghhrrrr!
   1090403|00000000||Heh, done with that.
   1098518|00000000||You're dead, witcher!
   1098521|00000000||Witchy-thingy mash make! For srooooop!
   1098523|00000000||Lucky bastard! Ye were to end as arachas fodder.
   1098525|00000000||Witchy-thingy kills! Kill witchy-thingy!
   1098527|00000000||What'd that poor troll ever do to you?!
   1090395|00000000||They've fled hrr! It doesn't matter. You're done!

   1086145|e5e26ccb||Ice Troll
   1091477|00000000||Trail ends here.
   1090479|00000000||Huh… who would think to hang drawings in a place like this?
   1090482|00000000||Looks like the work of a child… or someone who's damned clumsy with a quill.
   1090493|00000000||Huh, two sticks protruding above the shoulder. Think that might be… me.
   1090484|00000000||Is that a… wagon? And here's where that boulder almost crushed me.
   1093820|00000000||Nekker tracks near the boulder - now I know where they came from. Just wonder who actually left them.
   1090487|00000000||These balls on sticks are endregas. Guess they were supposed to finish me off.
   1090489|00000000||All in all, a pretty elaborate plan.
   1090491|00000000||And this must be the meeting place. Huh, looks like this whole "ambush" was a group effort.
   1090497|00000000||High time I met the pranksters.
   1055666|e2e56322||Endrega Worker
   1090002|00000000||A nekker's foot.
   1090454|00000000||Hollowed out inside, like a… boot. Someone lost it while running.
   1090456|00000000||The plot thickens.
    370227|f0d0bf53||Werewolf
    447384|67e07369||Endrega
   1090370|00000000||During his time in the village of Fyresdal Geralt learned of a contract on a monster said to have attacked a merchant and his cart. The merchant in question was very insistent that a witcher investigate this matter and kill the beast.
   1090371|00000000||Geralt refused to help the Skelliger, but then during his later travels happened across the damaged cart. Since he was already there, he decided to look for tracks…
   1090372|00000000||The trail ended as had so many before it - in a cave. This cave was different from its predecessors, however - inside were crude drawings showing a carefully planned attempt to take Geralt's life. From the last of these the witcher gleaned the location of a meeting of his would-be assassins. He decided to attend...
   1090373|00000000||Geralt found the monsters who had plotted a deadly trap for him, but soon realized these misguided beasts did not deserve death. Yet the pack's aggressive leader, a werewolf, burned with such hatred for Geralt that he attacked, even though his companions refused to join. The witcher quickly slew the werewolf, but left the other monsters unharmed.
   1090374|00000000||Geralt found the monsters who had plotted a deadly trap for him. The pack's aggressive leader, a werewolf, burned with such hatred for Geralt that he convinced two of the others - a doppler and a troll - to join him in attacking Geralt. The entire threesome died from the witcher's sword. Of the conspirators, only the godling survived, having snuck off somewhere before the fighting grew fierce.
   1090363|00000000||Find the site of the monsters' attack.
   1090364|00000000||Search the attack site using your Witcher Senses.
   1090365|00000000||Find the place where the boulder started.
   1090366|00000000||Follow the monster's tracks using your Witcher Senses.
   1090367|00000000||Kill the arachasae.
   1090368|00000000||Go to the conspirators' meeting spot at night.
   1090369|00000000||Defeat the werewolf.
   1090385|00000000||Examine the tracks in the cave.
   1091315|00000000||Find the person who posted the contract.
   1098330|00000000||Defeat the monsters.
   1090362|00000000||Contract: Skellige's Most Wanted
   1093818|00000000||You were right. Monsters are like men. Some're good, some're bad, and still others - simply lost…
   1093846|00000000||It's a right shame. He was different, once. Should never 'ave let him talk us into this.
   1093848|00000000||Here. A little somethin' from us… so you'll remember not all monsters are dangerous.
   1093850|00000000||Thanks.
    170749|06037cfd||Johnny
   1089161|00000000||Can't squeeze through there. Too bad. Whatever lured me here - and possibly pushed that boulder - fled this way.
   1091377|00000000||A nekker. Torn apart by something huge.
   1091456|00000000||Then someone cut its legs off.
   1089159|00000000||Nekker paw and… a human foot? Small, like a child's. Clearly running.
   1088524|00000000||The wagon. Need to look around.
   1088546|00000000||Must be the comrade of the fellow from Faroe. Hm, odd. Looks like he died of old age, not because a nekker ripped him apart.
   1090440|00000000||Gashes like claw marks in its flanks.
   1090442|00000000||But it's also got lockjaw and a warped spine… like it might've died of tetanus.
   1089145|00000000||Furrow looks fresh. Boulder must've rolled through here.
   1089149|00000000||A nekker. Must've waded through mud before arriving here.
   1089998|00000000||Boulder started here. Think I see some tracks…
   1089147|00000000||Nekker tracks - clear prints.
   1090297|00000000||Doesn't sound like a job for me.
   1090338|00000000||Sorry, got more important matters to tend to.
   1090340|00000000||No! Ye can't abandon me! Not like this!
   1090346|00000000||That hunter wanted to help you. Might still catch him if you hurry.
   1090348|00000000||But a witcher's what I need!
   1090350|00000000||Well this witcher's busy. Godspeed.
   1090352|00000000||But if… if ye happen to pass that way, look into it? Please?
   1090342|00000000||No means no. Farewell.
   1090341|00000000||Fine, I'll help.
   1091549|00000000||Fine. I'll do it. I'll help.
   1090318|00000000||Grand! Knew a witcher wouldn't let me down. Not like some waffly prick from Clan Drumdond…
   1090320|00000000||Or Clan Drummond.
   1090324|00000000||Good luck, witcher! Fare ye well!
   1090328|00000000||Wait. Where should I look for you?
   1090330|00000000||What?
   1090332|00000000||Once I finish. Where will I find you?
   1090334|00000000||Oh! Aye, aye. Umm… here. Meanin' in the tavern nearby. I'll await ye there.
   1090336|00000000||Fine. See ya.
   1090344|00000000||I'll help you.
   1090295|00000000||I'll help.
   1090296|00000000||Let's talk about my reward.
   1090299|00000000||Hm, don't know. You lost your transport, so I don't see how you're going to pay me. And I don't work for free.
   1090301|00000000||I've coin set aside, I'm sure we'll agree terms. How much would you ask?
   1090306|00000000||Ye see? I said we'd agree. So how'll it be?
   1090308|00000000||A fair price. So how'll it be?
   1090304|00000000||Excellent! It's a deal.
   1090274|00000000||Fine, what's this about - tell me.
   1090276|00000000||Me and my mate were on our way here to Fyresdal with a cart full o' hides.
   1090278|00000000||Suddenly we heard a screech. Our horse got spooked, started kickin' - and then, monsters jumped out o' the bushes!
   1090280|00000000||My mate drew the short straw - they got him first. By some miracle I managed to get away.
   1090282|00000000||What kind of monsters?
   1090284|00000000||Nekkuks, no doubt about it.
   1090286|00000000||What?
   1090288|00000000||You know, sharp claws, animal skulls on their heads, attack in swarms…
   1090290|00000000||Nekkers?
   1090292|00000000||Yeah, nekkers! Near twenty of 'em!
   1090294|00000000||So, will ye help? Will ye kill the bastards?
   1090314|00000000||That road needs be clear. Aim to travel it again soon.
   1090236|00000000||What's this about? Tell me.
   1090259|00000000||You from Faroe? Come a long way…
   1090265|00000000||That just happened. Came to Fyresdal to trade a load o' hides from Svorlag.
   1090269|00000000||Svorlag? Thought you were from Faroe - Svorlag's on Spikeroog.
   1090271|00000000||Uhh… ah, well ye see, first I sailed from Faroe to Svorlag. Traded some loot from the Continent for hides there, then came here.
   1090310|00000000||Faroe to Spikeroog to Ard Skellig… huh, roundabout journey.
   1090312|00000000||Ah, hadn't much choice, had I? A merchant sails where the trade's good, not where it's close at hand.
   1090238|00000000||Who are you?
   1090237|00000000||Why don't you want the locals' help?
   1090243|00000000||That hunter - could he be right? Maybe it was just wolves.
   1090245|00000000||I knows what I saw! Besides, who's he to say?
   1090247|00000000||Those Drummond blaggards don't know shite from shoelaces.
   1090249|00000000||That particular blaggard was wearing an Craite colors.
   1090251|00000000||Huh… ye sure about that?
   1090263|00000000||Surer than sure.
   1090253|00000000||Ach, doesn't matter. That lot's not to be trusted, either.
   1090255|00000000||Monsters attacked me. I need a witcher, not some hunter.
   1090210|00000000||What's the problem?
   1090212|00000000||A beast! It attacked me! Me and my comrade!

   1090202|00000000||Hey, a witcher! Oh, Freya be praised!
