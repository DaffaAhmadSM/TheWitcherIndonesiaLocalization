    380991|00000000||Found your miners. They went in a troll's cave and started mining… while the troll was home.
    380997|00000000||Did any…?
    442101|00000000||No. Troll won't be any more trouble, though.
    442103|00000000||Small comfort…
    510078|00000000||Still earned my reward.
    442105|00000000||Yea, here… Safe journey to ye.
    381031|00000000||Your miners are dead. Not one of you knew a troll lived there?
    381033|00000000||We'd heard mention of it, but…
    381035|00000000||But greed won out over reason.
    381037|00000000||Not your place to judge us. What about the troll?
    442107|00000000||Left him in peace - advise you to do the same.
    442109|00000000||Turned coward, ye mean? What kind o' monster slayer are ye? Outta my sight.
    446440|00000000||Here about the missing miners. Might be able to help… What happened?
    510006|00000000||Well, we'd heard tales o' silver in the northern hills. And seein' as coin's needed to ready longships for raids, we sent a few lads to see how much truth was in the tales… And, well, they've yet to return.
    510088|00000000||Might not be much silver in the hills… but there are monsters, definitely. I'll see if the miners came across any.
    510138|00000000||Thank ye, witcher.
    510080|00000000||I'll look around for them.
    429018|00000000||Farewell.
    429020|00000000||Farewell.
    510094|00000000||Sorry… Not interested.
    510082|00000000||Not interested.
    510081|00000000||Reward's too low.
    510090|00000000||Gotta start by searching for them. That'll take time… and drive up costs.
    510092|00000000||Long as they don't soar too high.
   1068258|00000000||What am I, a dragon sleepin' on a hoard o' gold?! I won't pay ye that, not on your life!
   1068260|00000000||Hrmph! A bit overboard, that. But a deal seems close.
   1068264|00000000||From the Continent, that's plain to see. Greedy and eager to feed on the misery of others. Enough of the bandyin'! Take what's offered or piss off!
   1068262|00000000||I can throw in a few crowns more… For the good of our lads… I'll let it stand. Deal.
    510084|00000000||Gave your offer some thought.
    510086|00000000||And?
    429016|00000000||Here about the missing miners.
    429013|00000000||Greetings, witcher.
   1138192|242431a3||Contract: Misssing Miners
   1138199|8b6213ad||Miners from a small Skellige village are disappearing. Investigate and find out what's happening!
   1081444|00000000||<br>A certain set of Skellige miners learned first-hand just how dangerous rock trolls can be. Ignoring all warnings, they started to mine a rich silver vein in the cave which Wham-a-Wham called home. They died soon thereafter - crushed or torn to rough bits. Perhaps this was a justified act of self-defense on the troll's part - but witchers are not judges. Witchers kill monsters.
   1083313|00000000||<br>A certain set of Skellige miners learned first-hand just how dangerous rock trolls can be. Ignoring all warnings, they started to mine a rich silver vein in the cave which Wham-a-Wham called home. They died soon thereafter - crushed or torn to rough bits. This time, a troll's killings were a justified act of self-defense - after all, the witcher reasoned, every troll's cave is his castle.
   1086969|00000000||Rock trolls come across as dim-witted, ponderous, slow - stupid, to be frank. It's easy to dismiss them - and even easier to enrage them. When this happens, one's best bet is to run as fast as possible, for an angered rock troll is as deadly as a thundering landslide. This truth held in the case of the massive rock troll known as Wham-a-Wham. His every blow struck like a battering ram - meaning one needed either avoid them entirely or protect oneself with the Quen Sign. Its hard skin meant it was near invulnerable to sword strikes - especially those dealt from behind, where its rock armor is the thickest. The only hope for defeating it lay in taking advantage of its typical troll slowness - especially if further exploited using the Yrden Sign.

   1081443|00000000||Wham-a-Wham
    380697|00000000||Man? Wham-a-wham go man! So wham go troll, too!
    380699|00000000||Wait. I wanna talk.
    380701|00000000||Talk…? Talk. But you calm. Or troll you wham-a-wham, like thems.
    380703|00000000||Exactly. Why'd you… wham 'em?
    380705|00000000||Thems in-walk troll house. Troll say, "Out mans!" But they wham-a-wham troll rocks. So troll wham, too!
    380719|00000000||From what you say, they were asking for trouble.. I'll let it slide, this time. But kill any other humans, and I'll come back and cut off your head. Understand?
    442048|00000000||No. Words-a-words many. Hurt head.
    442050|00000000||Lemme try again… Wham-a-Wham mans again, I'll swish-a-swash-a-swunk you.
    442052|00000000||Ah. No more troll wham. And this man take. For be good man and no swish-a-swash.
    375418|00000000||I'll let this slide. They were asking for it.
    375414|00000000||Won't get away with this.
    375420|00000000||Sorry, can't let you get away with this.
   1073558|00000000||Stop it! I wanna talk!
    370437|00000000||Kill the rock troll.
    375391|00000000||Talk to the rock troll and decide his fate.
    370429|00000000||Take a trophy from the rock troll.
    370430|00000000||Collect your reward.
    375392|00000000||Tell the village elder in Blandare what happened to the missing miners.
    427165|00000000||Check the notice board in Blandare.
    370427|00000000||Investigate the area around the missing miners' camp using your Witcher Senses.
    449047|00000000||Talk to the village elder in Blandare.
    370428|00000000||Travel to the missing miners' camp.
   1051009|00000000||Young men from the village of Blandare had ventured into the nearby mountains in search of silver. It seemed their expedition had taken an unfortunate turn, however - and the witcher was tasked with uncovering their fate.<br>
   1051010|00000000||It turned out a rock troll had taken residence in the caves near Blandare. Though such trolls are, in a certain sense, reasoning beings, they are often unthinkingly cruel and violent in their dealings with men.<br>
   1051011|00000000||Geralt decided that the troll had a right to defend its home and did not deserve to die. This naturally did not sit well with the villagers who had issued the contract, and they refused to pay the witcher a single copper. And so, not for the first time, Geralt walked away from a job empty-handed, save for the solace of having listened to his conscience.<br>
   1051905|00000000||The mountains ridges of Ard Skellig can be treacherous for those who get distracted by their snow-bound beauty. An errant step can send one tumbling down a cliff... or stumbling into the den of the monster whose tracks Geralt happened across while traversing the region...<br>
   1051906|00000000||Geralt defeated the rock troll and took its head to Blandare. He was justly rewarded for his efforts - and the villagers could now mine silver in peace and enjoy the steady income that entailed. In brief, everyone had reason to cheer... except for the troll, that is.<br>
   1051907|00000000||It seemed the rock troll was responsible for the Blandare miners' deaths. Though they knew the cave was inhabited and the troll warned them he did not take kindly to uninvited guests, the miners were not deterred. Greed had driven them to risk their lives for a few hunks of ore.<br>
