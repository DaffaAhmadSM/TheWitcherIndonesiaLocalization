    543163|00300c66||Yontek
    546438|00000000||Just three of us?! Our whole village, murdered, 'cause o' him!
    528922|00000000||You'd still be swine if not for me.
    529060|00000000||If not for me, you'd still be a pig. On a spit by now, most likely.
   1017694|00000000||Yontek brought me here. Lucky to have him among you.
   1017689|00000000||You got lucky.
   1017688|00000000||Didn't do it alone.
   1017693|00000000||Thank Yontek. He helped me a lot.
   1015686|00000000||First one to raise a hand against Yontek loses it.
   1015687|00000000||Now, now, we was just…
   1021033|00000000||Freak's likely to gut us - let's go from here, quick.
   1015688|00000000||Ooh, thanks!
   1015689|00000000||Probably shouldn't go back to the village, could end badly for you. Need to find another place for yourself.
   1017022|00000000||Uhh… Right. Whatever that means. Godspeed now.
   1005690|00000000||Won't let you hurt him.
   1016973|00000000||Oh, aye… Not all survived, though - can't give you much. Here - some coin.
   1017031|00000000||Time to go back. Got us a guilty man to hang…
   1017033|00000000||But naaay!
   1016972|00000000||Oh, aye… Good work, witcher, gotta say. Here's your coin.
   1015690|00000000||This… is no longer my concern.
   1015691|00000000||Good thing, too. Let's take 'im to the village. Make him pay for what he's done.
   1015692|00000000||Yeah. Speaking of pay…
   1005691|00000000||Helped enough. Not my concern anymore.
   1007372|00000000||But it were Yontek brought us the key!
   1021010|00000000||Must've known the gold was cursed! He didn't wanna go with us!
    529042|00000000||But… I didn't… 'Twas Igor! Igor wanted…
   1015683|00000000||Won't get out of this, dung breath! Get 'im!
   1017013|00000000||Help me.
    529029|00000000||Saved as many of you as I could.
    528921|00000000||Did what I could…
    528934|00000000||Not many of us left.
    528935|00000000||Tis his fault!
    528937|00000000||We're almost all of us.
   1017691|00000000||Thank ye, White One.
    546436|00000000||We's all here! Well… 'cept for Yagoda.
    528923|00000000||I'm meself again. Thank ye.
    543625|00000000||Too early for joy. We need a headcount… o' human heads.
   1015679|00000000||What'd you do?! There's just Igor!
   1015680|00000000||Where's the others…?
   1015681|00000000||Did what I could.
   1015682|00000000||Ain't no folk, all's lost! Let's go!
   1016927|00000000||Back to the village?
   1016929|00000000||Ain't no village! Ain't no us! C'mon, Igor!
    533343|00000000||It's done! We can go.
   1016635|00000000||Done scurried off! Get 'em!
   1016636|00000000||Hey, who, whoa whoa whoa whoa! They's a-fleein'!
   1016634|00000000||They's a-fleein'! Chase 'em!
   1016678|00000000||That's the way! They''s followin' us.

   1005599|00000000||Hrr hrr hrr hrr!
   1005605|00000000||Wait, that sounded like… You understand me?
   1005607|00000000||Hrr!
   1016958|00000000||All right, let's try this. One oink for yes, two for no. Got it?
   1016960|00000000||Hrr!
    526619|00000000||Think I know what happened…
    543603|00000000||We're in a temple, and there was a tub full of gold here. Yontek found the key, showed it to the villagers, and they got greedy…
    550156|00000000||Thing is, no one realized the gold might be protected by a curse.
    543606|00000000||Hrrr… hr hr hrw…
    543607|00000000||To lift it, we gotta bring back the gold. I should ask Yontek, maybe he knows where it is…
    526620|00000000||Hrr rwee rwee!
    532071|00000000||Think I understand what happened.
    526615|00000000||Is this a temple?
    526724|00000000||We in a temple?
    526725|00000000||Hrrooo…
    526726|00000000||This a tomb?
    526727|00000000||Hrr hrr!
   1015872|00000000||Hmm….
    526616|00000000||Is this a tomb?
    526697|00000000||Know this place?
    526698|00000000||Hrr…
    526622|00000000||What is this place?
   1015873|00000000||There was gold here… Know what happened to it?
   1015878|00000000||Hrr. Hrr.
   1015880|00000000||Hmm. Gotta talk to Yontek about this.
   1015869|00000000||Where's the gold?
    531165|00000000||I'll come back later.
    522204|00000000||So long.
    522205|00000000||See you later.
    522206|00000000||Hrrrooo…
   1017227|00000000||Wait here. I should look around.
   1017229|00000000||Hrrr hr…
   1017225|00000000||I'll look around.
    526621|00000000||Who are you?
    526690|00000000||Yontek mentioned that only the herbalist and the ealdorman were missing from the village… Makes you one of them.
    526691|00000000||Hrr!
    526731|00000000||You Klaus, the village ealdorman?
    526732|00000000||Hrr hrr!
    526656|00000000||You the ealdorman?
    526657|00000000||You the herbalist?
    526733|00000000||You're the local herbalist?
    526734|00000000||Hrr!
    526735|00000000||Heard about you. Igor?
   1005593|00000000||Hrroom!
   1005595|00000000||Nice to meet you, I'm Geralt.
    526663|00000000||All right, let's talk…
    526664|00000000||Hrrroom!
    522217|00000000||Let's talk.
    526692|00000000||Take care - and don't get grilled.
    526693|00000000||Hrr!
    526609|00000000||Take care of yourself, piggy.
    526699|00000000||Here - something to eat.
    526694|00000000||Don't know how long you've been here, but you gotta be hungry. Got something tasty for you…
    526700|00000000||Hrrr hee hee hrr hrr…
    526701|00000000||Guess it was tasty.
    522199|00000000||I'm back.
    522200|00000000||Hrrrrr…
   1050873|00000000||During his travels through Velen, Geralt survived many a bizarre adventure, but few more memorable than that which I will now recount. For who would have thought a routine stop in a village strangely empty save a few bandits arguing with a local dunce would end in such a curious fashion? The witcher surely didn't, though he did have his suspicions...<br>
   1050874|00000000||Before long, Geralt had unraveled the riddle of the Village of the Swine. He discovered its inhabitants had broken into the treasury of some forgotten god, made off with the gold that was his by divine right and were cursed into hogs as a result. The witcher lifted the villagers' curse, but something of the swine must have remained within them, for as soon as they could utter something more than a grunt, they began tossing around baseless accusations. Yontek became their scapegoat and Geralt had to defend the poor fool from lynching. Alas, such is human nature - we are ungrateful and hypocritical to the point where one almost prefers the company of pigs.

The witcher lifted the villagers' curse, but something of the swine must have remained within them, for as soon as they could utter something more than a grunt, they began tossing around baseless accusations.

   1054592|00000000||After he dealt with the bandits and talked to the fool, Yontek, he set about visiting the village's huts and the pigs who dwelt in them. Yes, that's right - pigs.<br><br>Geralt quickly realized they were not merely farm animals running amok while their masters were away. After all, in this time Velen was gripped by famine and people had long ago eaten all domestic animals. The pigs were, in fact, the cursed inhabitants of the village themselves. With Yontek's help Geralt started to investigate this curious matter.<br>

   1072884|00000000||Get moving. Towards the mill, piggies. Wait for me there.
    520773|00000000||You hurt?
    520774|00000000||Oh… Ah… Nay. But Yagoda - oh zounds! They done cooked her!

   1016526|00000000||No time for this.
   1016522|00000000||The pigs are magic?
   1016524|00000000||They sure is! See for yourself!
    521496|00000000||Piggy magic?
    543188|00000000||Why isn't there anyone else around?
    543191|00000000||Live in this village alone?
    543192|00000000||Nay. They's home! Flap and Hagel and Bebon. Only Klaus and Igor 'ave gone missin'.
    543193|00000000||Who are Klaus and Igor?
    543194|00000000||Igor's the fool that'd eat grass. Klaus, he's the ealdorman. Every man knows Klaus.

    527901|00000000||Go, go move!

   1016628|00000000||Pigs ran off… Let's go back.
    543344|00000000||Gotta go back for the pigs. They've scattered.
   1016632|00000000||Gotta get 'em together again. Damn pigs.
   1016630|00000000||Dammit, they ran off.
    524472|00000000||Hey, where the hell--?
   1138194|fc3ef6ac||Quest: Fool's Gold
   1138203|ed960c44||Geralt and a village idiot team up to learn the secret of a settlement inhabited entirely by pigs.
    523240|00000000||A lot of people came through here, and there was something heavy.
    572229|00000000||At least a few people were here… dragged something out.
    532461|00000000||One gold coin at the bottom… Gold must've been kept here.
    523225|00000000||Grass stains on the shirt… And an herb sack underneath. Must be that herbalist's, Igor's.
   1072882|00000000||"Hog hut" - makes sense now.
    521532|00000000||The pigs… they do seem to be magic.
    521533|00000000||Aye, 'cause… er… 'cause all th-- 'cause o' the sorcery. It done turned 'em all that way.
   1004925|00000000||So those pigs, they used to be humans?
   1004927|00000000||Aye! What did you think?
   1004929|00000000||Help 'em! Turn 'em back!
    526343|00000000||Need to take a closer look at the, uh, hog hut. Where is it?
   1005586|00000000||Why, it's thataway, past the hill. You walk and walk, and then you're there. Got it?
   1005588|00000000||I'll find it.
    521565|00000000||Gotta look around this "hog hut."
    526348|00000000||Where'd you get the key?
    526349|00000000||Mhmhmhmh! I found it! Showed it to Igor, right, and he told all the folks to go! Then, they was changed.
    521536|00000000||Where'd you get the key?
    521521|00000000||I'll be back.
    521599|00000000||Come back to see you later.
    521600|00000000||Aye, gert!
    521538|00000000||We'll talk later.
    521535|00000000||What turned the people into pigs?
    526346|00000000||What changed the people into pigs?
    526347|00000000||Twere magic! I done gave Igor the key, he gathered 'em all, off they went.
   1004931|00000000||What key is this?
   1004933|00000000||This 'un! Here! Opens the hog hut, that does.
   1017467|00000000||About these… people… What happened to them?
   1017469|00000000||Done changed! In the hog hut. Gave you the key, remember?
    526332|00000000||About the pigs…
    543622|00000000||Some gold was stolen - that's what caused the curse. Know where the gold is?
   1016948|00000000||I done hid it!
    573189|00000000||Well, you gotta return it, and all the… villagers need to be there when you do.
    543623|00000000||Oh… What?
   1005633|00000000||Get the gold, and I'll get the pigs together. Meet by the mill, and we'll all go to the hog hut. It oughta work.
    545756|00000000||We's gonna save 'em! I'll get the gold.
    543611|00000000||Where's the gold?
    543612|00000000||You weren't cursed. Why?
    543617|00000000||You weren't transformed like the other villagers… Gotta say I'm curious why.
   1017569|00000000||We-- 'Cause I didn't go with 'em?
   1017571|00000000||You didn't take any gold from the temple?
    543620|00000000||Uhhhh… nay. Why would I?
    521530|00000000||Finally know what happened to the locals. They fell victim to a curse.
    550617|00000000||Ooh… sooo… can you "uncurse" 'em?
    543609|00000000||Yes, but I'll need your help.
    550623|00000000||Oh - oh, all right.
    521520|00000000||About the curse…

   1021632|00000000||Don't mess up now… Three leftaways, twice rightaways… Or were it thrice rightaways? Ooh.
   1021576|00000000||Never you mind… Yagoda, you was good, you'll go to heaven.
   1021577|00000000||Hocus-pocus-ala-docus...!
   1021637|00000000||Mhh, still piggies. Didn't help.
    526411|00000000||They's all here! 'Cept for Igor…
    526412|00000000||Igor's waiting for us. Remember, once we're there, put the gold back where it was.
    526413|00000000||You gets the pigs. I'll do the carryin' and droppin' off.
    516809|00000000||Meat's just about ready - needs a smidgen more.
    516810|00000000||Let them gudgeons starve, we've got us a feast!
    516811|00000000||It's a pisser, ain't it? A pack o' fattened oinkers in the middle o' nothin'.
    546349|00000000||No point ponderin' it. Just dig in.
    591369|00000000||No, thanks.
    591376|00000000||I'll pass, thanks.
   1007147|00000000||Your loss. Caius, cut us off another hunk.
   1006533|00000000||He hasn't harmed you. Leave him alone.
   1006534|00000000||We go all chummy-like, offer you roast hog, and you do this?
   1006535|00000000||No grockle's gonna give us orders. Clobber 'im, lads!
   1006531|00000000||Leave him alone or you'll regret it.
   1006537|00000000||Staying out of this.
   1006538|00000000||For the love! Help! They'll kill me…! Like they did Yagoda…!
   1006539|00000000||Get 'im, boys!
   1006532|00000000||I'm staying out of this.
   1006525|00000000||Nooooo! I won't stand for it! They done roasted Yagoda! The wazzacks!
   1006526|00000000||Urgh. Him again! You want another bannickin'?
   1006527|00000000||What's this about?
   1006528|00000000||They slaughtered Yagoda! Cooked her up! Wazzacks!
   1006529|00000000||Same old song… Nothin' doing, gotta wallop him. Caius, Jacob - grab him!
   1006530|00000000||Nay! Shan't be! Heeelp!
    591373|00000000||Gladly.
   1007144|00000000||Caius! Cut the gentlemen a slice o' piglet.
    591368|00000000||Lemme try a bit.
    591401|00000000||Quite the banquet. Where'd you get all the meat?
    591402|00000000||Found porkers womblin' all about, so we roasted one of 'em.
    591403|00000000||Wanna bite? Plenty to go 'round.
    525952|00000000||A pig like any other. Medallion didn't budge.
    526277|00000000||Yeaah, definitely magic.
    528109|00000000||Last one. Village is safe… for now.
    521455|00000000||Ordinary pig, by the looks of it, but my medallion's going wild. Yontek's right, they're enchanted.
    532186|00000000||Don't be afeared. Gather the lot and we're off.
