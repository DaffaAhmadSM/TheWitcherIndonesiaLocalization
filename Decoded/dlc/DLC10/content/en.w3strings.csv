   1071244|256561ab||Read for additional information.
   1215276|0065d59d||[illegible fragment] ...we all make mistakes, for to err is human. The key is to learn from one's errors. If something breaks, it must be fixed. And if our mistake harms another, the injured party must be recompensed for his frazzled nerves and lost time.<br><br>We thus apologize and ask for forgiveness. Evil is not what we do!<br>C. de P.R.
   1109254|4a42c120||Hieronymus' notes
   1109257|6259f0ec||My study of Elgar's armor has allowed me to devise new alloys and increase the magic conductivity of the second crystal. This might be the breakthrough I needed in my work on the teleport. For my trial run, I have calibrated the portal to exit in the cave near the tower's base. I need now only charge the crystal with solar energy, for which purpose I have placed it in the outer wall of the tower, near the scaffolding. Only hours remain before it is entirely charged!<br><br>I have finished my work on a diagram which will allow us to replicate this armor and equip the entire School of the Wolf with it. Varin, the witchers' fencing instructor, has taken credit for this find, but it was I who, using logical deduction and only a slight dollop of magic assistance, uncovered the chamber where Elgar must have once resided. The space was hidden behind a primitive illusion, one needed merely look carefully to see through it. I found notes which indicate Elgar had worked out diagrams for improvements to his equipment which he then hid for safekeeping in various locations around the world. Careful study of his notes allowed me to write up instructions on how to find these upgrades. I went to the old watchtower and gave this research to Chird. As soon as he finishes preparing the silver sword diagram, he will set out to gather all the upgrade diagrams. Varin has the finished steel sword diagram and will begin forging blades based on it. I hope he will distribute them to the poor lads he trains - they at least deserve proper equipment after going through the horror he calls training.<br><br>By the gods - I think I see fire on the horizon, coming from where the old watchtower stands! I can also hear some kind of commotion outside my tower.<br><br>The way down is blocked - what is going on?!
   1100403|203d5551||Varin's journal
   1100404|1979535b||Elgar's gear is fantastic. I knew it at once, soon as I found it. Right away I said every new witcher we train should be given such equipment - that is, if we are serious about making monster slayers out of this band of prissy schoolboys.<br><br>How many times must I ask our honorable resident mage to devote some of his precious time to actual work! Resident like that's as useful as a boil on the bottom. At least his assistant, Chird, knows a thing or two about metallurgy. The two of them have finally gotten down to work.<br><br>The steel sword diagram is now ready, and, assuming they didn't foul anything up, tomorrow I'll forge the first blade. I'll go to Chird's workshop in the old watchtower after today's training and see if he's finished the silver sword diagram as he promised. Then I'll go to Hieronymus' tower - he should have finished that armor diagram by now.<br><br>Thought I heard a signal horn in the distance a second ago. Hooch must be getting to my head. No one's fool enough to attack a keep full of witchers.
   1108370|6c1f0631||Journal kept by Chird, the mage Hieronymus' assistant
   1108371|e5632e7b||I write in great haste, for each moment might bring my demise. A band of peasants wielding all manner of sharp or heavy farmyard implements has stormed the keep. I was in the workshop when they attacked, working on a new silver sword diagram, and did not notice the mob's approach. I have barricaded the doors but know this cannot last forever. I can only hope Varin will come and rescue me before they break through.<br><br>Luckily we completed work on a new steel sword diagram a few days ago and gave it to Varin to forge. Armed with this fine weapon and aided by his witcher pupils, I'm sure he'll easily handle a bunch of peasants swinging hoes and rakes. Yet even rakes can do great harm to an unarmed scholar such as my master. Hieronymus has been shut up in his tower for days, absorbed in his work on a new armor diagram. He might remain oblivious still to the danger he is in. Should the mob find him before Varin can slice them down... <br><br>And to think I nearly escaped this nightmare! If I had only listened to my master... Hieronymus had drawn up some notes for me on locations connected with the legendary Elgar, a witcher of the School of the Wolf. It is said Elgar had devised some improvements to the School's gear, and I was to follow his trail in search of these diagrams. Had I left even as late as yesterday, I would have been a safe distance from Kaer Morhen by the time the mob attacked. Instead, I tarried, and now I cower, fearing for my life...
   1108367|6c494cb4||Notes written in a shaky hand
   1108368|c23f81d8||Cannot move. Spine broken, liver (perhaps spleen?) pierced. Knew jumping into portal was extremely risky with only 1 crystal powering it - but still better than certain death at hands of enraged peasants. Mob broke into tower, cut off path to second crystal. Had to flee. Grabbed diagrams for Wolf School gear before going - hoping Varin would come save them, if not me. Perhaps he will come still, will jump through the portal, retrieve his diagrams, rescue me... A foolish hope. My time is very short.
   1100441|867ab9da||Slightly torn notes by Hieronymus on the witcher Elgar
   1108360|9fc25c72||It seems Elgar hid some upgrades to his gear in the area around Kaer Morhen. Some he hid in the deepest cave he could find, the one in the northern portion of the Kaer Morhen valley. Others he hid in the  abandoned, crumbling watchtower in the same area. Still others he placed amidst the rocks on the shore of the valley's lake.
   1100442|db0c3789||Damp, moldy notes by Hieronymus on the witcher Elgar
   1108361|f6371423||Elgar hid further improvements to the equipment used by the School of the Wolf in various regions of the Skellige Isles. He put some in a wooden fort in southern Ard Skellig. Another set he hid in the ruins in the western portion of Hindarsfjall. A third stash was hidden in the burial mounds found in western Ard Skellig.
   1104865|867ab9f9||Heavily faded notes by Hieronymus on the witcher Elgar
   1108362|d4a897b3||Elgar placed upgrades to School of the Wolf witcher gear in three different caves in the area immediately to the south of Kaer Morhen. He hoped future generations of witchers would find them in an hour of need.
   1104866|867aba18||Notes on parchment by Hieronymus on Elgar the witcher
   1108364|098ed2f4||Some of the improvements to School of the Wolf gear are hidden in the Skellige Isles. Elgar left them in the central part of Ard Skellig and in the ruins of two watchtowers: one on Undvik, one on Spikeroog. He wanted them to be available for witchers who need them and are clever enough to find them.
   1100439|867ab9d9||Well-preserved notes by Hieronymus on the witcher Elgar
   1108358|9e0d83d3||For safekeeping, Elgar hid his improvements to the School of the Wolf's equipment in multiple locations. One set he hid in an underwater cave beneath a castle in central Velen. Another he left in a cave to the south of Oxenfurt, while a third he placed in the elven ruins found on a small isle in southern Velen.
   1100443|db0c378a||Worn-out and faded notes by Hieronymus on the witcher Elgar
   1108363|f7ebecc2||Elgar hid improvements for School of the Wolf gear in various corners of the world, so that witchers could make use of them on the Path. Some he hid in elven ruins and a sunken ship in the south of Velen.. Others he put in a hideout far to the south of Oxenfurt.
