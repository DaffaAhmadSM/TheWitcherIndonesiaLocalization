   1121168|00000000||Vimme, could you do me a favor?
   1121861|00000000||Och! Afeared not.
   1121863|00000000||You can't?
   1121865|00000000||Ye see, eheh, I've been told you owe back taxes. And that means I cannae provide ye any services till ye take care o' that wee fuckup.
   1121878|00000000||Agh, fine. I'll just pay it.
   1121875|00000000||Fine. I'll pay the debt.
   1121880|00000000||Don't know that I ever intend to pay that "debt." Definitely not now. So long, Vimme.
   1121876|00000000||Can't do it now.
   1121874|00000000||Geralt… No offense, pal, but if ye dinnae pay those tax arrears, I cannae do shite for ye.

   1118888|00000000||Wizardry!
   1118880|00000000||I live! I die! I live again!
   1118882|00000000||Oh, what a day! What a lovely day!
   1118894|00000000||You shall die! Die!
   1118890|00000000||Sing, brothers! Sing! Sing!
   1118892|00000000||I witness you, brother!
   1118884|00000000||Witness me, brothers!
   1098937|00000000||Well, well. Complications, complications…
   1100514|00000000||You owe us an explanation… Ewald Borsodi.
   1098927|00000000||Think you owe us an explanation… Ewald Borsodi. This family reunion - what's the point?
   1098947|00000000||Generous offer, Horst. Believe I'll take it.
   1100541|00000000||Well, hard not to agree with that. Sorry, Ewald.
   1100545|00000000||You see? All have turned against you. Once again. This time for the last time.
   1100544|00000000||Yet to be seen. I'll not go quietly.
   1098949|00000000||What?! How dare you?!
   1100527|00000000||Hate to be taken for a ride - said that from the start. Should've treated it seriously.
   1137262|00000000||Ugh… Of two evils, guess I prefer you, Horst.
   1098944|00000000||Tempting offer, Horst. I'm in, I'm with you.
   1098951|00000000||A desperate attempt at bribery. Going once, twice, thrice… Hm, no takers, no sale.
   1100529|00000000||Speak for yourself. Temptin' offer. I've succumbed.
   1100531|00000000||You'll pay for that, Quinto. With your head. At them!
   1100535|00000000||Aw, we'll take whatever we please. Once we've ripped your runners from yer arse.
   1100537|00000000||Hallowed words, mate. At 'em!
   1137259|00000000||If that's your attitude, I'll stand with Ewald.
   1098945|00000000||Can't bribe me. I'll stick to Ewald.
   1137250|00000000||Not about to meddle in your grimy matters.
   1137252|00000000||Not about to meddle, especially not in family matters.
   1137255|00000000||Then you'd have done better not to break into my vault.
   1137257|00000000||I fear it's too late to turn neutral. Stand with me, and I shall drape you in gold. Stand against me, and you'll remain here forever.
   1098931|00000000||Revenge. For betrayal. Years of poverty, humiliation.
   1098933|00000000||Father left the auction house to me in his will. Horst cheated me. Had me disinherited.
   1098935|00000000||Anything, everything we earned you squandered on cards and whores! Father didn't see that! I did!
   1100518|00000000||That's no excuse, Horst. And it won't save your life.
   1100521|00000000||You two! Stand with me! I'll not let the Redanians lay a hand on you! Give you whatever you want!
   1098925|00000000||Right. Should've known. Same eyes, same double chin, same rotten heart.
   1100516|00000000||Just one question. This family reunion - what's the point?
   1100513|00000000||Should've known.
   1098939|00000000||Stone me stupid and slap me happy.
   1098886|00000000||You don't know who you're fucking with!
   1098919|00000000||On the contrary. I know all too well.
   1098921|00000000||…
   1100510|00000000||E-Ewald?!
   1100512|00000000||Greetings, brother. Been years.

   1127191|00000000||Found your diagrams.
   1127201|00000000||Managed to recover all your diagrams.
   1127203|00000000||Ah, one to be relied on, this I knew! You restore the faith I might have in men, for I've now received aid from a stranger in even this land most barbarous.
   1127734|00000000||Don't mention it, really.
   1127736|00000000||As agreed, I shall draft you duplicates, though it may take a day. Be so kind as to return the morrow. Your reward I will have for you.
   1127205|00000000||All right. Tomorrow, then.
   1127206|00000000||Here to pick up those diagrams.
   1127208|00000000||The diagrams, their duplicates - ready?
   1127210|00000000||In fact, yes. They are yours to take, with my gratitude.
   1127212|00000000||Thanks. Farewell to you.

   1111067|00000000||Graaaah!
   1111264|00000000||So, how should I address you?
   1111266|00000000||As you did now. We'd rather keep our names to ourselves.
   1111244|00000000||Arrrggh!

   1128494|00000000||Who are you?
   1128496|00000000||Damn!

   1114938|00000000||Robbing a building requires, at a bare minimum, finding a way inside it. The mysterious man who convinced Geralt to take part in the heist determined the only way to break into the carefully guarded auction house was via an adjacent tower. Geralt thus needed to hire someone capable of climbing up its glass-smooth outer wall and dropping a line down to the others. Only two maestros of the burglar's trade could perform such a feat: Hugo Hoff, affectionately known as "Beef Patty," and Eveline Gallo, alias  "the Ermine."<br>
   1114939|00000000||Unfortunately, Hugo Hoff was unable to join the witcher's crew. The reason was a common one in criminal circles – someone had fitted him with a stone necktie and tossed him in a deep stretch of the Pontar. The halfling had learned the hard way that, all too often, crime does not pay.<br>
   1114940|00000000||In the end, Geralt recruited Eveline Gallo to join the heist. This was not a very difficult task – he had the impression the performer was just waiting for an excuse to escape from the circus tent for a moment and once again savor the taste of a true adventure.<br>
   1107464|00000000||Convince Eveline Gallo to participate in the robbery.
   1107467|00000000||Shoot the apples with your crossbow.
   1107468|00000000||Talk to Eveline about joining your crew.

   1115216|00000000||I'll bloody show you.
   1115218|00000000||Do I ever love this job!
   1115213|00000000||What now, wolf?
   1115212|00000000||Aye, Geralt?
   1137321|00000000||I'd have preferred to resolve this elsewise. Stolen the scrolls, thrown you out into the street. Revenge is best served cold, after all.
   1137323|00000000||But I don't mind servin' it hot. No.
   1137325|00000000||I beg you. Mercy! For your brother! I shall do anything you ask!
   1137327|00000000||Truly? Anythin'?
   1137329|00000000||Anything!
   1137331|00000000||Sign over to me all that you own. Then walk out as you stand, with just the clothing on your back.
   1137333|00000000||Allow me one thing. Any one thing!
   1137336|00000000||Fifteen years! In the sewers! Beggin'! Like a beast! And you've the cheek… to plead?!
   1137339|00000000||Take that.
   1114338|00000000||I'd have preferred to resolve this elsewise. Stolen the scrolls, thrown you out into the street. Revenge is best served cold, after all.
   1114340|00000000||But I don't mind servin' it hot. No.

   1114356|00000000||Take that.
   1114321|00000000||Look. Even your accomplices have turned against you.
   1114323|00000000||But not I. A brother once, a brother always. I'm prepared to forgive you.
   1114325|00000000||Is that so?
   1114327|00000000||On one condition - that you acknowledge me as head of the family. And bow before me.
   1114330|00000000||I might've fallen prey… had I not known you.
   1114332|00000000||But I do, Ewald. The bad shilling that always turns up.
   1114335|00000000||Bathe and dress him for the funeral. Something presentable - I'll not have him bring me more shame.
   1104766|00000000||Lots of scratches on the floor. Hm… just here, though.
   1104762|00000000||Single place setting, no others on the table.
   1127500|00000000||You actually ate from these bowls?
   1131907|00000000||Of course not. I already told you, we're not animals.
   1131909|00000000||But the Caretaker would set them out all the same. As ordered.
   1118836|00000000||Olgierd von Everec failed to understand we'd never be able to replace him.
   1118838|00000000||His specter now casts a shadow over Lady Iris' every remembrance.
   1111292|00000000||Another monstrosity? I begged you to stop this. Those two are two too many as it is.
   1117066|00000000||The dog and cat keep you company. This one will protect you, care for the house. No matter what happens.
   1117072|00000000||Before, I wished to know what was going on in that head of yours. I thought perhaps I could help.
   1126919|00000000||Now I care not the slightest what you think or how you feel.
   1126921|00000000||I… feel nothin'.
   1126923|00000000||Just as I no longer know if I still hate you. Go, Olgierd. I want you out of my sight.
   1104764|00000000||Animal hair.
   1098955|00000000||I remember… We spent much time together here, the three of us.
   1131891|00000000||In silence.
   1131893|00000000||We'll take our places. The same as then.
   1131895|00000000||You do the rest.
   1128568|00000000||So he was present, too.
   1127108|00000000||Claw scratches.
   1131910|00000000||A platter… Hmm…
   1131912|00000000||Small bowl. For soup, maybe?
   1131914|00000000||A large clay bowl…
   1132117|00000000||Hmm… something's not right…
   1132119|00000000||Think this was yours.
   1132121|00000000||There we go.
   1132123|00000000||Got something wrong.
   1132125|00000000||Perfect match.
   1132127|00000000||Probably not right…
   1128126|00000000||And the Order of the Flaming Rose shouldn't be brewing narcotics.
   1128134|00000000||So you've become bandits.
   1128137|00000000||So you turned rogue. That your idea? Wonder what Siegfried of Denesle would say.
   1128139|00000000||Siegfried of Denesle would-- But how do you even--?
   1128135|00000000||Congratulations. And goodbye.
   1128141|00000000||What can I say? You've done well. Before long you'll be another Salamandra. Congratulations. I'm outta here.
   1128144|00000000||Salamandra? Wait, wait…
   1128146|00000000||I know you. You're Geralt of Rivia. Jacques de Aldersberg's killer.
   1128148|00000000||None other. And if I had to go back, I'd do it again.
   1128150|00000000||That was the start of our downfall. You were the beginning, accursed mutant! Draw your blade.
   1128152|00000000||No need to yell. Just ask, politely.
   1125489|00000000||Honestly? Couldn't give a shit about your grief. Not the tiniest, runniest, greenest little shit in the world.
   1125491|00000000||You persecuted others, destroyed them. Now you've met with that same fate. So, you got exactly what you deserved.
   1128116|00000000||A witcher-moralist. Amusing. But… feel I've met you somewhere before.
   1128133|00000000||Honestly, don't give a damn.
   1128128|00000000||True, we shouldn't. We're supposed to defend the downtrodden. Spread faith in the Eternal Fire.
   1128130|00000000||But Radovid tricked us. He broke his oath, sent our brethren to the front as common grunts. And once the mighty Order was bled dry, he disbanded us.
   1128402|00000000||Took our lands, confiscated our demesnes to finance his war. The brethren who didn't object were appointed mage hunters. Those who took umbrage, dared to stand up to him, they were imprisoned or exiled.
   1128132|00000000||We're but a handful who still wear the colors. And we must find a new place in this world.
   1128124|00000000||And knights of the Flaming Rose shouldn't be murdering humans. Or producing drugs.
   1128118|00000000||Bloody hell? Who the devil are you?
   1128120|00000000||I'm a witcher. Or, as your brethren prefer to call me - a "mutant," a "freak."
   1128122|00000000||You shouldn't be in here.

   1125176|00000000||Got a painting I'm looking to sell.
   1125178|00000000||Good for you. But why come to me about it?
   1125180|00000000||Cause it's a van Rogh. Heard you might--
   1125182|00000000||A van Rogh?! I'll take it! Now, where's my purse…?
   1125315|00000000||Hm. I haven't much just now. But I'll add a bit of loot. Another witcher left it as collateral. What was his name? Gaetan?
   1125184|00000000||That so? Interesting… Thanks.
   1137138|00000000||When Geralt visited Olgierd von Everec to hear his third and final wish, he learned the rough and rowdy ataman had once been married. At some point he had left his wife, however, and gave her a violet rose as a parting gift. Geralt's task was to find this rose somewhere in the von Everecs' abandoned manor. When he arrived there, he discovered the estate was haunted by a malicious wraith tied to Olgierd's wife, Iris, who had died of loneliness years prior. Her rage and remorse now filled her former house with evil energy.<br>
   1137139|00000000||Geralt gathered up Iris' remains and buried them in the manor's garden. He did this both out of simple human decency and cold calculation, for he knew this act would calm her unsettled spirit and lead him to the violet rose. During the funeral a now quieted Iris appeared to Geralt and took him on a journey to a world which existed only in her mind. This "painted world" consisted of her fears and memories, which Geralt now had to confront.<br>
   1137140|00000000||Iris von Everec's memories first recalled happy days spent in Olgierd's company, then became darker and darker. In fact, even the sunnier ones had an ominous cloud hanging over them – an uneasy feeling something horrible would soon happen. Iris von Everec had been a sensitive woman and noted subtle changes in her husband's behavior. She had lacked the courage, however, to delve into their cause.<br>
   1137141|00000000||Olgierd von Everec’s heart had turned to stone, turning him into a monster. Iris hated what her husband had become, but could not stop loving him. The couple endured together in a painful cohabitation until Olgierd ended it by abandoning his wife. Iris never came to terms with their separation, could not, in fact, even bring herself to read her husband’s farewell letter. Yet the violet rose he gave her upon leaving she kept, making it a focal point for all the longing and love raging in her soul. When she died, these unresolved feelings kept her spirit in this world and continued to cause her suffering.<br><br>The witcher’s intervention helped Iris accept what had happened to her and her husband. When he asked for the rose, she agreed to give it him, knowing this would put a final end to her pain and suffering – and also her very existence.

She was now free to dissolve into the ether, but the thought of this horrified her. She thus entrusted her fate to the witcher, who was unwilling to deprive her of existence. She thus remained in our world by entering a painting which Geralt then delivered to Olgierd. Her sad eyes stared out at him from that canvas for the rest of his life.

   1131147|00000000||Didn't bargain for no storm. Afeared that means a tidy jump in my fee.
   1131149|00000000||To Ofier get us safely. The king's reward will be generous.
   1131152|00000000||What about the prisoner?

   1131158|00000000||Can't we just bring your king the bastard's head? Like we're doin' with the other?
   1131160|00000000||The other drowned. We could do nothing. We deliver live this one.
   1131162|00000000||Apart from all else, the hell the king is sure to condemn him to, I wish to see it.
   1131164|00000000||What kind of hell?
   1131166|00000000||Tarring, flaying and quartering - this the punishment for regicide entails.

   1125161|00000000||Looking for someone named Folkert. Light-haired halfling. Ring any bells?
   1125163|00000000||Aye, saw a little one 'round here. Out pickin' herbs.
   1126683|00000000||Mhm… Till he got hurt. Ran across a trail of blood. Trail led me here.
   1126685|00000000||Tis just as you say! Wolves had attacked him, he fled here seekin' shelter. I told him, "Back to your city, young master, plenty such dangers hereabouts." But the fool were stubborn, said he had to pick his blooms aforehand.
   1126688|00000000||Ventured back into the woods… and that were the last of him. Heard howlin' that night, sent shivers down me spine.
   1126690|00000000||So where're his remains? Wolves would've left something - his boots, maybe.
   1126692|00000000||Didn't go lookin'. We's too old to go trampin' about in the woods.
   1125036|00000000||Looking for Folkert, an herbalist's apprentice.
   1126696|00000000||Do better to give an old couple some peace!
   1126694|00000000||You know what happened to the Folkert fellow! My woman told you!
   1125217|00000000||Blood stains in the hut next door - know anything about that?
   1125219|00000000||Aye, 'course. Judd guts game in there.
   1126594|00000000||In someone else's hut?
   1126596|00000000||None live there no more, see? And workin' 'neath a roof, it's more pleasant, civilized. Rain don't whip and sun don't blind.
   1126598|00000000||But why poke your nose in there to start with?
   1125215|00000000||Hut next door - saw blood stains inside.
   1125198|00000000||So long.
   1125037|00000000||Farewell.
   1125187|00000000||This place - what is it?
   1125190|00000000||What is this place, exactly?
   1125192|00000000||A village. Plain to see.
   1126588|00000000||Abandoned huts is about all I see.
   1126590|00000000||Aye, it's only us now. Young folk're gone off to the city, seekin' work. And the old've all died. Ain't that right, Judd?
   1126592|00000000||Right as rain.
   1125167|00000000||Judd! Sharp, now! We've company!
   1126514|00000000||What's brought you to these parts, master? Lost your way?
   1126516|00000000||No. Looking for someone.
   1126518|00000000||Ahh…! Do tell! Perhaps we can help!
   1126520|00000000||Could say that.
   1126522|00000000||Oh no, master, better to stick to the high road 'round here! These're wild lands. Wild and dangerous!
   1125173|00000000||You again? Well, out with it, what brings you here?
   1093551|00000000||Witcher! My heartiest wishes for joy on your new life's path. You've chosen quite the fetchin' wench.
   1100085|00000000||Look, look, look, look! Munchkins playing cards!
   1100087|00000000||In the mood to lighten Geralt's purse?
   1100089|00000000||Geralt won't mind. He's wild about cards!
   1104490|00000000||Those ass ears suit you, friend. Hahaha!
   1109463|00000000||Who's stupid idea was it to make the loser wear these damned ears?
   1109465|00000000||Yours! Don't you remember?!
   1104492|00000000||Save your laughter. Mark my words, I'll soon win. Then we'll see who the ass ears suit best.
   1093550|00000000||Stay away. I must focus on the game.
   1093554|00000000||That witcher's an odd duck.
   1100193|00000000||As freaks tend to be.
   1100195|00000000||But so odd as to talk to themselves?
   1100197|00000000||True, that's a bit out o' sorts. But to his credit, he's a beautiful lass at his side.
   1093556|00000000||Ah, yes. Quite the feather in his cap. Had he a cap.
   1093552|00000000||Blasted gwent. Can't stand it. Soon as I start playing, I just can't stop.
   1100093|00000000||Perhaps you'd care to sit down to some gwent with us?
   1093496|00000000||Most certainly would! You needn't ask twice, midget.
   1100095|00000000||No need for insults.
   1109831|00000000||I'm sorry. I meant no offense.
   1109833|00000000||Were that true, you wouldn't 'ave called him a midget.
   1109835|00000000||I've apologized. What else would you have me do? Bring him flowers?
   1109837|00000000||I'd have you play, and stop talkin'.
   1109821|00000000||Apologies.
   1109820|00000000||I tell it like it is.
   1109823|00000000||It's no insult, it's the truth. He's a midget.
   1109825|00000000||Like I said, that's an insult.
   1109827|00000000||Would you call your chum a giant?
   1109829|00000000||Shut up. You playin' or not?
   1105316|00000000||Let us play, gentlefolk.
   1105318|00000000||What's your wager?
   1109810|00000000||Everything. The whole lot. I'm all in.
   1109812|00000000||Mh. I never knew you to be such a gambler.
   1109814|00000000||You shall see many new sides of me this night, my dear.
   1125056|00000000||Many large sides.
   1109816|00000000||Normally we play that the loser's got to wear the ass ears.
   1109818|00000000||I needn't care. I shan't lose.
   1108852|00000000||I think you look charming.
   1112640|00000000||Quite the lark, this gwent.
   1112642|00000000||Onward, to the next diversion!
   1093534|00000000||You lose, witcher! Hand over the wager. Everything!
   1115592|00000000||Ehrm, perhaps we could reach an arrangement…?
   1115594|00000000||No weaselin' out of this! Hand over the coin!
   1100120|00000000||What do we do now?
   1100122|00000000||Feel good? Losing somebody else's coin?
   1109801|00000000||I meant to win, give you the coin. I've no need for it in the grave.
   1109803|00000000||But you lost, so now I've gotta pay up.
   1093536|00000000||I say, he talking to himself? Roaring drunk already, that's it.
   1109805|00000000||We can't fleece a drunk. Have him don the cap, and we'll call it even.
   1126532|00000000||Just a minute. Bloke needs a lesson. I say he dons the cap and gives us five percent of the coin he has.
   1115596|00000000||Hear that?
   1093538|00000000||Agreed. Five percent is yours. And I shall wear the cap, never fear. A man must do what a man must do, and Vlodimir von Everec's a man among men!
   1100124|00000000||Hear that? So sloshed he thinks he's Vlodimir von Everec.
   1093540|00000000||Rogue's long dead, by my reckoning.
   1112317|00000000||Exactly.
   1100127|00000000||Haha - those ears! You look, uh… interesting.
   1118964|00000000||It'll be midnight soon. The capping will begin. In the barn.
   1118966|00000000||I must have some sort of last hurrah.
   1118968|00000000||Oh, but the capping! All the guests need to be present.
   1100173|00000000||To the witcher and his betrothed!
   1100175|00000000||Hear that, Shani? My betrothed. Know what that means?
   1100198|00000000||No. What?
   1100200|00000000||It means we should act as befits the betrothed.
   1115598|00000000||And what's that mean?
   1115600|00000000||I woo you, you resist, but it all ends as everyone knows it must.
   1115602|00000000||Ahh, the merriment! Good show indeed! Let's continue the ball!
   1093542|00000000||Time to drink. We are at a wedding!
   1100155|00000000||Aye, let's drink, my time's as short as you are, friends!
   1093530|00000000||You're tits up, mate. Slap those ass' ears on your ass' noggin!
   1093532|00000000||Such a shame. I'd already pictured you in those ears. Quite the interesting picture, too.
   1100104|00000000||I know of other ways to look interesting. I could show you…
   1109798|00000000||I'll think about it.
   1130707|00000000||Despite numerous warnings, Geralt ventured deep into Deadwight Wood, where he found the ruins of Castle Arnskrone. There he fought a tough battle against an ancient leshen and found the earthly remains of Walter Romilly, and with them the eccentric count's journal.<br>
   1130708|00000000||Part of the count's journal described his foul treatment of Anastasia von Bourmann, who he believed to have been marked by a leshen. It also made mention of coin stashed somewhere beneath the castle.<br>
   1130709|00000000||Deep within the castle's subterranean passages Geralt uncovered Count Romilly's dark secret and the source of his wealth. The bleak ruins also contained treasure, which the witcher found and kept.
   1130710|00000000||Search the ruins of Count Romilly's castle.
   1130711|00000000||Read Count Romilly's notes.

   1137349|f416959f||Ewald Borsodi
   1123486|00000000||I found the hearth huffer.
   1123488|00000000||Really? Where is he?
   1123490|00000000||Hm… misfortune befell him. Sad, really. Shan't be seeing him again.
   1106738|00000000||I found a stick by a tree.
   1127315|00000000||A stick in the woods? Quite the discovery.
   1107261|00000000||Don't laugh. I've cracked the case - chased by the mutt, the flame sniffer scampered up the tree, his heft snapping a branch.
   1106740|00000000||He survived the incident, no blood to be found… though no fire snorter, either.
   1112948|00000000||So you haven't actually found him.
   1112950|00000000||Not as such... but I'm close, I can smell it.
   1106750|00000000||No discoveries of note as yet.
   1107267|00000000||But I shan't give up. This witcher work suits me swimmingly.
   1106728|00000000||How goes the search?
   1106730|00000000||I've found the hearth huffer. Damned fine work, eh?
   1106732|00000000||Yes. Where is he?
   1110587|00000000||Buggered off. Doubt we'll see any more of him.
   1094033|00000000||The hound tore its chain off the wall. Underfed, it seems.
   1101798|00000000||Or else the ash licker really boiled the mutt's blood.
   1105959|00000000||Wonderful, my juicy pear. I shall continue my travails while you rest. Shan't be long now.
   1094231|00000000||Following some dog's trail? Not exactly how I imagined this wedding. Think I'll wait here.
   1100611|00000000||A broken branch. As if one too heavy sought to scamper up this tree.
   1101822|00000000||Seems our fire eater swallows a great deal more than fire.
   1127313|00000000||Or perhaps someone was merely gathering kindling? Ah, there is joy in this ferreting!
   1094035|00000000||A bone gnawed so clean I've only ever seen two like this. One in an anthill.
   1101806|00000000||The other when I caught a hen after not eating for a week.
   1094097|00000000||More dog tracks. This witcher business is a jest.
   1101808|00000000||I'm clearly on the right trail. Unless, I'm not…
   1094095|00000000||A dog made these tracks, true, but a small one. Yet judging by its house, Daemon is a hulk.
   1101814|00000000||But beggars can't choose their tracks… so I shall follow these.
   1094099|00000000||A spark spitter's cap, if I've ever seen one. As jesterly as they come.
   1101818|00000000||Chap must've lost it running from Daemon.
   1101820|00000000||Two conclusions, then - our magician is fat, and a coward.
   1094037|00000000||Its bowl is chipped?
   1101812|00000000||Tried to devour its bowl along with its supper? Daft mutt.

   1116505|00000000||Tee-hee. Give us a kiss!
   1116507|00000000||Gwent's nothin'! Prefer my wife's arse any day!
   1125345|00000000||You should try it!
   1127391|00000000||Give us a kiss, donkey-love! Tee-hee.
   1115932|00000000||Yes?
   1115934|00000000||What do you want, Geralt?
   1115936|00000000||Calm down.
   1115938|00000000||Hey, witcher!

   1056133|0b95e2d9||Sick Man
   1115509|00000000||Behold. Wars've started over uglier wenches. Well, raids've been undertaken, at least.
   1115511|00000000||True, she looks lovely. Let's go.
   1115513|00000000||Whoa, whoa, hold! Mean to go in… wearing that?
   1115515|00000000||What else?
   1115517|00000000||Have you seen how she's dressed? I'll not parade at that jewel's side in a rank tunic.
   1115519|00000000||You need a robe! One daren't attend a wedding in anything less!
   1115521|00000000||Don't happen to have a robe handy.
   1115523|00000000||What do you mean? What about that?
   1115549|00000000||Good idea.
   1115558|00000000||All in all… why not.
   1115560|00000000||Ah! That's the spirit!
   1105288|00000000||You see? Geralt can't hold a candle to me.
   1105294|00000000||You see? Geralt's been a pill, a nag. That all changes today.
   1108093|00000000||Dramatically, I'd say. He's never been very talkative, to start with.
   1105296|00000000||He's been a fool. But I shall make up for that now - will you marry me?
   1105298|00000000||Hah. A big step, but I will think about it. For now, we should simply enjoy my friend's wedding.
   1108123|00000000||We'll talk later. Let's go to this wedding. The sooner the ghost has his fun, the sooner this'll be over.
   1108125|00000000||Finally, something that's not utter tripe. We shall dance till the break of dawn!
   1108180|00000000||You get till midnight, and not a second longer.
   1108182|00000000||That's not enough. I shan't even get properly soused by midnight, let alone--
   1108184|00000000||Make an effort. I'm sure you'll manage. You get to frolic and carouse till midnight - that's our deal. Then there's the capping. Then you go back where you came from.
   1115587|00000000||So be it.
   1113673|00000000||This way, my strawberry.
   1113675|00000000||Aaaaah. Hello, world - I'm back.
   1113677|00000000||I'll be damned - a proper wedding. Overladen tables, plenty of worthy drinking companions… and a swarm of fair maids…
   1113680|00000000||But none compare to you, my dear rhubarb.
   1108157|00000000||Beware of the dog, Shani. Judging by the size of its house, the mutt must be big as a horse.
   1108159|00000000||Thanks for your concern, but the doghouse is empty.
   1108162|00000000||They let a man-eater like that run free? Have the wedding guests been warned? Seems we are indeed in for a cracking good time.
   1108168|00000000||Oh, what a lovely rowan! I remember making necklaces of the fruit when I was a child.
   1108170|00000000||Ah, the berries make for splendid hooch! Olgierd and I'd brew it in our teething years.
   1109368|00000000||I shall introduce you to the newlyweds now. Try to behave.
   1109370|00000000||For you, my rowan petal, I'd do anything.
   1108118|00000000||Let's go to this wedding.
   1108109|00000000||For example?
   1108120|00000000||What, for example?
   1108130|00000000||It would do you good to be more relaxed sometimes.
   1108132|00000000||Relaxed? So you think I'm uptight?
   1108134|00000000||What I mean is it would be nice from time to time if you could sit back and enjoy life, instead of going around solving everyone's problems.
   1108136|00000000||But what does-- Ugh, I don't understand.
   1108138|00000000||Of course you don't. You're as dense as year-old hardtack. Luckily, you've got me.
   1108091|00000000||May I please speak to Geralt for a moment?
   1108095|00000000||Whatever for? This evening is about my pleasure, not his.
   1108097|00000000||Just for a moment? Then you can jump right back in.
   1108100|00000000||Be quick. I'll not stand here doing naught. I'm to enjoy myself.
   1108102|00000000||Geralt, I'm about to introduce you to the newlyweds. Please make sure your friend doesn't embarrass me.
   1093297|00000000||I can't make him do anything. All that nonsense is his. Feel like an ass saying it.
   1108108|00000000||I liked some of that nonsense.
   1105290|00000000||Be assured - you'll like me even better when you come to know me more intimately.
   1108089|00000000||How intimately?
   1105292|00000000||Enough to get a sense of my assets, my dear. Trust me, they're nothing to scoff at.
   1105287|00000000||We must get to know each other better.
   1099202|00000000||May they draw and quarter me if I've ever seen a lovelier lass!
   1108087|00000000||Nothing left of you to draw and quarter, alas.
   1099204|00000000||Doe eyes! A swan's soft, supple neck! And a waist so slim you could grip it one-handed!
   1099208|00000000||You're actually quite amusing this way.
   1115573|00000000||Perfect fit. It feels tailor-made.
   1115575|00000000||Now for shoes. One must wear shoes to a wedding.
   1140043|00000000||Hm. And we must be neat…
   1115570|00000000||Ah, this'll do wonderfully.
   1115553|00000000||Oh, no. We're not gonna steal.
   1115555|00000000||Come, now. We're merely borrowing.
   1115548|00000000||Not about to steal.
   1140348|00000000||No sign of her yet. We need to wait.
   1140351|00000000||This is very romantic.
   1140353|00000000||Fuck off.
   1108046|00000000||Seen how you look at Shani. Treat her right, or you'll have me to reckon with.
   1108044|00000000||Witcher, try me mum's apple tart. It's divine. But stay away from the gingerbread. Didn't turn out, sadly.
   1108035|00000000||Wish you a rolling good time at our little celebration, witcher.
   1108037|00000000||I'm honored you graced our weddin' with your presence.
   1108856|00000000||The capping starts at midnight. Until then - enjoy yourself, go wild.
   1108854|00000000||You must have a splendid time - that's what matters. Make the most of it!
   1108858|00000000||What a wonderful wedding. It's clear the newlyweds' parents spared no expense.
   1099723|00000000||We've chewed the fat enough. Time's a-wastin'!
   1099725|00000000||Are you… expected elsewhere?
   1099727|00000000||Me? Hah! I simply cannot wait to sample your liquors and dance with the local matrons.
   1099729|00000000||Johnnus and I invited more than a few lovely maidens. Perhaps one of them will catch your eye.
   1109384|00000000||Ohh, that's for damn certain!
   1109386|00000000||And perhaps you will catch one of their--
   1109388|00000000||It'd be nice, certainly, but I shan't be terribly bothered if it's not the case. Come, let's drink!
   1099678|00000000||Let the revels begin.
   1099731|00000000||Aldona seems a curious choice for a bride. Did she come with a hefty dowry?
   1099733|00000000||I assure you, witcher, my choice had naught to do with coin.
   1109401|00000000||Johnnus' family is far better off than mine. They've a textile manufactory.
   1109403|00000000||It took a lot of convincing to get mother to agree to our, as some would have it, mésalliance.
   1109405|00000000||T-ah. You never told me. Whatever happened to "Fortune is of no import to me and my family?"
   1099735|00000000||It isn't. Johnnus told me the same - that your background doesn't bother him.
   1099737|00000000||Never does, not at love's first blossoming. But give it time, five years, and you'll find few things that don't bother you.
   1127098|00000000||I'm beginnin' to find what you say bothersome. I don't know where you're from, but in these parts it is rude to insult newlyweds at a weddin'.
   1127100|00000000||Insult? I'm merely warning you. Know a thing or two about life, you see.
   1112315|00000000||Hm. Geralt and his jests. He has a strange sense of humor.
   1127102|00000000||Very strange, I'd say.
   1099679|00000000||You get a hefty dowry with your bride?
   1099739|00000000||Tell me, Aldona, how is it you and my dear Shani know each other?
   1099741|00000000||We met in Oxenfurt. Both studied medicine at the Academy.
   1099743|00000000||Wondrous times.
   1099745|00000000||Over quickly, in my case, alas. My family couldn't afford to keep me there. I was forced to return home after one year.
   1099747|00000000||It's never too late to pursue an education, my dear. Your husband is certain to help you complete your studies, provide the necessary coin.
   1099749|00000000||I don't know. We've not talked about it.
   1099751|00000000||Come, Johnnus, surely you've not taken Aldona as a mere diversion for the alcove? You will help her, will you not?
   1127104|00000000||That is between me and her. You needn't butt in.
   1127106|00000000||But I'm not. I merely ask! See, I've come to love your wife like a sister. So I ask you as your brother-in-law: will you help her?
   1099753|00000000||I'm sure we'll discuss the matter.
   1115590|00000000||Hahahaha. That's my lad! You're a right decent chap, I knew it from the start!
   1109389|00000000||How do you know Shani?
   1099677|00000000||Why'd you choose this chap?
   1099681|00000000||Aren't you an extraordinary beauty, my dear.
   1109376|00000000||Why, thank you.
   1109378|00000000||You had your pick of gents, I'm sure.
   1099683|00000000||Where is this goin'?
   1099685|00000000||I'm attempting to discern why she choose you, Johnnus.
   1099687|00000000||Mean you don't approve of my wife's choice?
   1109380|00000000||I've no skin in this game. I ask out of pure curiosity.
   1127060|00000000||Well, rein it in. Or I shall have to explain my wife's choice to you hands on. Out of pure pleasure.
   1127062|00000000||Why so testy, friend? Have I insulted you? Merely told your wife she was a beautiful woman. Yet here I'm threatened instead of getting thanks. Have some manners.
   1109382|00000000||Geralt, that's enough. She simply fell in love. That's that. Johnnus, I'm sure my friend meant no offense.
   1121765|00000000||Once more, all the best in your new life.
   1121767|00000000||Thank you.
   1121770|00000000||It's us, now. Dearies, blessings rain down upon you.
   1121772|00000000||May you live in 'ealth and 'appiness. Harmony and love forever last betwixt you.
   1121774|00000000||Thank you, from the bottom of our 'earts.
   1121776|00000000||Now go, enjoy the feast.
   1121779|00000000||Our turn.
   1099670|00000000||My dear friend Aldona, and her chosen one, Johnnus.
   1099672|00000000||It's an honor. The sun shine brightly on this new path in your lives. I am Vlo--
   1109374|00000000||This is my friend of yesteryear - Geralt of Rivia.
   1099674|00000000||Yes, 'tis I, Geralt. A witcher. Heartfelt thanks for your hospitality. I adore weddings. The brides, especially - so fragrant, so tasty, I could--
   1099676|00000000||Righto. I'm sure we'll all have a splendid time.
   1118119|00000000||Time to say hello. Be nice, now.
   1118115|00000000||Come, time to meet and be greeted.
   1118117|00000000||I shan't stray a step from your side.
   1118130|00000000||Delighted you made the long journey to be here with us.
   1118132|00000000||Course we did. How could we not be here for our only niece?
   1118134|00000000||We'd 'ave trekked from Kovir if we'd had to. This is your special day, love.
   1109397|00000000||Can't get drunk that way. Come on - in you go. And remember - enjoy yourself.
   1109399|00000000||Needn't remind me of that.
   1093206|00000000||This the Borsodi brothers' auction house?
   1093208|00000000||Seems it.
   1095209|00000000||Private Kleiner. You're on duty - need I remind you? Fraternizin' with civilians is not allowed.
   1093318|00000000||You'd be smart to make an exception.
   1093324|00000000||Make an exception - that's the smart thing to do.
   1093326|00000000||Threats don't scare me. I've sworn to serve Redania, till death do us part. And I'll keep my oath - with a song on my lips!
   1093328|00000000||Careful. Bugger means it.
   1095230|00000000||Gaaaaude, Maaaater Redaaaaniaaaa, prooole fecuuuunda nooobiiiliiii!
   1106929|00000000||Wha--? Who do I spy! Geralt? Geralt of Rivia?
   1106931|00000000||In the flesh. How long's it been, Vimme? Usury still your passion and profession?
   1106933|00000000||I prefer the term "savin's and loan bankin'" - but all in all, aye, that's how my preference lies.
   1093338|00000000||What's all the fash, Corporal Vatslav? Are you squabblin' with my pal Geralt?
   1093340|00000000||Master Vivaldi, sir, your esteemed associate - he weren't invited… to the auction. And I've--
   1093342|00000000||But I ploughin' have been. And he's comin' with me. In you go, Geralt.
   1095234|00000000||But-- My orders--
   1095236|00000000||Fuck yer orders. Need I take this up with the sergeant? Hah! I thought not! Now, stand to attention! And shut yer geggy!
   1095239|00000000||Oh, the lads'll be rollin' back at the barracks.
   1095241|00000000||Shut it! Now march! Round you go! One! Two! One! Two!
   1093330|00000000||Who have we here! Geralt, the witcher of Rivia!
   1093332|00000000||Vimme Vivaldi, the banker from-- Actually, where are you from?
   1093334|00000000||Matters little, mate. Gold knows no boundaries.
   1093320|00000000||Gonna let that hold you back? Come on…
   1093322|00000000||Afraid you're outta luck. Order 76-CW-X also held that Lance Corporal Vatslav stick a broomstick up his arse.
   1095228|00000000||Kleiner! Need I remind you of the penalty for insulting a superior?!
   1093317|00000000||I'm sure we can work something out.
   1093292|00000000||Any of the owners home?
   1093300|00000000||Meanin' the one and sole owner - the esteemed Horst Borsodi? Aye, he is.
   1093302|00000000||Need to talk to him.
   1093304|00000000||Order 76-CW-X is clear - auction's only open to folk with invitations… writ out in their names, plain and simple.
   1093211|00000000||Want to talk to the owners.
   1093295|00000000||See you.
   1095224|00000000||Aye, farewell. Private Kleiner! Attehhhn-shun!
   1095226|00000000||Ugh…
   1093214|00000000||Farewell.
   1093213|00000000||Redanian soldiers guarding an auction house?
   1093232|00000000||Just curious - Redanian army regulars, right?
   1093234|00000000||Lance Corporal Vatslav reportin'! And this bloke's my subordinate, Private Kleiner.
   1093236|00000000||Careful you don't piss yourself out of excitement.
   1095213|00000000||You say somethin', soldier?!
   1093238|00000000||Not a thing.
   1095215|00000000||Shouldn't you be somewhere? There's a war on, you know.
   1095217|00000000||We was transferred here, all official. Written order 76-CW-X. Mission - guard the auction house. Priority - high, top, in fact.
   1095219|00000000||Borsodi fellow knows his way about the court. Helps the high-rankin' sell their war booty, heheh. Gets protection in return.
   1095221|00000000||Private Kleiner! That's confidential military information!
   1093210|00000000||Purpose of your visit?
    563535|5a32e0f6||Mercenary
   1125723|00000000||There a break-in at the auction house? That true?
   1125725|00000000||Horst claims no such thing occurred. That it were a security exercise.
   1125834|00000000||An exercise? With them carting corpses away after?
   1125836|00000000||I don't honestly know. And I don't aim to ask.
   1125727|00000000||Horst Borsodi's funeral yesterday.
   1125729|00000000||Aye, and?
   1125839|00000000||No one came.
   1125841|00000000||Did he have no kin?
   1125843|00000000||He had some, but there's a grim story to it all. Anyroad, Vivaldi's taken over the auction house.
   1125731|00000000||Vivaldi? Little weasel. Must've been a bargain he couldn't pass up.
   1125719|00000000||Have you heard? Auction house is under new management.
   1125721|00000000||The sign still says "Borsodi."
   1125827|00000000||Aye, but a different one. Ewald.
   1125829|00000000||What of Horst? Any news?
   1125831|00000000||Folk say it were a ticker tantrum. But the casket were closed for the burial. So, you know…
   1137785|00000000||What's this one want?
   1137787|00000000||A good bruising, looks like! At him, brothers!
   1137791|00000000||Busy spot, lots to do…
   1137779|00000000||Verily, I say unto you, lecherous halfling, that open the door you must!
   1137781|00000000||Fail to, and we'll torch your hut right thorough!
   1137783|00000000||So help us God, the Fire Eternal!
   1112670|00000000||Geralt entered the Oxenfurt sewers expecting to hunt down a hideous monster – so you can imagine his surprise when down one of those dank, slimy corridors he ran into Shani, an old and dear friend. Geralt and I had first met this extraordinary young woman years earlier, when she was just a coltish coed, but by this time she had grown into a dignified doctor and a fearless field medic for the Redanian Army.<br><br>This latter role had led her, and a unit of soldier escorts, to descend into the sewers. Their goal was to gather a sample of the venom spewed by the monstrosity squatting there. Geralt, a gentleman through and through, agreed to help her in her task.<br>
   1112671|00000000||Geralt's encounter with Vlodimir von Everec reminded him that he and Shani had once shared passionate (though passing) feelings for each other. He also became aware some remnant of these feelings was still lodged in his heart…<br>
   1112672|00000000||At times fate composes tales so shocking no poet would dare put his name to them, for fear his public would mock them as overly outlandish. Such was the case when Geralt and the ghost of Vlodimir von Everec shared a body for an evening and accompanied Shani to the wedding of Aldona, her friend from the Academy. Some might have let this unusual escort interfere with their enjoyment of the evening – but not Shani. Looking around at the tasteful wedding decorations, smelling the rich odor of berry-laden rowan – a plant near and dear to her heart, one which summoned up fond childhood memories – Shani felt the heedless abandon of her younger years return and, overjoyed, threw herself into the thick of the festivities.<br>
   1112673|00000000||One thing is certain – Shani was not bored by the company of Vlodimir von Everec, who showered her with professions of burning desire and swept her off her feet with his maniacal energy. Yet when the hour came for him to return to the netherworld, she breathed a sigh of relief, for now she could spend some time alone with Geralt, who was much more sensitive and predictable (though Vlod would probably just call him boring).<br>
   1112674|00000000||A pleasantly-begun evening blossomed into a night of rapture, then settled into a golden dawn on the shores of a lake, serenaded by nature's first awakening murmurs. Though Shani seemed delighted by this course of events, the morning air had put her in a reflexive mood. She parted ways with Geralt, explaining she had to think through what had just happened.<br>
   1137069|00000000||Fate decreed Shani would not linger long in her hometown of Oxenfurt. For as long as the war lasted, she was the Redanian army's to command, and her commander had decided to send her to Kaedwen, the conflict's eastern front. Before setting off she managed to inform Geralt about a certain Professor Shakeslock, who might be able to help with Gaunter O'Dimm. Geralt thanked his friend and they parted ways, hoping they would meet again, later or, quite preferably, sooner.

   1125365|00000000||Vow never to eat another bite of human flesh… and I'll let you live.
   1125367|00000000||Oh, I swear, swear it on dear Mother Melitele! On the Eternal Fire! On--
   1125369|00000000||Keep the gods out of it. Swear on your heads. Which I will take if you break your vow.
   1125371|00000000||A-aye. We swear.
   1126776|00000000||You live in the middle of nowhere. It's out of my way. But I'll be back. Better believe I'll be back.
   1126766|00000000||Never eat human flesh again, take a vow, and I'll let you live.
   1125353|00000000||Folk say we witchers have no feelings. It's a barefaced lie.
   1126796|00000000||Right now, I feel rage. And I can't wait to vent.
   1126767|00000000||Don't believe you. Death's what you deserve.
   1126757|00000000||Been to your larder. Meat-rich diet - that what you like?
   1126759|00000000||Master, not at all, 't'ain't like tha--
   1126761|00000000||Best hope not. Or you'll be next to get a hook through your neck.
   1126763|00000000||The wolves killed him! Him and the others. We but gather the bodies! That's the truth!
   1126765|00000000||We're old and frail, we've no strength to plough or sow. But we gotta eat. Have pity, master!
   1136471|00000000||Apparently, likely to find some small jade deposits north-east of Novigrad.
   1137166|00000000||Oughta try my luck there.
   1136473|00000000||Jade. Now to extract some.
   1136483|00000000||Deposit's too meager. Gotta find another.
   1136485|00000000||Not much jade here. Need to keep looking.
   1137412|00000000||Damn painite. Looks like I gotta try another merchant.
   1137410|00000000||No painite here. Need to ask someone else.
   1137414|00000000||Didn't have any painite, either. Try my luck with other traders, I guess.
   1136468|00000000||Painite's too rare to just find it lying around. Need to go to Novigrad, ask the right merchants.
   1139682|00000000||<i>The spider shall never lie down with the fly.</i><br>– Ofieri proverb<br><br>A similar saying could gain ground in our land concerning arachnomorphs and everything unable to flee them – meaning most every creature in the world. True, the tillers of the earth and fellers of trees need not fear them in their daily labors, for arachnomorphs, as distant, post-Conjunction cousins of common spiders, strongly prefer deep, dark caves and unfrequented sodden swamps.  Anyone who does come across them, however, had best hope his conscience is clear and his worldly affairs are in order, for his life shall soon end, as not even the fastest man in the world can outrun them and only a few witchers can hope to slay them. Even worse are the more aggressive and dangerous kind known as arachnomorph colossi, which are capable of devouring an entire ox in seconds.<br>
   1139696|00000000||Killing an arachnomorph is no easy task, but there are two approaches which stand a chance of succeeding. Due to the astonishing speed with which an arachnomorphs can move, there is no point in chasing it – better instead to choose an advantageous position and wait for it to strike. The beast will most often try a surprise attack, throwing at its prey a web which will leave the entangled victim barely able to counter blows, let alone strike ones of its own. One should thus strive to attack an arachnomorph when steps back to start weaving its web, seizing this moment of vulnerability before it is too late.<br><br>Arachnomorphs suffer the effects of most witcher Signs: they can be stunned with Aard or trapped with Yrden, and the Axii Sign can also be used to momentarily neutralize them.  A wise tactic is to attack them with a crossbow or bombs and coat one’s blade with insectoid oil.<br><br>One must be exceedingly careful when fighting an arachnomorph colossus – such a beast needs no time to weave a new web, having within its sacs a virtually limitless supply of silk. It can also jump great distances to pin its victim to the ground. Only the Yrden Sign can hope to slow it.

   1095375|00000000||Vimme, this is a banquet.
   1095377|00000000||Aye. And?
   1095379|00000000||I detest banquets. Vacuous conversation, food portions fit for a mouse, drinks that taste like piss…
   1095381|00000000||Ach, it won't all be bad. Let me introduce ye to some o' my most interesting associates.
   1095384|00000000||Old hen there's Countess Mignole. Wager ye'll have plenty to blather about with her… Prick in the corner's Hilbert. New coin, that one. Came intae a right fortune playin' gwent.

   1095389|00000000||Agh…
   1095198|00000000||Oh, awful! You're doing terribly. Remember, you can always give up.
   1137733|00000000||As I see it, you will never find me. Never.
   1095200|00000000||That's cheating!
   1095202|00000000||Which only ever makes the game more interesting. Hahahahahaha…
   1137735|00000000||Seek, Geralt, seek!
   1095204|00000000||Gotta be some mirror here you won't shatter.
   1095206|00000000||Haha, seek and ye shall find. Perhaps.
   1104324|00000000||Hm, wonder how you'll shatter a sheet of water…
   1108115|00000000||What is this place?
   1108117|00000000||Haha, you like it?
   1108770|00000000||Plenty more where it came from!
   1137742|00000000||Just remember - you must find me before time runs out.
   1108129|00000000||Really, Geralt - unable to resist a few shiny coins?
   1108772|00000000||I truly expected more of you.
   1108774|00000000||Especially since time is short.
   1108150|00000000||Monsters weren't part of the deal!
   1108152|00000000||My world, my rules.
   1108154|00000000||What is it about swords that turns men into utter fools when they see one for the taking?
   1108783|00000000||Through howling winds, pouring rain, with their life hanging by a thread…
   1108785|00000000||Which reminds me - time is running out.
   1108172|00000000||Mirror… so this is where you're hiding?
   1108186|00000000||Can't keep doing that forever!
   1108188|00000000||Care to wager on it?
   1108190|00000000||Do that all you want. I'll still get you.
   1108192|00000000||So you say, yet I wait and wait, and nothing… You've yet to find me.
   1108176|00000000||Damn you, O'Dimm!
   1108178|00000000||Hahahaha… Point for me.
   1108542|00000000||There was water here, once. Maybe there's a way to bring it back…
   1108544|00000000||Rushing water… behind this wall. Break down the wall, and the water'll rush through here…
   1110546|00000000||Children delight in me, elders take fright, fair maids rejoice and spin.
   1110548|00000000||Cry, and I weep, yawn, and I sleep, smile, and I too shall grin.
   1110550|00000000||Dammit, what are you?
   1110540|00000000||To all things and men I appertain, and yet by some am shunned and disdained.
   1110542|00000000||Fondle and ogle me till you're insane, but no blow can harm me, cause me pain.
   1110544|00000000||Hm. What could that be?
   1110520|00000000||Repeat the riddle!
   1110522|00000000||To all things and men I appertain, and yet by some am shunned and disdained.
   1110524|00000000||Fondle and ogle me till you're insane, but no blow can harm me, cause me pain.

   1121358|00000000||A family tomb.
   1121360|00000000||"To all I appertain, by some am shunned and disdained"… Could be "family," I guess.
   1121362|00000000||Wouldn't match much else in the riddle, though.
   1121370|00000000||Children delight in me, elders take fright, fair maids rejoice and spin.
   1121372|00000000||Children and young folk like swings. Could be scary to old folk, too…
   1121374|00000000||Doesn't fit the other verses, though.
   1121376|00000000||"Cry, and I weep, yawn, and I sleep, smile, and I too shall grin…"
   1123193|00000000||Hmm… Something that repeats all I do? Maybe… an echo?
   1121378|00000000||Echo…
   1121380|00000000||No dice. You can't possibly ogle an echo.
   1108174|00000000||Hahahaha, come now, you didn't expect it to be THAT easy, did you?
   1127262|00000000||Craft something for me, would you?
   1127218|00000000||Like you to enhance some gear for me.
   1130231|00000000||Northern Realms - like it here so far?
   1130233|00000000||Oh, yes! Never have I seen woodlands so expansive or skies with such colors brushed.
   1130251|00000000||Nordlings, however… peculiar they are. Tight-lipped, closed within.
   1130253|00000000||Hm.
   1130255|00000000||And bandits the high roads riddle. But on the horrid conflict this I blame.
   1127220|00000000||Liking it here in the Northern Realms?
   1127281|00000000||Thanks. So long.
   1127221|00000000||Farewell.
   1127217|00000000||Lemme see what you're peddling.
   1127260|00000000||Wouldn't mind a glance at what you got.
   1127290|00000000||The world's never-ending creation be praised.
   1127387|00000000||Now have I all I require.
   1127636|00000000||Sure about that?
   1130120|00000000||My running costs to cover small sums will suffice. And no more rare stones do I need.
   1130122|00000000||Almost too good to be true.
   1130124|00000000||A cask of wine from the homeland I have. Our mutual success we should toast.

   1128744|00000000||Otto told Geralt his apprentice, Folkert, had not returned from an herb-gathering excursion to the Deadwight Wood. Though this was not at all on Geralt's way, he decided to help the desperate herbalist. Something tells me this was not merely on account of the reward on offer – though those knowing only Geralt's surface from ballads and rumors might find this hard to believe, deep down, he was really a softy.<br>
   1128745|00000000||Geralt did not in fact find Folkert, but witness testimony allowed him to establish the halfling's fate. The young halfling had so badly wanted to bring his master the herbs that he had ventured deep into the woods, braving the wolves that hunted there. Though no body ever was found, it is not hard to guess what had become of the poor lad.
   1128746|00000000||Geralt found Folkert -- carefully gutted and salted and hanging in a larder belonging to an elderly couple living near the woods. The couple swore they hadn't killed the young halfling, but the witcher did not see that this absolved them of their crime and reached for his sword.
   1128747|00000000||Geralt found Folkert -- carefully gutted and salted and hanging in a larder belonging to an elderly couple living near the woods. The couple swore they hadn't killed the young halfling and had been forced into cannibalism by famine. Though Geralt condemned their actions, he decided punishing cannibals was not his duty and walked away.
   1128800|00000000||"Witcher" has become a synonym for "monster slayer" in many minds. While accurate as far as it goes, this does not encompass the whole truth, for witchers take on a broad variety of other tasks besides the slaying of monsters. For example, they sometimes use their superhuman senses to find missing persons. Such a lost individual was the subject of the notice hung by a certain Otto Bamber, an herbalist residing near Oxenfurt.<br>
   1127949|00000000||Talk to the herbalist.
   1127950|00000000||Look for Folkert's tracks in the Deadwight Wood using your Witcher Senses.
   1127958|00000000||Ask the inhabitants of the village about Folkert.
   1128742|00000000||Report back to the herbalist.
   1128743|00000000||Interrogate the peasant couple.
   1137926|00000000||Kill the peasants.
   1137749|00000000||Follow the scent to its source using your Witcher Senses.
   1130224|00000000||Search the room.
   1130223|00000000||Follow the blood track.

   1139679|00000000||<i>There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in philosophy.</i><br> - Bartolomeo Darez, after trying to contact creatures from another plane and landing in an insane asylum.<br><br>The Caretaker served with the indifference of a golem, and proved as fierce in battle as it was diligent in its labors. It felt no pain – in fact, each blow it received seemed to give it strength, as did each blow it landed on Geralt with the spade it wielded as a weapon. What is more, the Caretaker was able to summon powerful spirits from the graves it had dug and could heal itself by absorbing them. The witcher had a hard time evading the devastating strikes of its weapon, and his only chance at wounding the creature came when it would stick its spade in the ground to draw on otherworldly energy in an attempt to petrify its foes with fright.<br><br>
   1139736|00000000||The being known as the Caretaker had been summoned to the von Everec estate from another realm, making "demon" its most accurate designation. The Caretaker had been forced into servitude by magic. Its tasks - to care for the house and protect it from intruders. It performed these pedantically, tending the flowers, repairing the fences, tidying the yard… and murdering all intruders who set foot on the grounds, then burying their corpses in neat rows on untended land just beyond the manor garden's bounds.
   1139678|00000000||The Caretaker
   1115080|00000000||All right. Let's go. Just a stone's throw away.
   1115076|00000000||All right. Let's go.
   1098447|00000000||Mhm. Herbalist's hut near Oxenfurt. Go there, ask for yarrow extract. Can you remember that?
   1098449|00000000||Hmm… I think I can. See you there soon.
   1115081|00000000||Not headed in that direction just yet. tam Meet you there later.
   1115077|00000000||No. Not headed there just yet.
   1115073|00000000||Yeah. Herbalist, has a hut near Oxenfurt. Go there, ask for yarrow extract.
   1115075|00000000||I shall do just that. Hm. Wouldn't happen to be goin' there yourself, would you? We might go together.
   1098437|00000000||Yeah.
   1098451|00000000||Sorry. Can't say yet.
   1098453|00000000||You're forgiven. Take your time, I shall await word.
   1098438|00000000||Don't know yet.
   1098441|00000000||Greetin's. How's it? Got some form of employ for me?
   1104989|00000000||I've got to admit I've got itchy fingers, itchy fingers…
   1104991|00000000||Chattin's a waste of time, Geralt. Let's get to work.
   1128240|00000000||Ugh! Dammit…
   1115491|00000000||Ooh, that looks just a little too creepy for me…
   1115493|00000000||Don't have to come if you don't want. Wait here.
   1115495|00000000||I like that idea.
   1115497|00000000||If there's any trouble, just yell.
   1115485|00000000||The tome was spot on. This is impressive.
   1115487|00000000||Yeah. Too bad it's falling apart.
   1115489|00000000||The family hit on hard times. No coin to splurge on such luxuries.
   1108592|00000000||Change your mind?
   1112292|00000000||Nope. Just about to go in.
   1105097|00000000||Never seen this side of you.
   1108199|00000000||What side is that?
   1108201|00000000||How do I put this… your romantic side? Used to seeing you surrounded by bandages and medicine vials. Often covered in blood.
   1108203|00000000||That's because you usually come round while I'm at work. Off-duty, now, waiting for you, weaving a garland for the wedding.
   1108385|00000000||Didn't know you were getting married.
   1108387|00000000||Not mine, silly. My friend's.
   1108389|00000000||This garland's not for me.
   1108204|00000000||Never mentioned you were getting married.
   1129229|00000000||Be glad to.
   1108410|00000000||Sure, why not.
   1108412|00000000||Wonderful. So… it's a date.
   1115481|00000000||Shall we?
   1115483|00000000||Let's go.
   1126555|00000000||Remember to bring the censer?
   1126557|00000000||Of course. Some soldiers nearly caught me slipping it into my satchel.
   1126560|00000000||Wasn't sure what you needed it for, so I also took a mix of amber, aniseed and juniper. All rather smoky when lit.
   1126562|00000000||Thanks. Might come in handy.
   1108374|00000000||Nimble hands you got there.
   1108376|00000000||I should hope so. I'm a surgeon.
   1108378|00000000||Think I prefer you using them this way.
   1108380|00000000||Less blood?
   1108382|00000000||More beauty.
   1108384|00000000||Hm. There's a beauty to surgery, I assure you.
   1108391|00000000||I know. Just… out here, in this landscape, it does more for me than in an operating room.
   1108206|00000000||It's coming out nicely.
   1108205|00000000||A wedding? Whose?
   1108393|00000000||A wedding? Whose?
   1108395|00000000||A dear friend's - from the academy.
   1108397|00000000||Speaking of which… would you go with me?
   1129231|00000000||That was your notice?
   1129234|00000000||Wait, wait - that was your notice?
   1129236|00000000||What notice?
   1129238|00000000||The one posted by the Seven Cats.
   1129245|00000000||Need a beau to accompany me to a friend's wedding... If any intelligent, amusing, handsome, none too old nor none too young man owning at least one decent looking frock…
   1129240|00000000||Hahaha! No, that's not mine.
   1129242|00000000||So, will you go with me or not?
   1129230|00000000||Can't.
   1108414|00000000||Love to, I would - but this Olgierd, and Master Mirror, business…
   1108416|00000000||Enough said. Won't try to talk you into it.
   1108588|00000000||Be careful. Please.
   1108590|00000000||Oh, I will be. Wouldn't want to give you even more work .
   1130897|00000000||The Ofieri runewright got down to work, but announced at once that more advanced runes or glyphs would require special materials. Jade, it seems, is a necessary part of advanced runewrighting. Since Geralt was interested in enchanted goods of the better sort, he decided to look around for a hunk of this element.<br>
   1130898|00000000||Finding large quantities of jade was not easy, but when the witcher set his mind to it, he could even find a dove in a blizzard. Soon enough the Ofieri runewright had what he desired.
   1130899|00000000||Acquire a hunk of jade for the Ofieri runewright.
   1130903|00000000||Take the hunk of jade to the Ofieri runewright.

   1112111|00000000||Your gray mane really does suit you.
   1112114|00000000||I met a colleague of yours once. Berembir, I believe his name was.
   1112117|00000000||Are forktails truly as dangerous as folk contend?
   1112120|00000000||Should I buy it or not? Can't seem to make up my mind.
   1112123|00000000||Hang on. Hullo there. Are you Geralt, Geralt of Rivia? I heard a bard sing your praises not long past.
   1113608|00000000||Plough it. Plough it all.
   1113614|00000000||Guests, fish and bloomers - all stink after three days. Hahahahahahah!

   1093128|00000000||Strange. Drowners' bodies are covered in slime.
   1096707|00000000||Hm, must've run into the beast, just like the soldiers.
   1093130|00000000||We have to find its lair. Need to hurry.
   1093134|00000000||Beginning to doubt this is a zeugl…
   1097337|00000000||What else is that large and lives in sewers?
   1097339|00000000||Dunno… Maybe a giant toad?
   1097341|00000000||Mhm. Right.
   1093136|00000000||Hear that? Think that's the beast.
   1097347|00000000||The noise seems to be coming from the other side of this wall.
   1104853|00000000||Body's covered in the same strange slime.
   1104862|00000000||Geralt, wait! We haven't finished yet!
   1104913|00000000||Don't leave me here!
   1107771|00000000||A woman. Must've come here hoping to find her prince.
   1107773|00000000||Another unfortunate romantic. Came to lift a prince's curse, found a hideous death instead.
   1093124|00000000||When did you get pressed into service?
   1101936|00000000||As soon as war broke out.
   1101938|00000000||First they had me patching up folk at the Battle of Dorian, then at Vizima, and finally in Velen.
   1101940|00000000||Been to those battlefields. Must've been tough.
   1101942|00000000||It's war. Severed limbs, blood and guts.
   1101944|00000000||Remember, I learned how to operate under Milo "Rusty" Vanderbeck, at the Battle of Brenna.
   1101946|00000000||Graduates of his school can handle anything.
   1097300|00000000||Legend going around about this monster being a prince turned into a toad. A curse or something.
   1097302|00000000||I've heard. A lot of women have fallen for it.
   1097304|00000000||I find out who started that rumor? I'll strangle them.
   1097306|00000000||So, don't believe it?
   1097308|00000000||I studied medicine, not literature. I stopped believing in fairytales long ago.
   1119023|00000000||Careful. Monster might still be here.
   1119025|00000000||Got the key.
   1119167|00000000||Good, let's get going.
   1119037|00000000||Geralt! Are you all right?
   1119169|00000000||I'm fine!
   1119171|00000000||I can't get down this way! I'll look for something else!
   1119173|00000000||Be careful!
   1119038|00000000||*Sniff sniff* Hm, odd smell. Blend of alcohol, blood and monster stench. Must've come through here.
   1119040|00000000||Monster left via this tunnel.
   1120871|00000000||We'll never make it through there. Need to find another way.
   1119042|00000000||Can't say I envy him. Horrible way to die.
   1119058|00000000||Dead drowners everywhere.
   1119187|00000000||Strange. Seemed the monster tolerated them.
   1119189|00000000||Long as they don't get too close, I guess.
   1119191|00000000||Lair's gotta be nearby.
   1119060|00000000||Shani, watch out!
   1120823|00000000||Loads of slime here. Enough for your sample?
   1120893|00000000||It'd be more than enough if it wasn't contaminated.
   1120825|00000000||Shani, can you get your sample here?
   1120895|00000000||Sure. Along with a bunch of dirt, rubble, and drowner droppings.
   1120897|00000000||I need a clean sample. From the lair - that'd be best.
   1119021|00000000||Grating's badly bent. Something large struck it, with a lot of momentum.
   1119163|00000000||I shut it as I fled. The monster must've slammed into it.
   1119165|00000000||Glad it held up. Though now we need to find a way around it.
   1128482|00000000||Is it worth searching outside?
   1128484|00000000||Actually, just hoping the monster's blow weakened one of the walls.
   1104864|00000000||Oh, I was worried you'd gone off on your own.
   1104859|00000000||Geralt! This way!
   1104857|00000000||Monster must've emerged from this tunnel. Then fled the same way.
   1104855|00000000||Swelling on much of the body. Blows from a large, blunt object.

   1137127|00000000||While at the Borsodis' auction, Geralt bid a not insignificant sum on a strange figurine. Why, you ask? Perhaps it was that famed witcher's intuition, for after dismantling the figurine Geralt found he had also become the owner of a letter and a heavy, ornate key...<br>
   1137128|00000000||The letter, he discovered, was Count Romilly's last will and testament. From it he learned treasure might be hidden in Arnskrone Castle.<br>
   1137129|00000000||Geralt set off to the eerie ruins of Arnskrone Castle, the Romilly family's one-time home, and found a chest full of treasure in its crumbling underground passages.

   1137965|00000000||You'll hang for this! All of you!
   1137957|00000000||They're in the vault! Locked themselves in!
   1138144|00000000||Geralt's auction-going experience ended in catastrophe. Not only was he summarily tossed out on his venerable witcher rear end, he also failed to learn anything about Maximilian's House. Then, while pondering his next step, he was approached by a mysterious stranger. This man did not say who he was, where he was from, how he knew of the witcher or how he had found him. All he would reveal was that he could help Geralt gain access to the auction house vault – without asking the owner's permission. The stranger proposed they meet somewhere more secluded so he might explain his plan in greater detail.<br>
   1138145|00000000||The mysterious man was planning to break into and rob the auction house. He claimed the subject of Olgierd's wish – Maximilian's House – was to  be found inside its vault. Though the witcher usually refused to engage in criminal activities, he came to the conclusion he had no choice but to agree to work with this secretive gentleman.<br>
   1138146|00000000||During the break-in the mysterious stranger was revealed to be none other than Horst Borsodi's brother, Ewald, who had disappeared years earlier. This family reunion was no joyous event, however. Rather than grasp hands and pat shoulders, the brothers immediately reached for each other's throats.<br>

   1127422|00000000||For if you go to Dol Blathanna, you're gonna meet some damned fools there! Hahaha!
   1136398|00000000||When Geralt later told me the story which began at the Seven Cats Inn notice board, he mentioned he had felt drawn to that place, as if some strange, undefined force wanted him to appear there on that day and at that time. I didn’t give this remark a second thought until I heard the tale to its conclusion, and realized its beginning had been no accident...<br>
   1136404|00000000||As you might have guessed, what looked like a run-of-the-mill monster hunt, the kind Geralt had already completed countless times, turned out to be but the very tip of a very large iceberg. The first icy underwater hunk exposed itself when Geralt quite unexpectedly encountered our old friend Shani, an Oxenfurt medic, in the sewers during his hunt for the toad monster. He promised to visit her as soon as he took care of his task, and kept his promise – but not before going on quite the detour.<br><br>When Olgierd mentioned rumors floating around that the sewer monster was an enchanted prince, the thought never even occurred to Geralt to grant them any credence. When he finally found and slew the beast, he learned the error of this disbelief. Once slaughtered, the toad revealed itself to be, as rumored, a prince. Geralt was dumbstruck – partly by this surprise twist, I’m sure, but mostly by the poisonous gasses that had escaped from the toad’s body and still filled the air. He was thus in no state to resist the unit of heavily armed men led by a mage which suddenly appeared and captured him.<br><br>When he next awoke, he was on a ship, imprisoned with a strange man who informed him they were bound for Ofier. There Geralt was to be executed for the crime of killing the Ofieri crown prince. Geralt was wracking his brain for a way to jump out of this pot of trouble, when, suddenly, out of the shadows came Gaunter O’Dimm, a merchant Geralt had met earlier on his path, with an offer of help. The merchant charged a high price for his assistance: he left his mark on Geralt’s face and forced him to make an open-ended promise of repayment. And then… then a terrible storm broke out, flinging the ship against the rocks.<br><br>Geralt made it out of the resulting chaos unscathed and went to meet O’Dimm. The merchant asked him to carry out three wishes for the man who'd sent him after the toad, Olgierd von Everec. Willing or not, Geralt agreed, and the two set off together to the Garin estate. Once there, they discovered the manor was on fire. The witcher decided to see what was afoot.<br>
   1136406|00000000||Near the burning manor two of Olgierd’s men were setting up the execution of a third. Geralt decided to intervene. As soon as he did, Olgierd emerged from the manor – and did not stand idly while Geralt interfered with his orders. Instead he engaged Geralt in unrestrained combat, during which the witcher sliced off his head. This proved but a temporary setback for Olgierd, who simply placed his decapitated head back on the bloody stump of his neck. It then became crystal clear Geralt was dealing with no mere mortal.<br><br>Soon thereafter Master Mirror appeared and introduced Geralt to Olgierd, explaining the witcher would, as his assistant, carry out Olgierd’s three wishes. This turn of events did not please Olgierd one bit, but he clearly had no choice but to agree and tell Geralt his wishes. For his first, he demanded Geralt bring him the house of Maximillian Borsodi, and for the second, he asked Geralt to show his brother, Vlodimir von Everec, the time of his life. Geralt then turned his attentions to these labors…<br>
   1136407|00000000||Near the burning manor two of Olgierd’s men were setting up the execution of a third. When Geralt asked what the poor fellow was accused of, Olgierd emerged from the manor. They had barely begun to discuss the matter when a bereaved young woman thrust a sword into his back, blaming him for the death of her father. This grave – deadly, it would seem – wound did not bother Olgierd one bit. With the blade still stuck in his guts, he began to calmly explain to the young woman that he was not responsible for her daddy’s death.

Geralt then turned his attentions to these labors…<br>
   1137369|00000000||And it began like this: One day Geralt arrived at the Seven Cats Inn in search of his next contract. He perused the notices hanging there, yet found none to be of much interest, and was about to go on his way when a man came to nail a new parchment to the board. The notice announced a certain Olgierd von Everec, residing in the nearby Garin Estate, was looking for someone to kill a dangerous monster lurking in the Oxenfurt sewers. “Sounds like a job for me,” thought Geralt, and he set off to see this Olgierd and learn more about the contract. Little did he know this was to be the beginning of a great adventure, one filled with both delightful diversions and deadly dangers…<br>

   1137152|00000000||Quinto gave proof his reputation was well-deserved: he opened the cage in which the group of mercenaries led by Hans of Cidaris held him using only a fish bone. After this feat, the witcher had no doubt Quinto was the man to fill the gap in his break-in crew.<br>
   1137153|00000000||Quinto demonstrated the craftsmanship of a true artist by tickling open the auction house vault doors in the blink of an eye. He also demonstrated the rotten cynicism of a true lowlife by displaying not one speck of loyalty to his companions. In the fight which took place in the auction house's basement, he stood against the witcher – and paid for this mistake with his life.
   1137636|00000000||Geralt has taken on a mad assortment of tasks in his life, many of which strayed far beyond his core trade of monster hunting. Recruiting a team to break into the vault in the Borsodis' Auction House, however, stood out as atypical even against this motley backdrop. One of the shady characters the witcher was told would make a good candidate was Quinto, the most famed safecracker north of the Yaruga.<br>
   1137643|00000000||Quinto demonstrated the craftsmanship of a true artist by tickling open the auction house vault doors in the blink of an eye. It soon seemed this would be his last display of criminal mastery, however, for afterwards he agreed to Horst Borsodi's offer of honest employment as a security specialist. How long he stayed on the right side of the law remains unknown – for neither I nor the witcher ever heard tale of him again.

   1127844|00000000||Blisterin' buckthorn, I thought I was done for! Me hut's always open to you.
   1137993|00000000||Horst Borsodi, owner of the most famous auction house in all the North, was a snob and a buffoon. He looked down his nose at Geralt from the very moment they met, and when he heard what had brought the witcher to him, he had his men toss him out and beat him. To say their relationship got started off on the wrong foot would thus be putting it very lightly indeed...<br>
   1137994|00000000||It came as no surprise, then, when Geralt chose to stand by his partner, Ewald, in the final showdown between the two brothers. With their strength combined, they defeated Horst's hired muscle. A few moments later, Ewald killed his hated brother in a spectacularly cruel fashion. It was later said none walked behind the once rich and mighty Horst Borsodi's casket and none shed a tear over his grave...
   1137995|00000000||Nevertheless, when the Borsodi brothers faced off in a final showdown, Geralt chose to stand by Horst. He never revealed why he made this decision – perhaps he considered a pompous buffoon less of an evil than a bloodthirsty cheat, which is what his erstwhile partner, Ewald, had proven to be. With Geralt's support, Horst managed to defeat Ewald. He repaid the witcher for this by giving him the ornamented box known as Maximilian's House.

   1100205|00000000||Don't like this at all.
   1100255|00000000||Uh, all seems a little shady. Your help, your pact with Olgierd, his three… requests…
   1100257|00000000||Think it over. I agree, you've no a priori reason to trust me.
   1100259|00000000||But as it happens, I was in the right place at the right time to help you. And it's also the case that the same man has wronged us both. To my mind those are reasons to work together.

   1100263|00000000||Come with me to see Olgierd. You shall see he's a vile, dishonorable man who treats the lives of all folk like playthings.

   1098714|00000000||I knew you'd come.

   1098722|00000000||Humans, elves, dwarves… all races. You really must explain that to me… one day.
   1098724|00000000||As for the here and now - tell me, how'd you manage with the Ofieris?
   1098767|00000000||Thanks for your help, really. but you could've chosen more conventional means. Given me the key to my cell, for instance.
   1098769|00000000||Oh my, far too simple. I dislike simple solutions. Do you like them?
   1098974|00000000||Doubt we're here to talk about my preferences.
   1098976|00000000||True. I'd much rather tell you about an individual of interest to us both.
   1106957|00000000||I was counting on more conventional help.
   1099004|00000000||You appeared out of nowhere, disappeared just as mysteriously, summoned a storm… Lemme guess - you're a mage.
   1099006|00000000||Please, no. I cannot stand spells.
   1099032|00000000||Childish hocus-pocus, it's just not interesting. What I find fascinating are true tales of true human lives. Like the one I shall tell you now.
   1106958|00000000||You summoned that storm? You a mage?
   1107040|00000000||Mansion's on fire. Didn't you notice?
   1106956|00000000||You didn't help me. Storm did.
   1098760|00000000||Well, can't say I remember you helping me that much. Storm broke out, ship smashed into some rocks.
   1098762|00000000||Is that what you believe? You're more a die-hard rationalist than I thought.
   1098764|00000000||Hm. So it's not gratitude that's brought you here. Which must mean curiosity's done the job. Mm, I adore that trait. It gives birth to so many fascinating tales.
   1098779|00000000||And the tale you so clearly want to tell me - what's that about?
   1098781|00000000||It's about a man worse than most. A vulgar, despicable man with a heart of stone. A man who refuses to pay his debts.
   1099028|00000000||Really think this'll interest me? Any reason why?
   1099030|00000000||He's wronged you as well. His name is Olgierd von Everec.
   1099160|00000000||What'd he do to you?
   1100153|00000000||Before I reveal this, I'd like to make one thing very clear.
   1099033|00000000||What'd Olgierd do to get on your shit list?
   1099173|00000000||Don't know why he's on your shit list, but I've got no quarrel with him.
   1099177|00000000||I believe you do, but have yet to realize it.
   1099035|00000000||Don't have a thing against Olgierd.
   1099034|00000000||How do you know he wronged me?
   1099162|00000000||How'd you know we'd met? And that I'm not exactly thrilled with him now?
   1099165|00000000||Please, Geralt. I knew the Ofieri had captured you - was I not to know how this had come to pass?
   1099175|00000000||Olgierd von Everec did willfully and maliciously conspire to cause you to kill a man who might have been cured. Had I not intervened, you would have lost your head for this.
   1099197|00000000||Do you know why he did it? Because he's a degenerate monster in human flesh who feeds on the pain and suffering of others.
   1099210|00000000||Well, you clearly don't like him. What'd he do to you?
   1099212|00000000||He and I made a pact. A pact under which I called on my many talents and associates to give him what he desired.
   1099304|00000000||And now the time's come to pay, yet he shirks his obligation.
   1099306|00000000||Need me to collect a debt? I'm not some hired muscle.
   1099308|00000000||Muscle is not what this requires. It needs a soul intelligent and clever, an individual who fears no dare. Someone like you.
   1099310|00000000||Pure flattery, that.
   1099312|00000000||Of course it is! After all, I am a traveling merchant. But make no mistake, I've many interesting wares on offer.
   1099314|00000000||Wares like…?
   1099316|00000000||Surfeit, abundance for the body and soul. You will lack neither food nor drink. As a witcher you might desire weapons supreme - I can offer you those you've dreamt of.
   1130016|00000000||Your body - agile as never before. Your mind - faster than lightning. Romantic prowess to charm all womankind. But above all I offer a great and true adventure, an experience like no other, the fate of only the chosen few.
   1130018|00000000||Sure sounds generous. And all that for my help with one small matter? Won't want anything else from me?
   1130024|00000000||Just one. Honesty.
   1099319|00000000||Olgierd's debt - how much is it?
   1099689|00000000||Hm. How much does he owe you?
   1099691|00000000||Gentlemen don't discuss coin.
   1100049|00000000||Need to know the details if you want me to get my hands dirty. How much? A million crowns? Two million?
   1100102|00000000||I'm no usurer to lend coin for interest.
   1100202|00000000||No, what Olgierd owes me is far more personal than shiny things that clink.
   1100204|00000000||As much as I regret it, I can say no more. I must respect his privacy.
   1099333|00000000||What have you done for Olgierd?
   1099381|00000000||What'd you do for Olgierd? Break him out of a cell, too?
   1099657|00000000||In some sense, yes. I remember that day quite well… There was a light drizzle, yet the cold tore right through you.
   1099665|00000000||Olgierd appeared at the break of dawn - gaunt as a rail, his shirt moth-eaten. Seemed to have naught but the sword at his side. It quite pained me to look at him.
   1099659|00000000||He asked for help, and help I gave. Made him a rich man, successful, esteemed. He is who he is today thanks only to me.
   1099661|00000000||Yet afterwards he turned his back, shunned me. Sends me off when I dare ask for payment - even sicced his hounds on me once.
   1099667|00000000||He's thus left me no option but to invoke the terms of our pact. And that is where you come in.
   1112506|00000000||Rather not get involved.
   1112508|00000000||Know what? This business, it's between you two. Rather not get involved.
   1112510|00000000||Before you decide, please hear me out. You shall see Olgierd is a vile man.
   1112512|00000000||Or, as they say in the west: a real son of a whore.
   1099317|00000000||What would I have to do?
   1130004|00000000||What about you? Call yourself a man of many talents - can't you take care of this?
   1130006|00000000||Therein lies the catch. Our pact states that before I can collect my due, I must yet fulfill three wishes for von Everec.
   1130008|00000000||But I cannot fulfill them myself, directly, making use instead of a… hmm… how shall I put it… a proxy.
   1130010|00000000||Mhm. So what you need's a sucker.
   1130012|00000000||What I need is an ally. And something tells me I shall find none better than you.
   1099335|00000000||What do you expect me to do?
   1099337|00000000||To start with, join me in paying von Everec a visit. Then, well… then we shall improvise.
   1130085|00000000||I believe, however, that all will end well. And once it does, we three shall meet and thank one another for the voyage we shared.
   1099339|00000000||Right. Specifics, now. Thought Olgierd had three wishes… requests… whatever.
   1099341|00000000||He does. He may ask three things of us. Yet we won't know what they are until we see him.
   1107042|00000000||Love to continue this chat, but something's on fire over there.
   1107044|00000000||So?
   1107046|00000000||Going over there. Maybe I can help.
   1107051|00000000||Ah, at least twenty pairs of hands there already. One more pair of witcher's mitts will make no difference, I assure you.
   1107053|00000000||Instead, why not stay and tell me how things went on the ship?
   1106992|00000000||Must say I'm surprised.
   1106994|00000000||By what?
   1106996|00000000||We were to meet at the crossroads, yet you show up here.
   1106998|00000000||Frankly, I was afraid you'd give me another memento.
   1107000|00000000||Hm. Interesting. I helped you find Yennefer, then I made possible your escape, so you ought to feel grateful. Even the worst scum feel an inner compunction to repay their "debts of gratitude" - but not you.
   1107002|00000000||I was subjected to mutations. Stripped me of all kinds of human compunctions.
   1107004|00000000||Hm. Interesting bit of information. We shall have to discuss it at length later.
   1107006|00000000||For now, you must tell me how you managed with the Ofieris.
   1112520|00000000||Sorry, have to find yourself someone else. I'm not about to help you.
   1127891|00000000||Don't be so hasty to decide. Olgierd von Everec is a truly base and vile man.
   1127964|00000000||Go to him, see for yourself.
   1127966|00000000||Just what do you think I'll see?
   1127968|00000000||All you need to. Things that will make you change your mind - I guarantee it. Besides which, help me in this, and I shall rid you of that unsavory mark. Not to mention all the other rewards that could be yours…
   1127970|00000000||Go. I shall join you later.
   1112518|00000000||Nope. Not about to help.
   1099342|00000000||All right. So be it. I'll help.
   1100338|00000000||Fine. I'll go see Olgierd with you, but no promises.
   1127953|00000000||That is all I ask.
   1127955|00000000||Now remove the damn mark.
   1129996|00000000||Naturally. Just as soon as you complete your task.
   1127935|00000000||Go on. You'll not regret it.
   1127937|00000000||What about you?
   1127939|00000000||I… I prefer to follow, remain in the shadows.
   1127929|00000000||Go, you will not regret it. We shall meet there. I've a matter to attend to along the way.
   1127931|00000000||Another debt to collect?
   1127933|00000000||Perhaps.
   1141150|00000000||<i>Quite often a wraith is tied to an object, something it clung to during life, or a location, such as its place of death. In either case, we are dealing with the same causal agent: a strong emotional tie from which the wraith draws strength.</i><br> – Inigo Swann, “Beyond the Natural World.”<br><br>While wandering the von Everecs’ abandoned estate, Geralt came into contact with a woman’s wraith haunting the house. The restless spirit had mastery over the house’s furnishings and in particular over the paintings hanging from its walls. It moved freely between their canvasses, entering one and exiting through another. At first it tried to scare Geralt into giving up his search, then, when it was clear this strategy would not work, it attacked him directly.<br><br>Geralt’s battle against the wraith proved very difficult, for it was fueled by rage and launched its attacks with heated aggression. Geralt was forced to move with lightning speed in order to parry its blows, without time to take a breath or launch an attack of his own. What’s more, the wraith had created a bond with the paintings around it and, until the witcher severed this tie, it would continually regain any lost strength.<br><br>The key to victory over the Wraith from the Painting was to focus on parrying its blows and only attack sporadically, at exactly the right moments. Any attempt to attack in a flurry was always punished with a deadly counterattack.

   1122589|00000000||Is it my imagination, or does Baronet Lupin look a bit out of sorts today?
   1122591|00000000||You've not heard? His sawmill's gone up in smoke! Some knights of the Order of the Flaming Rose, they say.
   1103509|00000000||No sign of Borsodi…
   1103511|00000000||Perhaps he'll look in at intermission.
   1103563|00000000||Has he always been such a recluse?
   1103565|00000000||No. It began after his father passed. Apparently, he turned inward.
   1103513|00000000||Ugh. The Borsodi House is going to the dogs, by gods.
   1103515|00000000||But why would you say so?
   1103605|00000000||Look around, man. Look who he admits. A nonhuman, the nouveau riche, and-- there! There! A mutant!
   1103505|00000000||I believe I'll bid on that Gourbet landscape.
   1103507|00000000||A landscape? You detest them.
   1103544|00000000||Ever true. But it's got a lovely frame.
   1103523|00000000||These contemporaries - I simply don't understand their art.
   1103525|00000000||That would look splendid in the boudoir.
   1103527|00000000||Psst! The cat-eyed one - that's Gerard of Rinbe. I've heard many tales.
   1103517|00000000||I beg your pardon, but… well, have we met?
   1103519|00000000||I don't believ-- Wait! Indeed. What's it been - two years, perhaps three? A decorative sword - we both bid on it!
   1103617|00000000||That's right! At that auction - all the lots were from the estate of that family. Starts with an "e." Erevec? Erebec?
   1103619|00000000||Oh, unimportant. I'd rather hear how that sword's served you.
   1103521|00000000||Vivaldi… Perusing the room for any and all to fleece.
   1122799|00000000||You jest! They're honorable men who serve the one god.
   1122801|00000000||King Radovid apparently stripped them of that service. They've found other employ.

   1122619|00000000||Know Joz, lives down the hillock? They stole his wean!
   1122621|00000000||Them knights again? Order men, but gone rogue?
   1122623|00000000||Them's the ones.
   1122625|00000000||Damned cockanapes're everywhere. But what good's Joz's kid to them?
   1122627|00000000||Took him as punishment. Missus Joz held back two sacks o' grain on them.
   1122629|00000000||Joz came home from town, tossed the sacks on a cart and hauled them to the woods. Got the little one back only then.
   1122631|00000000||End times indeed, with such evil afoot even here…
   1119224|00000000||Have a swig with us, witcher.
   1119177|00000000||Your health, sir dwarves! May your beards grow long but never tangle round your ankles!
   1119180|00000000||Tae the young lovers! May their loins never cool!
   1119182|00000000||May they sire many a bairn and reap gobs o' coin!
   1119276|00000000||If I may, Shani, I'd show you how I cut a jig. Nimble as a leopard.
   1119280|00000000||Don't let me stop you.
   1119772|00000000||I wager none here's ever seen a juggling witcher.
   1119779|00000000||Gather 'round, all, to behold a great wonder! A juggling witcher! The one and only!
   1119781|00000000||Look carefully, Shani! Ever seen such deft hands?
   1121500|00000000||I would love to show you what else they can do.
   1122609|00000000||What's that yer blabbin'? Armed ruffians waylayin' travelers - they's Order men?
   1122611|00000000||Aye, so I've heard.
   1122613|00000000||Crack is Radovid took the Order of the Flaming Rose, purged it of the dregs, the worst of the lot not even fit for his army.
   1122615|00000000||It cannae be…
   1122617|00000000||So the scum regrouped, started in plyin' the banditry trade.
   1119229|00000000||Hey there, 'ansum - drink with us.
   1119231|00000000||Don't make us beg. We're toastin' the newlyweds.
   1119870|00000000||So, Shani, was it to your liking?
   1119872|00000000||It was positively gripping.
   1122428|00000000||Drink with us!
   1119215|00000000||I never say no to a lady! To your fair beauty! And to yours, Shani, naturally!
   1119217|00000000||Your health and happiness.
   1119219|00000000||Fortune smile upon you, White Wolf.
   1119283|00000000||Why, the way you move! What charm, what grace!
   1119285|00000000||Thanks.
   1125943|00000000||Columbines from Giverny... Wonder who brought them.
   1125945|00000000||Could Shani be missing Vlod?

   1126140|00000000||Of all these flowers, you, my dear, are loveliest.
   1126142|00000000||Believe the young man's mistaken me for another.
   1126739|00000000||Not at all. I like my women as I like my peaches - fuzzy and well ripe.
   1126160|00000000||That's enough! Get goin'. You're drunk and randy. Nothin' good's ever come o' that mix.
   1126165|00000000||Git, git! Or I'll call my man over!
   1126349|00000000||Found yourself a perch from which to survey passing beaux?
   1126351|00000000||What do you mean? My back aches from poundin' the churn. So I'm havin' a rest.
   1126771|00000000||And they said fire burns hotter in an old stove!
   1126355|00000000||If I was your age, you'd be singing a different tune. Have you squealin' like a kitty cat.
   1126799|00000000||Changed your mind, my nymph?
   1126359|00000000||Won't you ever leave me be?!
   1126801|00000000||Stay out of the cellar over long, cobwebs will seal it shut. Luckily, I've a great broom…
   1126362|00000000||Agh, go nag another!
   1119287|00000000||I need but close my eyes to behold how you look when--
   1119289|00000000||Best not finish that thought.
   1121492|00000000||Ehh, so we shan't visit the loft?
   1121494|00000000||No.
   1121496|00000000||Rats.
   1138357|00000000||Brother
   1116157|00000000||What is that…?
   1116159|00000000||Another memory?
   1119386|00000000||No. A nightmare.
   1119388|00000000||A fear embodied, which sooner or later you will have to confront.
   1116153|00000000||That specter again.
   1119390|00000000||One of the mistress' fears incarnate.
   1116496|00000000||Iris was painting the manor.
   1114784|00000000||We should get a dog… Or a dog and a cat - even better.
   1114790|00000000||When the rain comes, the dog will warm my feet, and the cat will play with a ball of yarn by the fire. What do you think?
   1114792|00000000||Are you even listening?
   1114794|00000000||Apologies, dear. Had my mind on my book.
   1114796|00000000||Is it that terribly absorbing?
   1114798|00000000||Hm? Yes, terribly. Know what? Let's go inside.
   1114800|00000000||Why? It's lovely out here. The birds singing, the bees buzzing… Blissful, really.
   1116328|00000000||Sorry, dear… I feel unwell. I'll go in, you stay a while longer.
   1122658|00000000||Specters of Olgierd and his wife? But why aren't they moving?
   1126473|00000000||This is a memory.
   1126483|00000000||But it's incomplete, blurred. You must peer closely and restore it.
   1130667|00000000||Think this goes here…
   1134302|00000000||Shit, bees!

   1137081|00000000||Geralt was tasked with finding Vlodimir von Everec and showing him the time of his life. This would have been one of the witcher's least remarkable missions – had not Vlodimir been dead for years at this point. The mysterious Master Mirror did not think this much of an obstacle, however. He handed Geralt a vial of von Everec blood and told him of an incantation which would summon Vlodimir from the grave. Geralt thus journeyed to the von Everec family crypt and sought out the younger von Everec's place of burial.<br>
   1137082|00000000||Geralt's meeting with Vlodimir began with a fight against other deceased members of the von Everec clan. Only after they were defeated did Vlod reveal himself, explaining he'd refused to fight alongside his dead kin as he'd never been particularly fond of them. Overall Olgierd's brother cut a strange figure, even for a ghost. He showed hints of noble refinement, but often his mannerisms better resembled those of a lifelong brawler or hooligan – no doubt because he had spent much of his living years raiding and marauding with a band of rough characters.<br><br>One thing is certain: Vlodimir liked to have a good time and had found death sorely lacking in quality entertainment. His demands for his night of fun were simple. He mainly wanted to get well and thoroughly plastered and... well, let us say the dead man's inability to enter into relations with the fairer sex had tormented him terribly. All in all, after hearing Geralt relate Vlodimir's complaints about the afterlife, I feared death all the more... <br>
   1137083|00000000||Vlodimir jumped into Geralt’s body and together they accompanied Shani to her friend's wedding. There Vlod found more than enough entertainment to scratch his itch. He dove for slippers in a pond, played gwent, drank enough for three horses, chased pigs and even managed to steal a kiss from Shani.<br><br>When midnight struck, the capping ceremony began and Vlodimir von Everec’s time among the living came to an end. Yet the witcher’s skin had felt so good on him, he had no intention of shedding it. Only the appearance of Master Mirror finally forced Vlodimir back whence he came. In Geralt’s account, Master Mirror caused Vlod’s ghost a great deal of pain while banishing him. I do not know exactly how one can cause a disembodied spirit pain, but clearly Master Mirror knew a way. He was strange, that one. Even thinking about him now gives me goosebumps.

   1103804|00000000||Strange choice of locale. Guessing there's a reason for it?
   1103808|00000000||Not my choice.
   1103815|00000000||Wasn't me who chose it.
   1103817|00000000||I assumed so.
   1103809|00000000||This place is good as any.
   1103819|00000000||Place like any other. Could easily have met somewhere else.
   1103821|00000000||Yet we've met here. And something tells me that's not purely coincidental.
   1103852|00000000||Fulfilled the third wish.
   1103946|00000000||How do I know this to be the rose? Very well might've picked this up at the Oxenfurt market an hour ago.
   1103948|00000000||Look closely at it.
   1103955|00000000||Got it from Iris. It was the last thing that bound her to this world.
   1103958|00000000||What?
   1103959|00000000||Iris didn't want to exist anymore.
   1103977|00000000||Iris was tired of living half-alive, half-dead. Think she just wanted it to end.
   1103979|00000000||Can't blame her. I condemned her to terrible suffering.
   1103960|00000000||This rose is a symbol of your parting. Of punishment.
   1103981|00000000||Decided she'd treat you like you once treated her. The rose is a symbol of your parting. And a punishment.
   1103983|00000000||I suppose I deserve that…
   1103944|00000000||Wha-- What's happenin'?
   1109731|00000000||I feel as though… as though… a hot iron's pierced my chest.
   1103849|00000000||Fulfilled your third wish.
   1103855|00000000||What is this?
   1103880|00000000||A canvas. And on it, your house, your wife and the rose you gave her that day.
   1103882|00000000||This is not what I asked for.
   1103884|00000000||Phrased your wish wrong.
   1103887|00000000||Not the first time. And it's been my downfall.
   1103898|00000000||So beautiful… she looks alive.
   1103900|00000000||She is, in a way. Iris painted this, then… entered it.
   1103902|00000000||What? How…?
   1103935|00000000||Think she missed you - the real you. She wanted the pact to expire, so you could be yourself again. How you were before. No matter the price.
   1103923|00000000||She wanted the pact to end, you to be yourself again.
   1103938|00000000||My guess is she wanted to punish you. So she helped me fulfill your wish.
   1103941|00000000||Can't blame her. After all that's happened, she's every right to detest me.
   1103924|00000000||She wanted to punish you, so she helped me fulfill your wish.
   1103922|00000000||She loved you, wanted to be close.
   1103928|00000000||I don't know… she loved you, maybe she just wanted to be close again?
   1103931|00000000||She wished to be close? After all that passed?
   1104001|00000000||Iris… what a mess we made of it all… If I'd only known then how it would end…
   1141641|00000000||Heh? Ah… agh! Hu-uh-oh… Ogh! Argh…
   1128412|00000000||Wait.
   1128414|00000000||Do not interfere, witcher. Remember what I did to the last fool who interrupted me?
   1104151|00000000||You grant wishes, right? Grant mine and release him.
   1104153|00000000||He must repay his debt.
   1104155|00000000||Let him go, and I'll take it on, we'll call it mine.
   1104157|00000000||You wish to give your soul for his?
   1104196|00000000||No, but we can play for them. I lose, you take mine and Olgierd's. But if I win, you release us both.
   1126906|00000000||What do you propose we play? Gwent?
   1126909|00000000||Don't know… Maybe we can bet… on a challenge. You know I'm good at accomplishing the impossible. Seen me do it.
   1104198|00000000||Hmm… very well. But we shall do this my way.
   1104139|00000000||[Help Olgierd.]
   1137760|00000000||Never wanna go hungry again.
   1104254|00000000||Never wanna go hungry again.
   1104256|00000000||Sounds practical. And can be arranged.
   1104259|00000000||What's this?
   1104261|00000000||A horn of plenty. From this day forward, whenever you're hungry, reach in to find something to eat.
   1137761|00000000||A bottle of vodka that's always full.
   1104280|00000000||An endless supply of vodka. Or clear spirit. Either'll do, really.
   1104282|00000000||Heheh, now there's a wish I understand. It's as good as done.
   1104285|00000000||Not impressed. Seems pretty ordinary.
   1104287|00000000||Appearances are oft deceiving. The carafe is bottomless. As long as you have it, you will never want for liquor.
   1137762|00000000||Make me rich.
   1104292|00000000||I wanna be rich.
   1104294|00000000||Rich? Truly? Hm, banal… but all right, I gave my word. You asked, you shall receive.
   1104297|00000000||That should do the trick.
   1109795|00000000||Tell me about Ciri.
   1109906|00000000||You know who Ciri is, so you know how much she means to me. Of course I want to keep her from any danger.
   1109908|00000000||Then there's a few things you must remember.
   1110491|00000000||There will come a time when she will come to you defeated, resigned. Find a way to make her laugh.
   1109910|00000000||There will come a time when one will betray her. Let her vent her rage.
   1109912|00000000||There will come a time when she will grieve for a friend. Grieve with her.
   1110493|00000000||There will come a time when fear will engulf her. Instill courage in her, but do not act in her stead.
   1110494|00000000||And never, ever let her feel as if you've sold her out.
   1137763|00000000||Don't want anything from you.
   1109764|00000000||Don't want a thing from you.
   1109771|00000000||Are you certain? I am capable of a great deal…
   1109773|00000000||Never been surer. Goodbye, O'Dimm.
   1104311|00000000||What now? Off to find another poor fool?
   1104314|00000000||Haven't decided yet. But I do know if I ever have trouble collecting a debt, I shall turn to a witcher.
   1104247|00000000||Wanna be fast. So fast no one'll ever catch me.
   1104249|00000000||Hmm. Interesting wish. I think I've just the thing.
   1104252|00000000||Take this. Place it on your steed, and you will ride swift as the wind.
   1137759|00000000||Wanna be as swift as the wind.
   1137764|00000000||Wanna know where Ciri is.
   1109780|00000000||Tell me where to find Ciri, my--
   1109782|00000000||Adopted daughter, I know. Sadly, I can't be of service.
   1109784|00000000||Why not?
   1109786|00000000||There are certain things even I cannot meddle with.
   1109788|00000000||Ciri is hidden from my gaze, she's beyond my reach.
   1109790|00000000||But finding her's not what should concern you most - because you will, I'm certain of it.
   1109792|00000000||So what should?
   1109794|00000000||A great danger lies in wait. If you wish, I can tell you how you might evade it. Unless you'd prefer to ask for something else?
   1109796|00000000||I'd like to ask for something else.
   1109861|00000000||If I'm sure to find her, that's good enough for me. Handle the rest myself.
   1109863|00000000||Then my original offer stands.
   1104211|00000000||At last, it's over.
   1104213|00000000||We must meet again one day. Business with you is pure pleasure.
   1126911|00000000||Gonna remove the brand?
   1126913|00000000||Ah, right away. Done.
   1104215|00000000||Now tell me what reward you've chosen.
   1132012|00000000||It is done. Your soul belongs to me.
   1132014|00000000||Aaaaaaargh…
   1132018|00000000||Ahh!
   1104140|00000000||[Don't get involved.]
   1104144|00000000||Well, what do you know.
   1131997|00000000||What--? No. We… we had a pact.
   1131999|00000000||The Moon is there. THERE! Not…
   1132001|00000000||Here…
   1132003|00000000||I gave you what you wished for. Here, on the moon, our contract you fulfill.
   1132005|00000000||You… whoreson…
   1132008|00000000||You cheated me.
   1132010|00000000||I never cheat.
   1104105|00000000||Sorry to have kept you waiting.
   1104108|00000000||So glad to see everyone's made it.
   1109756|00000000||How do you feel, von Everec? A little… less troubled, lighter on the heart?
   1104110|00000000||O'Dimm. What do you want?
   1104112|00000000||What do you mean, "what"? Your soul.
   1104114|00000000||You forget. The pact states you can take it only once you've fulfilled three wishes and--
   1104116|00000000||And we stand together on the Moon.
   1141639|00000000||Heh? Ah… agh! Hu-uh-oh… Ogh! Argh…
   1103989|00000000||Iris… what a mess we made of it all… If I'd only known then how it would end…
   1103962|00000000||I think… think she loved you. Meant this as a token of that love.
   1103974|00000000||She loved me? After all that's passed?
   1103956|00000000||It's a token of her love for you.
   1103823|00000000||But since we're here, I believe you have something for me.
   1103811|00000000||You're an art lover. Thought you'd appreciate the place.
   1103813|00000000||A witcher with aesthetic sensibility? Forgive my disbelief.
   1103807|00000000||Just catering to your love of the arts.

Perhaps I’ll get the coin by then, perhaps my tears will convince your father, perhaps the gods will hear our prayers – or if not they, perhaps some devil will. If nothing else helps, I’ll crash into the temple through the window and swoop you up from the altar. We’ll flee somewhere far, far away, to the edge of the world, where no one will find us.<br><br>You write of sadness. I feel its weight, too. I think of you constantly. Of how we sat at the Alchemy till dawn nursing a bottle of wine, and you traced our dream house in the sawdust on the floor. Of how we dangled our feet in the water from the dock and you sang those bawdy songs and made me laugh and laugh.

   1113901|c799bcb6||Brethren!<br><br>I write you now in my own blood, so you may now what fate befell me.<br><br>Following M’s orders, I traveled to Novigrad to resupply and sell our latest batch of fisstech. I left the men in my command on our boat along with the goods and the coin while I went to the hut on the beach to await WJ’s men. When they arrived, it was well after dark, and one of them bore a linen sack on his back. This sack did not contain the promised Novigrad crowns – instead, it held the heads of my men. The scoundrels demanded to know where the fisstech was, but I only told them about the case on the ship, which they will never open without the key. My choice to slip this into my arse shortly before they caught me proved wise, for they searched everywhere else. Though they interrogated me harshly, I withheld the truth. Instead I insisted one of the men they murdered on the ship was carrying the key, and my role was merely to negotiate. They wanted to kill me at once, but their captain had another idea at the last minute. They locked me in this becursed cage, to wither and die slowly from hunger and thirst.<br><br>The second day of my captivity I heard the screams of my captors. I know not whether I saw true or visions, but it seemed drowners had emerged from the water and were devouring the whoresons alive. Yet the problem remains that they (the whoresons, not the drowners) have so securely locked me in I see no means of escape…<br><br>I have sat here six days now. I stopped feeling hunger after the third, my guts having turned in on themselves. Now I dream only of drink. I’d give all the gold in the world for a sip of water. It could be rank and full of larvae, and still I would guzzle it greedily… I drank my own urine for the first few days, but I no longer produce any.<br><br>I have nothing left. Not even hope. The last thing keeping me sane is the task of writing this letter to you. Farewell.<br>Anselm

My aunt Helena had finally passed on and left all her belongings, including her hut outside Novigrad, to me. The letter included a copy of her will and a key to the chest in which she had stashed her savings. Remembering how my dear auntie would serve her guests only bread and water, I was sure she’d managed to save up a hefty stash of coin during her long and miserly life. So I raced off in a flash to my aunt’s hut, to pay my respects at her grave, and while there, take a gander at what’s in that chest. But when I got there, the hut was in ruins and the neighboring peasants were claiming a griffin had nested on my aunt’s lands. So there I was, a fortune in arm’s reach, and not a way to get at it. So I went back to Oxenfurt and raced to the Alchemy, fast as my feet would take me, for I’d heard the famous Kulik Kulikov and his crew were watering their horses there after their latest adventure. We agreed terms quick enough (he’d get a portion of what we found in the chest) and set off to exterminate this ploughing pest of a griffin.<br><br>Now I’m sitting and watching Kulikov’s lads arm the ballista, writing this all down to calm my nerves and pass the time.<br><br>Fun’s about to start!

They cost a fortune and left me with barely enough funds to pay the rent for my laboratory, but now I can begin my work in earnest. I’ll soon show those pea-brained admirals of ours that airborne armies are the future of warfare! And the first such army shall be my creation, and shall proudly bear the name of the Redanian Air Force!<br><br>They’ve hatched. Never seen harpies so tiny and – dare I say? – cute. They have no bosoms yet, but do have enormous heads and equally enormous appetites. Bird-like, through and through.<br><br>My first attempts at taming them have brought promising results. The young harpies eat out of our hands, and sometimes eat our hands as well – my assistant’s already lost 2 fingers.<br><br>The ealdorman of Heddel came skittering into our tower, desperately bawling about spiders plaguing in his village, begging for our help, weeping for their picked-upon livestock and offspring, who suffer the most from the arachnoids' bites. Hmph. One swarm of mindless eating machines preying on another. How dare he interrupt my work on the <i>Wunderwaffe</i> for such banalities?! Instead of the arachnocide he requested, I gave him a bottle of arachnomorph pheromones. Won’t he be in for a surprise. But do the peasants not say “spiders and snakes a happy home make”? I’m sure I've heard them say something of the sort.<br><br>Our funds are nearly exhausted. I shall be forced to take something from the rainy day stash I hid from Hubert in the top floor of the tower. The bulk of our outflow goes towards the purchase of pork, which the harpies devour in gargantuan quantities. Perhaps if we were to dress one up in Redanian armor now and present it at court, the king himself would become our patron?<br><br>No, no, no! The entire squadron must be present, else Radovid will deem the whole undertaking a farce!<br><br>It seems our harpies have grown tired of pork. I found the scraps of Hubert’s overalls in one of their cages. No great loss. Hubert had already lost 8 fingers feeding them. Couldn't even grip a broom.<br><br>Catastrophe has struck! Someone opened all the cages and let out the harpies! I’m sure I’ll find them wheezing their last in the grass outside the tower – after all, no one has fed them for a week…

   1135722|6f1db9a4||The essence of Evil is to cause suffering. There exist many varieties of suffering: from common corporeal pain through the rarefied torment of the psyche to deep wounds dealt to the soul. Whence then does Evil arise? Does it appear on its own? Or does it only spread when conditions are ripe? And finally, the most important question: How can Evil be defeated?<br><br>Most believe Evil has always existed, for none remember a time when it did not. Yet is that sufficient proof? I dare to doubt it, for I am a scholar, and the essence of scholarship is to question all hypotheses until they have been rigorously proven.<br><br>The appearance of Evil is closely tied to the existence of Good, its opposite and antithesis. Good without evil is dimensionless and therefore imperceptible. Evil, then, is an integral part of our lives.<br><br>Evil wears many faces and appears in many different forms. One of them wears a skin of flesh. This Evil incarnated as man travels the world, sowing death and suffering. Such Evil is devious and difficult to discern. We usually only note its presence when it is already too late.<br><br>In my scholarly wanderings through the myths and legends of a great many cultures, I’ve come across descriptions of a certain individual which all display a striking similarity. I do not mean in terms of this individual’s outer appearance or name, but of his modus operandi. This Evil works through trickery, tempting at first with the offer of something seemingly good. The price one must pay for this object of temptation, however, is enormous and nonrefundable, and the promised good often contains horrifying hooks and treacherous traps. Beware, then, of any who promise the impossible, for such can only be delivered through the machinations of Evil.

   1134211|f4ff2014||Chapter 1: Novice<br><br>Those wishing to be trained in the surgical arts should be chosen by taking candidates to a battle field. By this I do not mean any old meadow in which two cutpurses slaughtered a merchant, but a true battle field strewn with strips of human flesh. If after seeing such a sight the potential novice does not fall into convulsions and run weeping for the Great Mother's mercy, there is a chance he will prove of some use in the future.<br><br>Each student should begin by working on the dead. A badly stitched corpse will bear no grudges. Once the beginning surgeon can tell hands from feet, he can be assigned to work on non-terminal patients.<br><br>A surgeon is not a miracle worker. His golden rule is: Sew red to red, yellow to yellow, white to white, and everything will be all right.

   1122936|7406f1b2||I’ve naught left. Not a blooming thing. All I can do now's pass on my family's tale of horror and woe, then pass on myself, soon as I’ve written it all up in this letter.<br><br>Seems a faded dream now, but there were a time when we were happy. My beautiful wife, Ornesta, and myself.  We were married in high style, with a fitting feast, then a year later our dear Mildburga was born. Folk praised the wean’s beauty, said she were the spitting image of her mum. Ornesta’d get all cross when they talked like that, but I paid it no heed at the time. Soon enough our family grew. First Matilda, then Ethel came into the world, both fair as angels. But Ornesta… well, I’ll never forget the eve she sat there, combing her long, chestnut hair while the girls cried and cried. I said to her, “Love, I reckon the lasses’re hungry.” That’s when she lashed out at me for the first time. Said they'd no right to be hungry – they’d stolen her beauty and her youth, that should be more than enough to feed on…<br><br>I should’ve known it then. I should’ve guessed madness had burrowed into my love’s head, and every compliment paid to her lasses' beauty made it burrow ever deeper. Year by year, the young'un's grew taller and more lovely. But time’s not so kind to the old, and Ornesta weren't spared its cruelty, which took her skin’s spring and its sheen of youth.<br><br>One night I was awoken by a startling moon which lit all the world in an eerie glow. I looked around the hut, and saw it was empty. I ran out the door and followed a set of bare footprints, leading to the cemetery by the chapel. Seeing that, my heart jumped up into my throat…<br><br>I found them, all three, lying around the fountain. Were I not been their father, I’d never have recognized them. Deep gashes mutilated their fair faces. Strips of skin and hunks of flesh were strewn all about… As I stood beholding this butchery, I had the feeling someone was watching me. And I weren't mistaken. Ornesta stood there on a stool by a lone tree. She had a rope draped ‘round her neck like some demonic necklace. “They took it from me, all of it, all I had, all I cherished,” she said. Then she jumped.<br><br>She’s dead. My Ornesta. My three daughters – dead as well. I’ll soon join them. I’ve taken all I have and gave it to the gods, perhaps they’ll forgive me and my beloved Ornesta…

Only a portion of the notes have survived.]<br><br>Day 134<br>I came across the remains of a destroyed golem in the swamps outside Vizima… Words cannot describe the rage that overcame me. The brickmakers who  keep a settlement nearby told me this act of vandalism was perpetrated by some white-haired witcher. I had heard the members of that guild were vile whoresons, but to stoop to that!<br><br>Day 163<br>The idea struck me that I might find something of use in the Oxenfurt Academy archive. I managed, with great difficulty, to cross the Pontar, but once in Oxenfurt I met with an unpleasant surprise – the Academy has been closed! Luckily I was able to gain entry thanks to the help of a professor acquaintance of mine (thank you, Slavoy!). I thus was able to dig out a few dust-covered beauties and… eureka! Near the village of Heddel there’s a tower which (purportedly) once served as a workshop to none other than Master Alzur himself!<br><br>Day 164<br>I made it to the tower. It’s inhabited. A rather eccentric gentleman has made it a roost for his flock of... harpies. I saw him feed their chicks pork! Inconceivable! But let’s return to our core concern. The tower which this loon has turned into a harpy nest truly might have once been Alzur’s workshop. That means this might be the very place where he conducted his research into golems… <br><br>Day 165<br>It’s here! Standing motionless in a stone circle! The local peasants think it’s merely a strangely-formed boulder, but then again, how could such bumpkins ever guess they pass a masterpiece of magic construction on the way to feed their chickens! I’ve already fastened a lightning conductor. It's a shame there are no druids nearby. If I hadn’t slept through my course on meteorological magic, I’d summon a storm myself, but as it is, I can but wait, patiently or otherwise…<br><br>Day 171<br>Been sitting on these cold stones waiting for a change in the weather so long my bowels have almost frozen, but it’s finally here! I must stop writing now for drops are falling on my notebook and smearing my notes. The first rumblings of thunder sound in the distance! I cannot contain my excitement. Soon, the golem shall live again!
   1122953|d2baf054||The Tale of Barrengarth
   1122954|f1632238||There once was a young woman named Marlene and a young man named Bartholomew. Bartholomew was so handsome no maid could tear her eyes off him. Every maid in the village, from the fairest to the plainest, yearned to win his favor.<br><br>Marlene, too, was struck by his beauty and soon fell in love with him, as a love as deep as only a first love can be. This feeling was so overwhelming, Marlene realized she could never live without Bartholomew. Yet it was her misfortune that by then Bartholomew already had a wife and a young son.<br><br>Marlene refused to give in to this misfortune, however, and worked long and hard to convince Bartholomew that she was his one true love. In the end she succeeded, for women possess the gift of persuasion and many a man has succumbed to their entreaties.<br><br>Bartholomew’s wife refused to accept his change of heart. But Marlene found a way to deal with that as well.<br><br>Marlene convinced Bartholomew he must get rid of his wife once and for all, and so he chopped off her head. Everything would have ended well, with the young lovers living happily ever after, had not the crime been witnessed by Bartholomew’s five-year-old son. Marlene saw no other solution than to convince Bartholomew, by now her rightful husband, to dispose of the child like his mother and bury his body next to hers, so that they might be together for all eternity.<br><br>Yet this time Bartholomew put his foot down and refused to do what Marlene asked of him. “It is one thing to kill my wife, but to kill my child, the fruit of my loins?” he said. He only changed his mind when the lad began to speak, loudly and frequently, about what he had seen. And though Bartholomew could never raise his hand against his firstborn son, he found another way to deal with the problem. While the boy slept, he snuck into his room, lifted him up and set him in a coffin, which he then buried under the apple tree in their yard.<br><br>After that day, strange things began occurring in the area where the couple lived. The trees lost their leaves and stopped bearing fruit. Folk dwelling nearby were hounded by evil dreams. One by one they fled their homes and farmsteads, until only Marlene and Bartholomew were left.<br><br>One day Marlene dreamt the boy had awoken in his casket under the apple tree and begun to cry. She yearned to have a child of her own and such dreams troubled her greatly. She thus took a spade and dug up the coffin. Inside she found the child’s body, but its arms or legs were missing. She thought the poor lad must have gnawed them off from wild hunger before he died. The sight of the child’s mangled torso so terrified Marlene she reburied the coffin at once and never said a word about it to her husband.<br><br>They lived together a great many years afterwards, but theirs was not a good life. Bartholomew had changed. He slowly stopped cherishing Marlene, and then stopped speaking. He hanged himself on the night of the summer solstice, leaving his wife alone with her dreams. Before she died, Marlene dug up the child’s coffin one more time. No one knows where she went and what she did with it. Their lands have lain deserted ever since. No plants will grow there, and no birds sing.<br><br>Wilhelm & Jacob G.

Been sitting here eight days now, and naught's happened. Besides that one grain caravan, which we raided, sending the merchants off running in only their unspeakables.

(minus 35% transaction fee)<br>Sculpture: Giann'Lorenzo - "The Ecstasy of Gvalch'ci the Bloody," buyer: Rudolf de Jonkheer, 550 Nov. crowns (minus 35% transaction fee)<br>Sadly, I was unable to finalize the sale of “Pietas” by Michel’Angellach to Brandon & Co., Inc. The company sued for a deferment of the sale due to some claimed financial difficulties (rumors around town claim the firm’s senior partner was robbed in broad daylight by some white-haired (sic!) witcher), but for obvious reasons I did not agree to prolong the payment period. A messenger with the earnings will present himself at the agreed-upon spot. I impatiently await the next transport.<br><br>Yaromir E. Carstairs

Introduced himself politely enough, calling himself Krister, saying he was a tinker from Oxenfurt, come to escape the hue and cry of the big city, but something about him stinks of lies to my nose. He don’t look like the peace-searching kind, more like the peace-disturbing sort. Trouble, I’m telling you!<br><br>No doubt knocked up some maid in town or, even worse, did one in – looks like a killer to me. He’s as much a tinker as I’m an Ofieri enchanter.

   1135720|8de33a5b||My Notes and Observations<br>Professor Shakeslock<br>The circle O’Dimm created terrifies me. I cannot see it, but I know it is here. I know no name for the sense with which I perceive it. When I near its bounds, strange shivers shoot down my spine. This is not pain, but something that stands my hair on edge like a hedgehog’s quivers.<br><br>A month has passed, and still I stay within the runic circle. Nightmares prey on me more and more. I’ve come to fear sleep. I know not how long I can withstand this.<br><br>I dreamt I had a daughter. This was strange, for I’ve never had children, yet one came to me in my sleep. She was no older than ten. She called me “daddy” and loved me deeply. I could see it in her eyes. The strangest part of all was that I also burned for her with a great paternal love. Can one possibly dream of someone who does not exist? Can one love such a one?<br><br>I no longer fear sleep. Perhaps O’Dimm has decided to give me peace. I have no desire to change his mind.<br><br>My dreams of Amelie give me great joy. My daughter is a good and clever girl. I believe she will grow into a wonderful woman. A shame she exists only in my dreams. Not only do I no longer fear sleep, but now I cannot wait for the moment in which it comes. What a fantastic transformation! If nothing changes, I shall soon try to leave the circle.<br><br>I know now why I dreamt for weeks of the child I never had. It was his doing. This night my daughter died. She caught a strange illness which pocked her whole body with hideous, oozing sores. She cried, begging me to help. I could do nothing. She died in my arms. I awoke soaked with sweat. I remain a wreck, my mind tattered.<br><br>Three months have passed since Amelie’s death. My heart still bleeds, and horrifying visions plague my every moment. I’m a blind man who wishes he saw nothing, for utter blindness would be a relief compared to these tormenting visions.<br><br>I cannot persevere much longer. I have become a deeply unhappy old man.<br><br>I have now lived within the magic circle for a year. Thoughts of suicide haunt my mind ever more often. It would be so simple – I need but step outside the runes…

Introduced himself as a biologist. Fellow made a bad impression on me from the start. Short, thin, with a hunched back. Spectacles thick as wine bottles perched on his nose. Had to grin and bear it, though, for he was willing to pay generously (and in species) to rent the tower, first three months delivered in advance. The owner agreed, so what could I do? But I was curious about this "biologist" and wanted to learn what he wanted a whole tower for. He was cagey at first, then let slip, giddy with excitement, that he planned to rear harpies. “You don't rear harpies!” I cried, but he retorted that he'd soon change that and his tamed, tower-bred harpies would prove their use in warfare. Sure, I can see it already: winged vermin donning the Redanian red, flying off all in a row… I swear, if I've ever heard a bigger load of rubbish, my name ain't Rohn Drump!<br><br>[A few pages have been ripped out and… pecked?]<br><br>Vogel's late with the rent.

The learned gent's here, though. Thing is, he's dead. Something vicious sliced open his gut and dragged his innards all over the room… and that's not the worst part – in the workshop's backroom, there's an open cellar filled with half-eaten human corpses! The stank of death's unbearably strong, fills the whole tower. Don't give a rat’s arse anymore about the rent he owes. I’m getting the blazes out of here before something gets me, too…

   1097463|00000000||To distill an antidote? No use for it once the beast's dead.
   1097465|00000000||Not true. I have a few poisoned patients on hand. Besides, I can study the venom, test it, maybe discover some interesting properties.
   1119151|00000000||I hope you don't plan to cut yourself, or--
   1119153|00000000||Relax. Plenty of bodies. I'll use one of them.
   1119143|00000000||Need to lure the beast.
   1119147|00000000||How? We don't even know what kind of monster it is.
   1119149|00000000||But we do know it likes a blend of blood and liquor. Just so happens I've got some alcohol on me.
   1097361|00000000||Decaying corpses, slime everywhere, and that stench - this has to be the lair.
   1125341|00000000||Fresh and moist. Beast was just here.
   1097369|00000000||I'll collect my sample.
   1097372|00000000||Hm. All the tunnels and corridors converge here.
   1097375|00000000||What now?
   1134705|00e73e71||Cursed Mother
   1116647|00000000||High time for another round, intit?
   1116645|00000000||Don't I know you from somewheres?
   1127406|00000000||Whe… 'Cept for the donkey ears, that's the spittin' image of that, uh - hiccup!
   1127408|00000000||That, uh, Gerard of Riviera fellow…
   1097405|00000000||Your swords, master. Just need you to sign here.
   1097407|00000000||Fu-- Fuck you.
   1097409|00000000||Mmm. Depositor… refused… to confirm receipt. Signed Sergeant Figgner.
   1097411|00000000||A pleasant day to you.
   1097418|00000000||Seems true what they say - "When it's many against one, even a witcher's done."
   1095962|00000000||And you think you can help me - is that it?
   1097427|00000000||Really think you can help me?
   1097429|00000000||We can help each other.
   1101185|00000000||Get to the point. If you can.
   1097431|00000000||To get this house, you need to get into the vault. And there's no way Horst'll let you in there out of the kindness of his heart.
   1097435|00000000||A heist? Don't like that idea one bit.
   1123970|00000000||Got any others?
   1097437|00000000||Find the herbalist lives near Oxenfurt. Ask for some yarrow extract. He'll know why you've come.
   1097440|00000000||If this is a trap of some sort…
   1097442|00000000||Be seein' you. I hope.
   1097423|00000000||Hm, how'd you know I was looking for the House?
   1097425|00000000||I was at the auction. Disguised, of course. That argument on the topic was hard to miss.
   1095961|00000000||How would you know I'm looking for the House?
   1095956|00000000||Not in the mood for your peasant wisdom. Who the hell are you?
   1095958|00000000||If all goes well, daresay I'm your partner.
   1095960|00000000||Don't need any partners.
   1097421|00000000||Oh, I don't know about that. No chance you'll lay your hands on Max Borsodi's House alone.
   1097395|00000000||Argh… Ugh…
   1097397|00000000||Law says if you see someone hurt, you should summon a medic.
   1097399|00000000||Law doesn't say how fast, though. So you can sit tight a while.
   1097402|00000000||Seems true what they say - "Sword or no sword, a witcher brings gore."
   1097380|00000000||Your swords, master. Law says we're to return them.
   1097383|00000000||Law don't say when, though. So we'll do it, aye, just after we beat the singing shite out of the honorable gentleman.
   1097385|00000000||Mhm. Gathering place for the elite, truly.
   1097387|00000000||Come on, lads. Let's loosen our muscles a bit.

   1105000|00000000||Now don't get too comfortable. You got work to do.
   1105002|00000000||Hmm… Casimir's changed since I last saw him. Can't quite put my finger on it.
   1104994|00000000||Well? Gave you names, locations. What're you waitin' for?
   1104996|00000000||Told you already. This ain't a two-man job.
   1104998|00000000||Good choice. Quinto's got the nimblest fingers in all the North.

   1107918|00000000||Watch it! A witcher!
   1112896|00000000||Magiprickery!! Arrrgh!
   1128198|00000000||Just… we're not all evil.
   1128226|00000000||Just saying that even in a land as barbarous as this, you'll run into kind folk, too. Need a little luck, that's all.
   1128228|00000000||This I do not doubt. If you happen near the place where occurred this attack on us, ask, if will you, after diagrams marked in a foreign tongue.
   1128230|00000000||Where'd it happen, this attack?
   1128232|00000000||A crossroads, the ruins of a residence to its north, not far a sawmill, abandoned.
   1128234|00000000||Think I can remember that. Take care.
   1128200|00000000||Well, wouldn't want an Ofieri to say all easterners are thieves. Tell you what, lemme help you get those diagrams back.
   1128202|00000000||Is this truth? I should be grateful were you to find them. And in thanks draft duplicates marked in the tongue of your craftsmen. A gift for you.
   1128204|00000000||Where'd it happen, this attack?
   1128206|00000000||At a crossroads, a sawmill near to it. And the ruins of a residence to the north, I believe.
   1128208|00000000||See what I can do. Farewell.
   1128197|00000000||Willing to help you find those diagrams.
   1127113|00000000||Any unusual goods on offer?
   1127115|00000000||Got anything unusual? You know, goods you wouldn't normally show? Willing to pay a lot for things of the right… kind.
   1127141|00000000||Yes, something I had could of interest have been. Diagrams four, detailing how to forge gear fantastic . A gift for one of your kings to be they were.
   1128182|00000000||All now lost, I say sadly. I, with my companions, was on the high road. Attacked we were by locals. Of my brethren one cut down was, and our cargo all we lost.
   1127143|00000000||Mhm, lots of "locals" are like that, unfortunately. But not all.
   1128188|00000000||A particular reason you say this?
   1127120|00000000||Found a diagram with Ofieri markings.
   1127122|00000000||Found this diagram. Think the markings might be Ofieri, can't decipher them. Willing to help?
   1127145|00000000||This writing I recognize. We arrived in this land to immediate trouble - local men. Frankly, rogues. Attacked we were.
   1127149|00000000||These are good instructions to forge fantastic gear fit for a king. To the ruler here I was to present them. But assist me, retrieve the entire set, and I shall draft duplicates marked in the tongue of your craftsmen.
   1127153|00000000||Sounds like a fair deal. Think I can probably find those diagrams for you.
   1127155|00000000||These bandits, they knights seemed. A blow even harder.
   1127150|00000000||Course I'll help.
   1127151|00000000||Sorry, can't spare the time.
   1127159|00000000||Tempting, but I just don't have the time right now.
   1127161|00000000||I will keep hope. And give thanks should you turn your mind to searching for my diagrams when you find time.
   1128257|00000000||Where'd they attack you? And how many diagrams were there?
   1128259|00000000||Diagrams three remain missing. And the violence, at a crossroads it happened, a sawmill nearby. North of the spot, a residence, a ruin almost.
   1127157|00000000||Don't worry. I'll find your diagrams.
   1127483|00000000||So long.
   1127479|00000000||Farewell.
   1127478|00000000||Show me your goods.
   1127481|00000000||Show me what you got.
   1127473|00000000||Doing all right now?
   1127475|00000000||Thanks again. I'd 'ave been mincemeat if it's not for you. Name's Philibert Topical - but everyone calls me Master T.
   1127477|00000000||What do you think you need? Shrooms? A bit of 'erb, perchance?
   1127471|00000000||Oh, welcome back! Get a chance to think about those 'shrooms? Or the 'erb?
   1139419|00000000||<i>Quite often a wraith is tied to an object, something it clung to during life, or a location, such as its place of death. In either case, we are dealing with the same causal agent: a strong emotional tie from which the wraith draws strength.</i><br> – Inigo Swann, “Beyond the Natural World.”<br><br>While wandering the von Everecs’ abandoned estate, Geralt came into contact with a woman’s wraith haunting the house. The restless spirit had mastery over the house’s furnishings and in particular over the paintings hanging from its walls. It moved freely between their canvasses, entering one and exiting through another. At first it tried to scare Geralt into giving up his search, then, when it was clear this strategy would not work, it attacked him directly.<br><br>Geralt’s battle against the wraith proved very difficult, for it was fueled by rage and launched its attacks with heated aggression. Geralt was forced to move with lightning speed in order to parry its blows, without time to take a breath or launch an attack of his own. What’s more, the wraith had created a bond with the paintings around it and, until the witcher severed this tie, it would continually regain any lost strength.<br><br>The key to victory over the Wraith from the Painting was to focus on parrying its blows and only attack sporadically, at exactly the right moments. Any attempt to attack in a flurry was always punished with a deadly counterattack.

   1125630|00000000||Geralt is often taken for a boor. Nothing could be further from the truth: though rough-and-rowdy in outer appearance, inside Geralt harbors a sensitive appreciation of beauty and the arts. It should then come as no surprise he was able to impress the art merchant he met at the auction. The connoisseur tipped Geralt off about a van Rogh painting soon to go on the block. Apparently Marcus Hodgson, a famed Novigrad book dealer, was ready to pay a small fortune for it...<br>
   1125631|00000000||The merchant's assurances proved reliable: Geralt sold the painting at a considerable profit. The ecstatic book dealer also threw in a rare witcher trophy.

   1109679|00000000||Strange place…
   1109681|00000000||One born of Iris von Everec's dreams.
   1109683|00000000||It existed only in her mind while she lived. In death, it gained substance.
   1109685|00000000||Pretty fantastic tale. Hard as hell to believe.
   1109687|00000000||Yet you'd best believe it - and be on your guard. The Painted World is rife with danger.
   1109636|00000000||What is this place?
   1109638|00000000||The Painted World. The work of Iris von Everec.
   1109640|00000000||How'd you two get in here?
   1109642|00000000||We exist in both worlds at once.
   1109643|00000000||Where'd Iris go?
   1109689|00000000||All right. This is lovely and all, but… where's Iris?
   1109691|00000000||You awoke her but for a moment. If you wish to speak to her, you must tear her from her slumber completely.
   1109693|00000000||Sure, but how?
   1109695|00000000||You're a tracker, right? Saw you examinin' the tracks outside.
   1109697|00000000||Yeah, so?
   1109701|00000000||This is a world built of memories blurred and wilting. Moments our mistress wishes to forget, but cannot.
   1109903|00000000||You need to find them, restore them. Summon the fears that torment Iris and destroy them.
   1109703|00000000||Easy to say…
   1093188|00000000||…
   1107759|00000000||…
   1139681|00000000||<i>The human mind is as wild and unexplored a place as any land far beyond the seas. It is inhabited by manifold dangers – fears, painful memories, traumas. These lurk on the edge of our consciousness, like predators waiting for a moment of weakness in which to reveal themselves… and destroy us.</i><br> – Arturius Vigo, “The Essence of Spells and Illusions.”<br><br>The painted world created in the mind of Iris von Everec was mainly populated by figures from her memories, but was also home to dangerous, predatory creatures: the embodiments of her fears. The most dangerous of these, the Ethereal, invoked her greatest fear – and wore the face of her husband.<br><br>The Ethereal resembled Olgierd in appearance and also fought using a technique similar to his. A group of six such creatures lay in wait for Geralt, yet at first only one engaged him in battle. This one’s death awoke the next, which was more powerful than the first, and so it went to the end, with a stronger ethereal replacing a fallen weaker brother until all were defeated. Yet Geralt had to be careful, for the slightest amount of damage dealt to a being awaiting his turn would cause him to come alive and join his still-living comrade in the fight.<br><br>In the end, the best tactic against these nightmarish beings proved to be a well-timed counterattack.

   1100372|00000000||Well, look who's here! The witcher with the fists o' steel! What's new?
   1117698|00000000||What's he guilty of?
   1117700|00000000||What the fuck's it to you?! Not your concern, mate!
   1117715|00000000||Careful now.
   1117725|00000000||Tell you what's gonna happen now.
   1117735|00000000||I'll ask again, polite like, and you'll answer, just as politely.
   1117737|00000000||And if I don't?
   1117739|00000000||Then I'll get angry, stop talking, and slaughter you all like swine. So what'll it be?
   1117741|00000000||Am I gonna hear why you want to take his head… or not?
   1117743|00000000||Aren't you a thorny prick up the arse!
   1117745|00000000||Ataman said to kill him!
   1117747|00000000||Got your answer. Happy? Now piss off. We've work to do!
   1117751|00000000||Do what you will. Not my concern.
   1117790|00000000||Understood. Well, do what you have to. Not about to interfere.
   1117792|00000000||Gods, finally.
   1117794|00000000||No, please! Save me, help me!
   1117796|00000000||Told you to shut your gob!
   1125110|00000000||Well struck, witcher. You win.
   1125113|00000000||But perhaps you'd care to tell me why you meddled in a matter not yours?
   1125115|00000000||Wanted… to prevent… further bloodshed.
   1125117|00000000||Well, well… The witcher with the heart of gold.
   1125119|00000000||Unsavory as it seems, there is a silver lining - at least you now know I don't easily lose my head.
   1125123|00000000||Release him.
   1125125|00000000||Gettin' off cheap, mate.
   1100764|00000000||Killed the beast in the sewers.
   1100766|00000000||Congratulations are in order, then. Your reward. You're also welcome to take what you wish from the manor house - if anything's left uncharred, that is.
   1101258|00000000||Was it a tough fight?
   1100768|00000000||I sliced its gut open, and it turned into a man. You know that would happen?
   1100771|00000000||Of course he did. He'd never have dragged you into this elsewise.
   1100964|00000000||Gaunter O'Dimm. Come to cast aspersions?
   1100966|00000000||No. I've come to collect a debt.
   1100968|00000000||You know you first must--
   1100970|00000000||Grant you three requests… by proxy. I present to you my champion - Geralt of Rivia.
   1100972|00000000||That true - you knew the toad was a prince?
   1100988|00000000||That true? You know the toad was a cursed prince?
   1100990|00000000||He didn't just know - he brought about the curse himself.
   1101343|00000000||Ugh. Guess it's high time I got to work.
   1101345|00000000||A bit more enthusiasm, witcher. You know you just might enjoy yourself.
   1101347|00000000||Yay. Can't wait.
   1101349|00000000||Say I need help - where'll I find you?
   1101351|00000000||I shall find you.
   1101353|00000000||Good luck, Geralt.
   1101306|00000000||Let's do this.
   1101297|00000000||Olgierd's brother - why do you think he'll be tough?
   1101299|00000000||I'm afraid he's dead. Has been for years.
   1101301|00000000||Ugh… never agreed to necromancy.
   1101305|00000000||Necromancy is hardly your only option for reviving a soul. An old-fashioned ritual, a Blood Summoning - that's what you need.
   1107566|00000000||That's like choosing between pestilence and the plague. 'Sides, I'd need the blood of the summoned.
   1127028|00000000||Blood - true. Of the summoned - not necessarily. Here.
   1127030|00000000||Where'd you get this?
   1127032|00000000||Geralt, Geralt, Geralt - aren't you the curious one. Assume it to be von Everec blood and get on with it.
   1101325|00000000||Mhh, where'll I find this Vlodimir?
   1101327|00000000||Geralt, I cannot do everything for you. Use your head.
   1106938|00000000||The von Everecs are well-known in these parts. You must have met someone who's heard of the family.
   1101331|00000000||The charming redhead, for instance - the medic. You know the one.
   1101260|00000000||The brother - where is he?
   1101313|00000000||Borsodi's house - no idea how I'm supposed to bring him that.
   1101315|00000000||Hm, the only Borsodi I know of around here runs an auction house in Oxenfurt.
   1101317|00000000||Heard of it. My swords almost got auctioned off there once. Auction was held in Novigrad, though it was a while past.
   1106925|00000000||They must have relocated. You just might get an opportunity to ask them why.
   1106927|00000000||Fine, I'll go there. Then what?
   1101319|00000000||How should I know? Perhaps you'll get inspired once you're there.
   1101321|00000000||Oh, and take plenty of coin. I've a feeling it could come in handy.
   1101295|00000000||How am I supposed to bring him a house?
   1101261|00000000||Nice of you to wait for me.
   1101275|00000000||You waited for me. Nice of you.
   1101277|00000000||I could hardly abandon my proxy to the whims of fate.
   1101279|00000000||Thought I have to fulfill Olgierd's wishes myself.
   1101281|00000000||So states the contract. Yet nowhere does it forbid me from providing help.
   1101283|00000000||And something tells me you'll need quite a bit to complete the first two tasks.
   1101229|00000000||Once I'm done - with those two - where will I find you?
   1101231|00000000||I cannot know as my band has planned some diversions. But let us say at the Alchemy Inn. In Oxenfurt.
   1101233|00000000||Fine. See you there.
   1101252|00000000||The brother shouldn't be too hard, but the house? How'm I supposed to bring him a house?
   1101259|00000000||Actually, the opposite. I wouldn't worry about the house. The brother will be the tough bit.
   1106813|00000000||Where will I find you?
   1106814|00000000||Any helpful hints?
   1106817|00000000||Any hints? Where I should go? How I might start?
   1106819|00000000||You must be mad. I've no intention to make things easier for you.
   1101174|00000000||Guess I gotta pop the question directly - what do I need to do for you?
   1101201|00000000||Hmmm, let me think.
   1101219|00000000||We're currently without a roof over our heads. Perhaps we should start with that. Bring me the house of Maximilian Borsodi.
   1101221|00000000||His house?
   1101223|00000000||So surprised - but why? I must live somewhere, mustn't I?
   1107228|00000000||What's the meanin' of this?! Taken leave of your senses? You mean to mount a filthy horse?!
   1107231|00000000||Out of my sight, wretch! Know what Vlodimir would do to you if he saw?
   1107269|00000000||Aye.
   1107234|00000000||Vlodimir?
   1107273|00000000||My brother. There were times he himself stank like foot wrappings three days old, but his mount always looked fit for a parade.
   1101225|00000000||Oh, none rival Vlodimir at feasting, carousing. Sadly, he's been celebrating less of late… You must find him and show him the time of his life. My second request.
   1101203|00000000||Fine, seems easy enough. And the third?
   1101227|00000000||Complete those two, then we shall speak of the third.
   1101123|00000000||Your three requests - what are they?
   1101182|00000000||This… thing between you and Master Mirror, your quarrel - really rather not get involved.
   1101193|00000000||You already are, I fear. He did something for you. Now you've a debt to repay. Am I right?
   1101195|00000000||Yes.
   1101197|00000000||Well, then you'll not free yourself of him till you've paid it back. But never worry, I shall devise tasks so impossible you will never complete them, not if you go mad trying.
   1101199|00000000||But try your best and your debt shall be absolved, while I shall live in peace until Master Mirror finds another "aide-de-camp."
   1101172|00000000||Seems like a private spat to me. Rather not get involved.
   1101148|00000000||Could've told me the truth about the toad. Having a bit of fun at my expense?
   1101150|00000000||I simply wanted the beast dead. I could not know you would respond to the notice. Pure coincidence.
   1101152|00000000||Yet I must admit - when you, a witcher, answered the call, I thought it right. It's what you lot are trained to do.
   1101135|00000000||Might've been able to lift the curse.
   1101137|00000000||Perhaps, perhaps not. Then again - why bother?
   1101139|00000000||He was a human being.
   1101141|00000000||That bloody Ofieri mutt was no human. His kind does not deserve to live.
   1101146|00000000||You knowingly put me in danger?
   1101124|00000000||You turn the prince into a toad?
   1101126|00000000||What he said about the prince - that true? You turn him into a toad?
   1101159|00000000||Perhaps - or perhaps the Ofieri dauphin ate somethin' that disagreed with him. You never know with their cuisine.
   1101161|00000000||Never heard of food that turns men into monsters.
   1101163|00000000||Then perhaps it was somethin' he drank.
   1101165|00000000||Hrm.
   1101128|00000000||Ah, I cast the curse. Revenge for a deep disappointment. I was another man, then. Let rage get the better of me and hollered the words without ever thinkin' they could possibly come true.
   1100986|00000000||Did he not mention that bit? Well, then allow me to tell it. Quite the gripping story.
   1100883|00000000||Olgierd once loved a beautiful maiden named Iris. Yet her parents chose to offer her hand to the crown prince of Ofier. Olgierd grew to hate the poor sot.
   1100881|00000000||At first, he wished to kill him, then decided this would be too simple. So instead, he condemned the prince to a base life in a toad's bloated corpus.
   1100944|00000000||Yet he grew bored of watching him suffer and decided to end it. By your hand.
   1101117|00000000||Remind me, O'Dimm - who is to fulfill my last three requests?
   1101119|00000000||My assistant. Geralt.
   1101121|00000000||Then begone. I don't wish to look at your face any longer than I must.
   1106801|00000000||Come.
   1106903|00000000||Where to?
   1106906|00000000||The stables. My men are preparing to depart.
   1100982|00000000||Not so fast. Haven't agreed to anything yet.
   1100984|00000000||But you'll do it, of that I'm certain. Did you know Olgierd was the one to turn the Ofieri prince into a toad?
   1100971|00000000||Haven't agreed to this yet.
   1100676|00000000||Here for my reward.
   1126990|00000000||Know what this is?
   1126992|00000000||I cannot be certain, but I've my suspicions.
   1126994|00000000||That's a dangerous man you've chosen to deal with, witcher.
   1126983|00000000||Recognize the mark?
   1123185|00000000||Can't help wondering… man whose life I just saved - what was his crime?
   1123408|00000000||He slew the lass's father, the lord of the manor.
   1123411|00000000||Bloke joined our band recently. Quick to draw his blade, eager to fight.
   1123413|00000000||When we arrived, I made it plain - we'd arrived as guests. And as such, we would treat our hosts with honor.
   1123415|00000000||But the hosts would not have us. My company responded with ire, and the man you saved finally killed the master of the house.
   1123417|00000000||The chivalric code knows but one punishment for his crime.
   1123182|00000000||Why'd you condemn that man?
   1100677|00000000||So, you're immortal?
   1100713|00000000||You're… immortal?
   1100715|00000000||Depends on your understanding of the term. Indeed, I cannot be killed.
   1106799|00000000||But it's not at all what folk imagine. Not dying does not mean eternally living your life to the full.
   1100717|00000000||So it's a curse?
   1100719|00000000||A curse? No, wouldn't call it that. I'll put it this way - you must be careful what you wish for lest your wish be granted. For there are consequences.
   1100744|00000000||Not sure I follow.
   1100746|00000000||You know very little can hurt you, so you take wild risks, chase extreme sensations. There comes a point you've done it all, and all seems boring and monotonous.
   1100721|00000000||The trick's to plough through that moment, go further, reach beyond what's known as possible.
   1100661|00000000||Really necessary - that whole show?
   1100663|00000000||Beh, "show"? Come, now.
   1100665|00000000||A man must display some madness from time to time - helps him feel alive.
   1126966|00000000||Daresay you know what I mean - judging by the mark on your face.
   1125077|00000000||Aaargh!
   1125073|00000000||What is this row?
   1125075|00000000||Are you not done with him? My ears wither from the screams!
   1125079|00000000||Ah, Geralt. As you've returned, might I assume you've cleared the sewers?
   1125081|00000000||Or have you not been there?
   1125083|00000000||You killed my father!
   1125089|00000000||Not I.
   1125091|00000000||You lie, whoreson!
   1125095|00000000||That man killed him - alone, unbeknownst to me. Out of fury, for your father refused us hospitality. For this willful violation of the chivalric code, he was summarily executed himself.
   1125097|00000000||Anythin' else I might do for you?
   1125099|00000000||Take her away.
   1125101|00000000||Now where were we?
   1117787|00000000||Wait. I know Olgierd wants him dead. Still don't know why, though.
   1117847|00000000||Just what the fuck is it to you, anyhow?
   1117849|00000000||Nothing, really. Just curious.
   1117851|00000000||Cocksucker violated our chivalric code! Just one penalty for that - death!
   1117749|00000000||No need to be edgy. Let's talk about this.
   1117753|00000000||No, you don't. Let him go.
   1117755|00000000||Oh, this is bloody rich! Can't ploughin' believe me ears! You switch your brains with your cock, or somethin'?
   1117759|00000000||Get your mutant witcher arse out of here!
   1117761|00000000||Or?
   1117763|00000000||Or I'll kill ye!
   1117765|00000000||Go ahead, try.
   1117768|00000000||Whoa, whoa! What the bloody hell's this?!
   1117770|00000000||Geralt. Have you decided to play defender of the downtrodden?
   1117772|00000000||More like gutter of sons of bitches.
   1117774|00000000||Long as I'm here, you'll gut no one.
   1117776|00000000||That a challenge?
   1117778|00000000||Why not. I've not fought a witcher before. Defeat me, and I shall let him go.
   1117780|00000000||Stand aside!
   1117783|00000000||Would you wait, sir, for the dribble to subside?
   1117785|00000000||Makes no difference to me.
   1117941|00000000||Justly said. Stand and fight!
   1117750|00000000||Let him go or face my wrath.
   1117717|00000000||Whoa, nerves a little raw? Why?
   1117730|00000000||You deaf? Get the fuck out of here, freak!
   1117719|00000000||All I want is to know what exactly's going on here.
   1117732|00000000||Well you're not gonna know! Sod off!
   1117748|00000000||I'll leave soon as you tell me.
   1117712|00000000||Calm down, let's talk.
   1123174|00000000||Lemme go! Leave me be!
   1123176|00000000||Shut it!
   1123178|00000000||I ate with youse, drank with youse, fought beside youse! And you'd kill me now? I'm one of youse!
   1123180|00000000||You might've been. But not no more you ain't.
   1126962|00000000||Got a growth on your platter, there. You catch some kind of Ofieri pox?
   1126964|00000000||Could say so.
   1117842|00000000||Manor's burning - you noticed?
   1117844|00000000||That? Oh, right. You know how it is - feast drags on with plenty o' dancin', merry-makin', rough play, hehe. We got a bit carried away, truth be told.
   1123166|00000000||Plain to see. Where's Olgierd?
   1117835|00000000||Damned if I know. Must be somewhere hereabouts.
   1117838|00000000||No, please! I beg you!
   1117840|00000000||Shut your trap!
   1100382|00000000||Well, look who's here! The witcher with a stick up his arse! What's new?
   1112913|00000000||Witcher, sir, you flail your blade like a peasant.
   1112909|00000000||Shame to die in this rain.
   1112911|00000000||A witcher shall soon be buried. The skies weep.
   1136691|00000000||Bloody fight, looks like. Folk in the caravan didn't stand a chance. Tracks lead north.
   1136621|00000000||Someone was wounded. Started bleeding heavily.
   1136619|00000000||Ofieri diagram, another one. Useless if you don't know Ofieri, though.
   1136615|00000000||Interesting. Another diagram with Ofieri markings. Could use someone fluent in the tongue.
   1137043|00000000||Trail's gone cold. Tsk. Need to look around, see if I can't pick it up again.
   1137045|00000000||Lost the trail. Gotta look around for something else.
   1136613|00000000||Hmm. A diagram? Seem to be Ofieri markings on it. Might find someone who could explain them to me.
   1136617|00000000||Ofieri diagram, again. Should look around for someone who knows Ofieri.
   1137047|00000000||Found it! Leads this way.
   1136623|00000000||Hmm. Took a traveler hostage, I guess. Blood trail's the hostage's. Must've been a burden if they left him here to die.
   1136625|00000000||Trail ends here. Hmm. Dirt and ground cover concealing a hatch. Secret passageway?
   1131018|00000000||Who's Kendrick?
   1131039|00000000||Kendrick fellow - who is he?
   1131041|00000000||I-- We's partners. Sneak into derelict 'ouses. Always somethin' valuable lyin' about.
   1131042|00000000||Mhm. So you're a thief.
   1131044|00000000||Thieves steal from the livin'! What's the 'arm takin' from the dead?
   1131047|00000000||Kendrick went to open the door, I stood watch. Suddenly heard his lamp smash… then nothing, quiet. Called out to 'im, but…
   1131024|00000000||Wh-wh… what was that? One o' them foglets you spoke of?
   1131026|00000000||No.
   1131028|00000000||Phew, that's a stone off my--
   1131030|00000000||I'll see what that was and look for your partner. You--
   1131033|00000000||Ain't about to wait around. I'm out of here!
   1131035|00000000||Good question. What are you doing here?
   1131037|00000000||See… Kendrick and me, we thought, manor's been empty all these years, full o' fine things goin' to rot…
   1131017|00000000||Good question - what are you doing here?
   1130996|00000000||Kendrick? Kendrick? You there?!
   1130998|00000000||Not so loud.
   1131000|00000000||Aaah! Gods, scared me half to--
   1131002|00000000||Not so loud, I said. Fog's not natural. Could be something in there, hiding. Foglets or err-nymphs, for example.
   1131005|00000000||Don't want to attract them. Believe me.
   1131016|00000000||F-foglets? Ah, Sweet Mother Melitele, why'd I ever come 'ere…?
   1131011|00000000||Hey! Ye hear me?
   1131014|00000000||Anyone there?
   1131008|00000000||Kendrick? Kendrick!
   1125212|00000000||Talk to the wife.
   1104729|ef3c998f||Fire Swallower
   1127643|00000000||Very well, sir witcher. Show me what you've got.
   1127536|00000000||Go on! Give them hell! Massacre the fuckers, Geralt!
   1127641|00000000||Now that's fun! Just like the old times. When I was alive.
   1127618|00000000||Damned fine show, witcher. A feast for the eyes.
   1129278|00000000||My, my. Ornery whoresons, those von Everecs, eh?
   1129280|00000000||Who are you?
   1129282|00000000||The rogue you seek - Vlodimir von Everec, brother to Olgierd.
   1129285|00000000||Uh! Forgot I cannot even scratch my stones. Though in point of fact, they've not itched much since I died.
   1129287|00000000||Didn't want to fight your family. They started it.
   1129289|00000000||I'm dead, not blind. I preferred to see how you'd handle those snobby pricks. And grandmum, too. Besides, what harm could you do them…? They're dead as it is.
   1129291|00000000||Now tell me how you came into Olgierd's blood. If you hurt him, I fear I shall have to kill you.
   1129293|00000000||Got it from a… mutual acquaintance of mine and Olgierd's. I'm here on important business.
   1105116|00000000||I'm a swiving corpse. With no interest in important matters - yours or any other bugger's. The sole thing I miss is feasting, corporal diversions, so to speak, but alas…
   1105118|00000000||Folk come here often?
   1111232|00000000||Get a lot of visitors?
   1111234|00000000||At times, not often. For when someone does drop by, the whole band comes out to play.
   1111236|00000000||Fun-loving family.
   1111377|00000000||True. We're famed for our love of revelry and rumbles. We von Everecs have brawled and raided for generations. It's tradition.
   1111379|00000000||Naturally, with raids comes loot. So we always had the means to celebrate right lavishly.
   1111381|00000000||Towards the end of my life was when things went sour…
   1111383|00000000||But… no point poking at old wounds. Just days before I died, my brother claimed he'd found a way to dig us out, restore our state.
   1105117|00000000||Your brother sent me.
   1111387|00000000||Your brother sent me.
   1099070|00000000||Mentioned you like to enjoy yourself. Well, just so happens that's why I'm here. Your brother sent me.
   1092798|00000000||How is the old rogue?! Ehh, what I wouldn't give to ride by his side again…
   1105114|00000000||No chance of that happening. Could experience something else, though. Something a corpse should find interesting.
   1105132|00000000||Interesting? Out with it - what do you have in mind?
   1105134|00000000||Tell me about Olgierd.
   1105146|00000000||Listen, feels like I should know Olgierd better. Tell me something about him.
   1105148|00000000||Oh, a fantastic chap, a true cavalier. You won't find another like him in all Redania.
   1105150|00000000||The best there is for a drink or a brawl. We were pups when we started riding out on raids. Wet behind the ears.
   1105152|00000000||Borderland villagers shat their trousers at the very sound of the word "Olgierd." I was his second-in-command, leading a band of rogues who'd ride through fire for us.
   1105154|00000000||Sound like common bandits. Any difference?
   1105156|00000000||Us?! Bandits?! Watch your words. True, some of our swordsmen were mindless brawlers, but not Olgierd.
   1111414|00000000||Always curious, took an interest in all things. He devoured books, adored paintings… and loved the most beautiful maid in the world.
   1111398|00000000||How'd you die?
   1111416|00000000||Don't mean to pry, but… just a little curious how you died.
   1111418|00000000||Bah, no need to be shy. Folk love such stories. I'd love this one, too, were it not to end with my death.
   1111420|00000000||So, how'd it happen?
   1111422|00000000||On raids, it was our custom to storm the ealdorman's hut, then order the local clods to bring us kegs of spirit…
   1111401|00000000||…And provide willing wenches to squeeze and churn about.
   1111403|00000000||Then, sadly, an ambush. Outmanned five-to-one, we were overwhelmed. They killed me. Crushed my skull like an eggshell between an upturned oak table and the stone floor.
   1105133|00000000||Supposed to show you the time of your life.
   1111785|00000000||Listen, Olgierd gave me a job. Odd as it may sound, I need to show you the time of your life.
   1111787|00000000||Is that so?! Now that, sir, is a brother! I've been dead for years, yet he still looks after me, after my spirits!
   1111822|00000000||How much time do we have?
   1111824|00000000||Think one night should do the trick.
   1111826|00000000||Splendid!
   1111790|00000000||Wait just a moment while I hoist my saber and--
   1111792|00000000||What the blistering devils…?!
   1111794|00000000||You're a ghost. Can't grab things.
   1111796|00000000||Argh, I keep forgetting. But how am I to revel and ruck and fuck?! Can't lift a tankard to my lips! Can't wield a saber! Can't squeeze a wench as we dance a jig!
   1111798|00000000||Guess you'll have to do without. Let's go.
   1111800|00000000||I will go nowhere.
   1111802|00000000||You're to see I enjoy myself, correct? Well, then think of a way to make it possible.
   1111806|00000000||How?
   1111808|00000000||Revive my flesh.
   1111810|00000000||No can do. Besides, body's probably decomposed.
   1111812|00000000||Then bloody come up with another way. I'll not go anywhere in this state.
   1111829|00000000||Hm. Guess I could bring someone here… and you… you could… hm… borrow their body. Just for the night.
   1111831|00000000||You wish me to possess someone?
   1111833|00000000||Uh… yeah.
   1111839|00000000||Hm. Say I agree - whose body would I inhabit?
   1111841|00000000||Dunno. One of Olgierd's men, maybe? Or a peasant who'd agree to do it for coin.
   1111843|00000000||Oh, no, no, no. I shan't crawl into the skin of some unwashed bandit or dung-eating swineherd!
   1111845|00000000||I've a better idea.
   1111803|00000000||Guess I could bring you someone to possess.
   1111804|00000000||Stop complaining, let's go.
   1111847|00000000||Come on, we're wasting time.
   1111849|00000000||I'm not to waste time? Sir, time is all I've left.
   1111851|00000000||You this big a pain in the ass when you were alive, too?
   1111853|00000000||Do not anger me, boy. If I've but one night, I want to revel properly, not watch others enjoy themselves.
   1111903|00000000||So what do you propose?
   1111905|00000000||I've an idea.
   1111900|00000000||Oh, no. Not gonna happen.
   1111902|00000000||Oh, yes. Yes it is.
   1092804|00000000||Geralt! Wake up! Open your eyes! Where are the smelling salts…?
   1092806|00000000||Death was a small price to pay to lie on a lap so lovely… and so near the wonders concealed a bit higher.
   1092808|00000000||Have you gone mad?
   1099120|00000000||Yes. As soon as I laid eyes on you. Promise to stay and stroke my chin and I shall spend the rest of eternity in a hound's body, trodding along by your well-turned calves.
   1099122|00000000||Geralt! What's happened to you?!
   1099124|00000000||Geralt? I'm Vlodimir.
   1111907|00000000||What?
   1111909|00000000||Blast! Fine, fine, give me a moment.
   1112007|00000000||Yeah. Definitely don't like being possessed.
   1112009|00000000||You'd not have fainted had you not resisted so fiercely.
   1111912|00000000||Geralt. Care to explain what's going on here?
   1111933|00000000||It's his fault.
   1111935|00000000||A pleasure to meet you, my sweet.
   1111937|00000000||Whose?
   1111939|00000000||His. You know, Olgierd's brother.
   1111913|00000000||It's Olgierd's brother's fault.
   1111914|00000000||Sorry about that, Shani.
   1111944|00000000||Sorry about that, Shani. That wasn't me.
   1111946|00000000||So who was it?
   1111950|00000000||Me.
   1111952|00000000||Shut up.
   1111954|00000000||I didn't say anything.
   1111956|00000000||Sorry, wasn't talking to you.
   1111958|00000000||Who to, then?
   1111960|00000000||Well, to him. To Vlodimir.
   1111941|00000000||Geralt, there's no one else here.
   1111962|00000000||Seems your lovely maiden friend can neither see nor hear me. Hm, there's potential in that.
   1111988|00000000||Leave Shani out of this.
   1111990|00000000||Ah, is that her name? Lovely! A perfect name for a perfect lass!
   1111985|00000000||Leave her out of this.
   1111986|00000000||Let's set some ground rules.
   1111994|00000000||Need to set a few ground rules.
   1111996|00000000||And I needn't do a thing save have the time of my life. Which is exactly what I aim to do.
   1111992|00000000||You're testing my patience.
   1112000|00000000||As you are mine! Can you please explain what's going on here?!
   1112002|00000000||Ooh, fiery. Temperament matches the drapes.
   1112005|00000000||Listen, I'm supposed to show Vlodimir von Everec the time of his life. Turned out he's a ghost.
   1112011|00000000||So… willing or not, I gotta lend him my body.
   1112013|00000000||Wait a minute - are you saying you're possessed?
   1112015|00000000||Not at the moment. Just now he's standing next to me, coyly grinning at you..
   1112017|00000000||But off and on he'll enter my body. So anything I say or do will actually be him, his mind, his intent.
   1112019|00000000||Uh… What if I want to talk to you, not him?
   1112021|00000000||Huh. Well, she should approach me and ask me to jump out for a bit.
   1112023|00000000||Just come up and ask him to leave for a while.
   1112046|00000000||I see.
   1112048|00000000||Splendid.
   1112051|00000000||Right, then, sugarplum, what say you we leave this dank crypt? There's a charming grove nearby where kisses taste sweeter than anywhere else in the world.
   1112053|00000000||I take it you're Vlodimir now. Doesn't seem like I'll have trouble telling you apart from Geralt.
   1112138|00000000||The problem is, he turned me down.
   1112140|00000000||The crook-pated churl.
   1112142|00000000||Uh, don't call him that.
   1112144|00000000||What choice do I have when he is a churl? I'd never say no to as fair a face as yours.
   1112127|00000000||You see, I've a friend who's getting married. She invited me to the wedding, but I need an escort.
   1112129|00000000||I had hoped that when Geralt saw me weaving the garland for the wedding, he'd invite me, but, uh… well, I hoped wrong.
   1112131|00000000||Hmhmhm… all is not lost, pudding. I shall escort you! No better dancer in all Redania than Vlodimir von Everec!
   1113374|00000000||I must say, witcher, a man could lose his head for a lass like that.
   1113602|00000000||And that comes from none other than Vlodimir von Everec - famed for his taste in women.
   1113604|00000000||So tell me, honestly now, man to ghost - are you her paramour?
   1113606|00000000||For if so, you have my word I shall keep my distance. But if not, then… hohoho, the haylofts we shall devastate together…
   1113367|00000000||Only ever been friends.
   1107602|00000000||We're just friends. Always have been.
   1107606|00000000||Never professed your love? No heartfelt admissions, confessions?
   1107608|00000000||Never anything between us.
   1107604|00000000||You mean to say you never gripped those gorgeous-- Whohohuh.
   1113624|00000000||Never cherished those beautiful, nay, stunning-- So, soft in the head or the loins?
   1113626|00000000||Excuse me?
   1092468|00000000||Ahh, a pederast… Fine, if it's not your flavor, you needn't taste. All the better for me. I'll see she's properly satisfied.
   1113390|00000000||So, witcher, time for the wedding?
   1113630|00000000||Let's go.
   1113632|00000000||Onward. I'll be right behind you.
   1092466|00000000||Let's say we were more than friends… once upon a time.
   1096573|00000000||Hah! You tried to hide it, but I smelled a tryst! I know a thing or two about men, you see.
   1113628|00000000||A shame, though, I'd have satisfied her well. But no cavalier would rut in another's garden.
   1113366|00000000||Cared for Shani deeply once.
   1112148|00000000||Wonderful. I must stop by my home first and change, so we'll meet at the temple.
   1112152|00000000||Oooh, I don't like the sound of that.
   1112154|00000000||Why not?
   1112156|00000000||I'm not fond of temples, see. When alive I'd only set foot in one to loot it, and in death I find I despise them all the more.
   1112158|00000000||Could we not meet after the ceremony, go straight to the feast?
   1112302|00000000||Uh, all right. Seems we've no other option.
   1112389|00000000||Splendid! Hahahaha. Then I shall see you at the wedding manor!
   1112146|00000000||No better dancer in all Redania than Vlodimir von Everec! My ginger muffin, with me, you shall enjoy an evening to top all others!
   1112133|00000000||Just before Geralt entered the crypt to summon you, I invited him to my friend's wedding.
   1112135|00000000||Good heavens! That's damned good luck!
   1112069|00000000||I'm afraid I have to turn you down, dear ghost.
   1112071|00000000||A shame. In that case, point me to the nearest brothel!
   1112073|00000000||I've got a better idea.
   1112057|00000000||My sentiments exactly. Between you and me, this witcher fellow is an awful bore…
   1112059|00000000||Hahaha! Only sometimes.
   1112063|00000000||Hah! Seems we're kindred spirits. So, off to the nearest hedgerow?
   1112054|00000000||Geralt's a bore.
   1112055|00000000||Don't change the subject, darling.
   1112061|00000000||Don't change the subject, my sweet. If a grove's not to your liking, we can cut straight to the chase and make for the nearest haystack.
   1128279|00000000||Spooking my horse. Roach doesn't like ghosts.
   1092855|00000000||This whole witcher's life - what's it like?
   1099149|00000000||Don't want to know.
   1099151|00000000||If indeed I didn't, I'd not have asked. Go on, tell me.
   1092857|00000000||You wouldn't like it.
   1105379|00000000||Why do you paw through my ancestor's bones?!
   1105381|00000000||On your way - leave the dead to rest in peace.
   1127517|00000000||See what they're doing? Marking down caravan routes.
   1127519|00000000||Those scribbles mean many a wagon will not make its destination.
   1127522|00000000||You realize how much fisstech they have here?
   1127524|00000000||You could buy half of Temeria.
   1105390|00000000||Are you a witcher or a scavenger?! Hands off the family heirlooms!
   1105392|00000000||Shut up. I do what I want.
   1092847|00000000||A comely maid. You're quite the fool if you've not ploughed her yet.
   1092849|00000000||Keep your paws off her.
   1099146|00000000||I'm to enjoy myself. Can I help it that I best like tumbles in the hay with fleshy lasses?
   1127540|00000000||My, my - bloody impressive treasures.
   1105817|00000000||I remember that mill. Whenever Olgierd and I got up to mischief, we'd hide out in there.
   1105819|00000000||Once we snuck off with some moonshine. Old cocksucker Yaromir caught us, heheh. Ah, those were the days.
   1127695|00000000||I'm in the mood for fun. You've no notion how long it's been since I fondled a perky pair. Let's go to this wedding.
   1127697|00000000||This wedding - we will go there soon, yes?
   1105402|00000000||Bloody fine mount. Good stance, powerful rump, stable withers… Well, well.
   1121681|00000000||See you know your horses.
   1121683|00000000||I should say so! My two greatest passions in life - mares and maidens, heheheh!
   1127802|00000000||I detest spiders. The creepers make my sphincter shut tight.
   1127512|00000000||A small graveyard and a white chapel. I know this place. The ealdorwoman hanged herself from a dried out bough.
   1127514|00000000||Ah, ages past, that was. I was but a lad.
   1127532|00000000||So this is what's become of the Flaming Rose's fallen petals. Heheh.
   1127534|00000000||They're churning out clouds of fisstech. Air's thick with it.
   1127652|00000000||Fat fucking beast.
   1127538|00000000||Careful, or the buggers will eat you. And that would ruin my fun.
   1092859|00000000||Those Signs - I'd like to try one.
   1099153|00000000||What Signs?
   1099155|00000000||Your witcher Signs. Never done it. Could be interesting.
   1092861|00000000||Rather not waste any time.
   1099157|00000000||Till the stroke of midnight what I would rather is what matters.
   1127542|00000000||My nose tells me they hid some treasure here. I've a very trusty sniffer.
   1127527|00000000||Charming spot. Scaled monstrosity's made itself a lovely nest.
   1127599|00000000||There's something there, Geralt. Beyond that wall.
   1092863|00000000||You meander, why? I was to have a good time, not wander about like a knight-errant.
   1099159|00000000||You want to be a witcher, so you need to survey the terrain. Know which way the wind's blowing.
   1092865|00000000||Just don't drag me into any brawls with beasts, mind you. With men - have at it.
   1127788|00000000||Grave robber. Tried to crawl in through the well, broke his neck.
   1127790|00000000||Meaning the scabby runt wished to rob our family crypt.
   1140029|00000000||Hmm. Probably shouldn't touch that.
   1093146|00000000||Wha… what's going on?
   1097676|00000000||Ah, he's finally come to. And he can speak human, turns out.
   1097687|00000000||Started thinkin' I'd not converse in Common the whole way. 'Cept maybe with me reflection in the piss bucket.
   1097678|00000000||Where… where am I?
   1097680|00000000||On the "Albatross." Or the "Phakbarthojl," as their strange tongue has it. En route to Ofier.
   1097721|00000000||Don't remember signing on as a sailor.
   1097723|00000000||Haha, oh, you didn't, mate. They dragged you aboard. Seems you killed their prince.
   1104778|00000000||Shit. Means I'm in trouble.
   1104790|00000000||Oooh… Toad in the sewers. Dammit.
   1104794|00000000||Should consider myself lucky, I guess. Coulda killed me on the spot.
   1098269|00000000||Tried to break out yet?
   1098275|00000000||Beh! Used every ounce of charm I got, and nothin' doin'. Might be my Ofieri's rusty.
   1098290|00000000||My Ofieri's non-existent.
   1106772|00000000||Well, we'll be at sea at least a month. Could teach you some in that time.
   1106780|00000000||Elkhahl! Ohrijahle!
   1098296|00000000||What's that mean?
   1106782|00000000||Told us to shut up.
   1097734|00000000||There's been a misunderstanding. Can I talk to your captain?
   1097737|00000000||Elkhahl, sokhan. Ghalaveth kharh u albahta a'ghell.
   1097744|00000000||Quiet, dog. You killed our prince and you'll pay for that.
   1104774|00000000||Gyhle'am vallarh, quar verrethe ner.
   1112458|00000000||Were it up to me, you'd be dead already.
   1104839|00000000||Revhaghr ner'am ea kharher, Annar. Dhorgatte ye'allami.
   1112460|00000000||Vengeance is not ours to reap, Annar. It's the king's. We swore on our honor.
   1112462|00000000||How do I say "Take me to your captain"?
   1112464|00000000||Vhajlth alle'khe uhl eghullath.
   1112466|00000000||What?
   1122560|00000000||Elkhahl!
   1106788|00000000||V… Vhajlth…
   1097758|00000000||Elkhahl! Inhkal avr ikhell urgherevng aul vihter.
   1097747|00000000||…alle'ghe urh yghilleth!
   1097752|00000000||Vhajlth… alle'ghe urh yghilleth!
   1097760|00000000||Insh'avahl kho llayath.
   1112472|00000000||What just happened? What'd he say?
   1112484|00000000||Said to sit quiet. And that you'll hang in two weeks.
   1112490|00000000||And then he added something like, "We'll see who's in the mood for jokes, then."
   1112492|00000000||Why? What did I say?
   1112495|00000000||Heh. Along the lines of "I want your nose bouncy-bouncy!". Utter nonsense.
   1097748|00000000||…alle'khe uhl eghullath!
   1097754|00000000||Vhajlth… all'khe uhl eghullath!
   1112497|00000000||Great.
   1097782|00000000||Give it a rest. No point talkin' to that lot. All you get's angry gurgles. And they puff up, you notice? Like them fish, uh, what's it they're called…?
   1097852|00000000||There anyone here who speaks Common?
   1097854|00000000||Uh, there's this mercenary with them. Looks Aedirnian to me. He's the one recruited me to show 'em through the sewers.
   1112503|00000000||Oh, and the mage what leads them knows a bit. Heard him talkin'. But I doubt either'll talk to you.
   1104776|00000000||Ah, I was you I'd catch some shut-eye, not go on flappin' me tongue. Got a long voyage ahead.
   1097860|00000000||Sleep's not what I need. Someone I could actually communicate with, that's what I want.
   1097874|00000000||Greetings, Geralt. Remember me?
   1097876|00000000||No.
   1098304|00000000||Not really.
   1098321|00000000||Gaunter O'Dimm, known also as Master Mirror. We met in White Orchard - I helped you find your… Yennefer.
   1098311|00000000||We meet again. And it seems you need my help. Again. Heard a noose awaits you.
   1098496|00000000||That is… if this slop doesn't kill you first.
   1098498|00000000||What are you doing here?
   1098331|00000000||How'd you get in here?
   1098467|00000000||Long story, it'd bore you. I'd prefer to focus on something more useful - like getting you off this ship.
   1098619|00000000||Who you gabbin' with?
   1098621|00000000||Wi-- No one.
   1098623|00000000||Ah, never liked boats. Not one bit.
   1098625|00000000||They heave like devils, make me stomach churn.
   1135153|00000000||Ah, it'd be prime to sleep through the whole thing and wa--
   1098482|00000000||Because you do wish to disembark, do you not?
   1098484|00000000||Yeah, sure. But what on earth could you--?
   1098642|00000000||Oh, more than you'd ever expect. I shall help you, Geralt. But before I do, I must know you'll return the favor.
   1127830|00000000||Right. Can't possibly get something for nothing.
   1127832|00000000||Indeed. When all's said and done I am a merchant. So, do you want my help?
   1127834|00000000||Yes.
   1127836|00000000||It's a deal. Once it's all over, we shall meet at midnight at the crossroads 'neath the willows near the village of Yantra.
   1126224|00000000||Ah, and I must give you something - to remember me by.
   1126227|00000000||Ssss! What's that?
   1126229|00000000||A mark to show we're… associates.
   1098528|00000000||Haven't tried it yet.
   1098530|00000000||Hm. Doesn't look promising. Not unlike your situation. I could try to extract you from here, you know.
   1098497|00000000||Haven't tried it yet.
   1098302|00000000||I remember. We met in White Orchard. You're…
   1098317|00000000||Gaunter O'Dimm, known also as Master Mirror. I helped you find your… Yennefer.
   1097875|00000000||Yes.
   1112494|00000000||That you wanted his auntie's hat. That was the gist, anyroad.
   1097750|00000000||Vhajlth… alle'khe yhll eghallith!
   1097746|00000000||…alle'khe yhll eghallith!
   1097718|00000000||There any way out of here?
   1097827|00000000||And who might you be?
   1098199|00000000||Phelippe Calagrande at your service. Petty thief, professional fence, and your guide about Oxenfurt when I've a bit of time.
   1098201|00000000||Mhm. And why're you here? You kill a prince, too?
   1098203|00000000||Well, to their thinkin', I had a hand in this one's death. See, I was their guide. Led them down into the sewers, but not until after you'd cut their prince's gut open.
   1098235|00000000||Sorry about that.
   1098237|00000000||Not your fault, mate. When all's said and done, could've sat on me arse in the Alchemy playin' gwent. Didn't have to brag about knowin' Oxenfurt better than me own breeches.
   1097719|00000000||Who are you?
   1123304|00000000||Listen, there was a young woman, a medic. Red hair. They capture her too?
   1123306|00000000||Don't recall seeing anyone of the sort. You were alone.
   1123308|00000000||Good. Means she managed to flee. Hopefully made it home.
   1123302|00000000||What about Shani? She here?
   1097813|00000000||We been sailing long? Where are we?
   1097815|00000000||We been at sea long?
   1097819|00000000||Hmm, dunno, rightly. Not that long. Though, on the other hand… But what's it matter, anyroad?
   1106770|00000000||Matters a lot. If they're hauling me off to hang me, I'm not in a hurry to arrive.
   1097821|00000000||Me, I'm glad to be sailin' to Ofier. I hear they got wild horses there, white with black stripes. Always wanted to see one o' them.
   1097823|00000000||Sure they're not black horses with white stripes?
   1097825|00000000||Nay, black horses with white stripes they've got in Zanguebar. That I'm sure of.
   1104796|00000000||Depends how you look at it.
   1104798|00000000||Happen to know a bit of Ofieri. Heard them sayin' they'd come here on a mission. Dispatched by their king to find their prince, lift his curse.
   1104800|00000000||Wagered their honor - and that of their families five generations back - that they'd bring him home, safe and sound.
   1104802|00000000||And I killed him. Great.
   1104804|00000000||So, must think they can save their honor by bringing the prince's murderer back - to face the king's justice.
   1104788|00000000||Dammit. Don't remember a thing. Just some sewers, a giant toad, then some boots…
   1104792|00000000||If that toad was their prince, guess I'm lucky to be alive.
   1104777|00000000||Don't remember a thing.
   1113447|00000000||Ah, my kind of tune! Let's do some dancing!
   1113449|00000000||In my experience, witchers and dancing don't exactly mix.
   1113451|00000000||Today they mix like fire and oil, my love! We'll dance the barn down!
   1113482|00000000||Faster! Faster! Till we expire!
   1113551|00000000||And now, a special treat for our special guests - the witcher Geralt and his enchanting partner, Shani. Musicians, something lovely for the loving couple…
   1113553|00000000||At last, music for a loving embrace!
   1113555|00000000||Come, Shani. It's time you discovered my romantic side.
   1113559|00000000||Huh. You're rather good at this.
   1113574|00000000||A chair could dance a jig with you as its partner!
   1113576|00000000||Oh, how humble you are.
   1113578|00000000||I strive to be. Yet should the need arise, I can strut as proud as any peacock.
   1113580|00000000||Oh, the perfect combination. Women must love you.
   1116378|00000000||Well, not to brag, but…
   1116380|00000000||Call it idle curiosity, but… how many have you had?
   1113582|00000000||Many. And not a scrub hag among them, I should add. Women with true class, all - though none to match your charms.
   1113561|00000000||You're quite skilled yourself.
   1113584|00000000||Not a man here who could out-dance me. It's a gift, my legs are preternaturally skilled.
   1113586|00000000||I never expected the members of Olgierd's band to have a taste for dancing.
   1113588|00000000||Yet it's so! We'd dance and dance - at every opportunity. As fond of fun as fighting - our motto!
   1113562|00000000||I am the lord of the dance.
   1113560|00000000||My dancing skills are a mere foretaste.
   1113564|00000000||They say dance is a mere foretaste of… hmm… more intimate interaction.
   1113566|00000000||Who says this?
   1113568|00000000||I do, for one.
   1113570|00000000||I do wonder what you mean by "intimate interaction."
   1116313|00000000||Ohhh, it's a fascinating process. One you, as a scholar and medic, might find especially interesting.
   1116315|00000000||I'd gladly explain it in detail, but it's horribly loud in here…
   1113572|00000000||Hmm… see the ladder? Leads to a loft. Surely there we'd not be disturbed while investigating the nature of intimate interaction.
   1101388|00000000||I couldn't resist.
   1101411|00000000||Don't be upset, my peach. I couldn't resist.
   1101413|00000000||I'm not upset. Just, next time don't lunge at me like that.
   1109892|00000000||I'd had a long fast, so to speak. Hunger overwhelmed me. But yes, next time I shall ask.
   1109894|00000000||Shani, may I kiss you?
   1116448|00000000||Hahahaha! You're incorrigible.
   1109888|00000000||Was it good for you?
   1101423|00000000||Yes, yes… but admit it - it was fantastic, eh?
   1101425|00000000||Is there anything you do that's not fantastic?
   1101427|00000000||The ladies loved my kisses. Not to mention the other tricks I perform with my lips.
   1101429|00000000||Yes, we'd best not mention those.
   1112319|00000000||I'd probably have done exactly what he did.
   1112321|00000000||Probably I'd a done what he did. Still like to…
   1112323|00000000||Then why don't you? Well? Answer me!
   1112325|00000000||Thing is, normal folk don't act like Vlodimir von Everec.
   1112327|00000000||Because they are churls.
   1112329|00000000||Don't be too hard on him. All in all, he's actually rather fun.
   1113548|00000000||Hah! See that? I'm fun! And you've got a pike so far up your arse, you can't wear hats!
   1101403|00000000||Wouldn't force myself on you.
   1101409|00000000||Well, I probably wouldn't 'ave forced myself on you.
   1113540|00000000||Forced myself?! It was an innocent kiss, naught more!
   1101415|00000000||I don't know if I should thank you or if that should make me… angry.
   1101417|00000000||Don't get me wrong - I've thought about doing just that a few times, but…
   1101435|00000000||But what?
   1101437|00000000||But I'm not going to talk about it with him here. We can discuss it once he's gone.
   1101439|00000000||I'll hold you to that.
   1113542|00000000||Perhaps a bit of thanks is in order? Seems I've snared the little robin for you.
   1116456|00000000||You can shut up now.
   1113771|00000000||Whoa! Hold there, mate! You said you weren't interested back in the crypt. Now, suddenly, after I've beat the cream all night, you swoop in to dip your berry? And aim to delight in it without me present?
   1116450|00000000||Shut up.
   1116452|00000000||What's going on now?
   1116454|00000000||Nothing. Never mind.
   1116477|00000000||Beh, I was to make merry, carouse, yet here I've stood the last five minutes listening to you talk. I'm going back in.
   1116480|00000000||Ah, better! Come, Shani. The night beckons us not to jabber it away.
   1116458|00000000||Happen to see the man who announced our-- your song?
   1116460|00000000||Yes, he acted as though he knew me, but we've never met. I was surprised. Who is he?
   1116462|00000000||Gaunter O'Dimm. Master Mirror. Wonder what he's doing here…?
   1120214|00000000||Then perhaps you should just ask him.
   1118747|00000000||Yeah. He didn't show up without a reason. Need to talk to him.
   1119888|00000000||Considered that he might have simply been nearby and dropped in on a whim?
   1119890|00000000||Promise you this much - he never does anything simply. And certainly not on a whim.
   1101405|00000000||Can't say what would've happened. Probably wouldn't have danced at all.
   1101407|00000000||Oh, really?
   1113536|00000000||Shut up, shut up! You'll ruin everything!
   1101431|00000000||At any rate, I wash my hands of all my actions till the stroke of midnight.
   1101433|00000000||I see.
   1101402|00000000||Wouldn't do it. Not my thing.
   1109897|00000000||Could I talk to Geralt for a moment?
   1109899|00000000||What for? He'll have nothing of interest to say. The man's a drip.
   1109901|00000000||Please?
   1109924|00000000||Very well.
   1113544|00000000||See how I've reeled her in? Now don't fuck this up.
   1109927|00000000||Geralt, I'm curious what it's like when that ghost's inside you. Do you feel anything? Have any control?
   1109929|00000000||I feel everything. Don't have any control over what I do or say, though. Why do you ask?
   1109931|00000000||Because I wonder what it would've been like to dance with you. Just you.
   1101391|00000000||What do you mean, hands to myself? That'd be no fun at all. Besides, I thought you too would enjoy it.
   1101393|00000000||Oh, I like to kiss… and get kissed. But mostly with one person at a time - and there's two of you in there.
   1101395|00000000||Aye, yet only one did what set your heart aflame. Me.
   1101397|00000000||Aaaaa…
   1101387|00000000||If I'm to play, I will play.
   1113590|00000000||Seems the music and the evening draw to a close. Know how a true dancer thanks his lovely partner?
   1113592|00000000||I'm… not sure I do.
   1116384|00000000||What're you doing? Have you lost your mind?
   1137590|00000000||I have! My mind, my heart - for you.
   1137592|00000000||We must agree - you can say whatever you please, but you shall keep your hands to yourself. Understood?
   1137664|00000000||Look there, Shani. The ladder begs us to scamper to its top, where we can… converse.
   1137666|00000000||Then let us scamper.
   1137669|00000000||But… how so? Just like that?
   1137671|00000000||There aren't that many ways to scale a ladder.
   1123400|00000000||The night is young. Come, let's do something wild!
   1137695|00000000||But… what's just as you thought? I find you intimidating!
   1137697|00000000||Loudly lowing cows only ever give a little milk.
   1137699|00000000||I've only ever dealt with simple maids. Whereas you're a surgeon!
   1137701|00000000||I believe I was right not to just take you and, well-- I was right to take the more romantic approach.
   1137703|00000000||Oh, all right. Now come. We were to enjoy ourselves. Let's do just that. Romantically…
   1137674|00000000||Let's sit. Come now.
   1137676|00000000||Just… like that?
   1137679|00000000||I'm all ears. What would have us talk about? I'm sorry - converse about.
   1137681|00000000||Well… when it comes right down to it…
   1137683|00000000||Yes…?
   1137685|00000000||You see… the thing is…
   1137687|00000000||Come now, spit it out.
   1137689|00000000||Akhem. I…
   1137692|00000000||Yes, just as I thought. Come, it's time we returned.

   1124240|00000000||Having completed all of Olgierd von Everec's wishes, Geralt went to the Alchemy Inn, where he was to meet with the ataman's representative...<br>
   1124239|00000000||With Shani's help, Geralt managed to enter the Academy grounds and speak to a Professor Shakeslock, who had earlier helped Olgierd in his attempts to break the pact with Master Mirror. The professor revealed that O'Dimm could be cheated – one needed only propose a wager, and, as an inveterate gambler, he was ligely to agree to take one up on it.<br>
   1124241|00000000||Geralt took Professor Shakeslock's advice and proposed a wager to Master Mirror. Mirror agreed, but only if it was played out on his terms. He transported Geralt to a strange, dark world and made him solve a riddle. Geralt, who has always had a keen mind for such puzzles, soon found the solution and defeated Gaunter O'Dimm. Was this the last our world will ever see of him? No man can say... <br><br>What mattered most at the moment, however, was that Olgierd von Everec was safe, and the pact which had bound him had been dissolved.<br>
   1124242|00000000||Geralt decided not to dispute the arrangement between Gaunter O'Dimm and Olgierd. The pact was fulfilled, and Olgierd's life came to an end.<br>
   1143297|00000000||To Geralt's surprise, he found Master Mirror waiting for him there. So that they might chat undisturbed, Mirror raised a hand and... stopped time. If prior to this Geralt had had any doubts O'Dimm was a demonic creature, this act – and the dark talk that followed – surely erased them.<br><br>Mirror made it clear Geralt had no choice but to see their bargain through to the end. Whether as an implied threat or just for some twisted fun, O'Dimm then killed a nearby man... with a spoon.<br><br>Geralt knew he had to do as Mirror asked. First, however, he decided he should visit Shani, who, according to Olgierd's messenger, wanted to meet with him.<br>
   1108569|00000000||Meet Olgierd's man at the Alchemy Inn.
   1108570|00000000||Meet Olgierd at the Temple of Lilvani.
   1108571|00000000||Find the solution to Master Mirror's riddle.
   1121348|00000000||(Optional) Talk to Shani at her home.
   1124243|00000000||(Optional) Follow Shani to the Academy.

   1108644|00000000||Whatsoever a Man Soweth…
   1127808|00000000||I'm not a hired assassin.
   1127812|00000000||I'm a witcher. Not a man hunter.
   1127814|00000000||Kill an awful lot of them, though, don't you?
   1127816|00000000||When they deserve it.
   1127818|00000000||And my friend's murderer - he don't deserve it? At least hear me out!
   1127863|00000000||Need to think it through.
   1127865|00000000||Kluivert's got a scar on his forehead not unlike yours. Spot that, you'll know it's his body.
   1127867|00000000||Said I'd think about it.
   1127870|00000000||Know what, Puss Peeps? One look at a bloke and I know what he's made of. You'll do what I ask. I'd bet anythin' on it.
   1127873|00000000||Look for me in Oxenfurt! The Alchemy Inn on the main square!
   1127875|00000000||Find the bastard who did this. Find him and kill him. I'll pay top coin.
   1127820|00000000||Kluivert dealt fisstech. A few days past he rode to Bowdon - to take a delivery. Never came back.
   1128297|00000000||Been there? Actually seen his corpse?
   1128299|00000000||No, but Kluivert was one damned reliable whoreson. We was to meet, he didn't show. Can only mean he's dead.
   1127810|00000000||Keep talking.
   1127807|00000000||Keep talking.
   1127854|00000000||Seem able enough. Why not take care of this yourself?
   1127857|00000000||Why not avenge him yourself? Seems like you all relish swinging your sabers.
   1127859|00000000||Aye, we do. And if I knew who'd axed Kluivert, I'd 'ave gutted him ages ago. Thing is, I don't.
   1127861|00000000||But you see a lot with them puss peepers. You'll track him down.
   1125501|00000000||Hey you! Puss Peepers!
   1125503|00000000||Name's Geralt.
   1125505|00000000||But I'm gonna call you Puss Peepers. That a problem?
   1127804|00000000||Get to the point.
   1127806|00000000||Got an offer. Potentially lucrative, Puss Peepers. Someone's killed my mate. Name was Kluivert. You're to figure out who did it. Then cut the bugger's head off.
   1127877|00000000||Here to collect my coin.
   1127879|00000000||Came to collect my coin, not tell tales.
   1127888|00000000||Agh… So handsome and so borin'. Here, Puss Peeps - your gold. Ought to be enough for an ounce of panache.
   1127881|00000000||Bastards. Brethren of the Order of the Flaming Rose.
   1127883|00000000||What'd you do to 'em? Scald 'em with hot irons? Pick out their eyes? Skin 'em alive?
   1127885|00000000||No. Just killed them.
   1127876|00000000||Order of the Flaming Rose.
   1125633|00000000||Avenged your friend.
   1127851|00000000||Hahahaha! I knew you'd succeed, Puss Peepers! I knew it!
   1127853|00000000||Go on, out with it - who was the bastard?
   1125947|00000000||You're a right good chap, Puss Peepers.
   1125922|00000000||Oh, prefer not to be badgered just now.

   1113923|00000000||Geralt! Watch out!
   1113939|00000000||Oh! That must've 'urt.
   1113941|00000000||Drop the damn drifter, oi?!
   1113943|00000000||Come on, Geralt!
   1113937|00000000||Hang tough, Hans!
   1113920|00000000||Come on, Hans! Go for the kidneys!

   1111709|00000000||Huh. Air seeping through the cracks. Passage must be here. Now how do I open it?
   1111711|00000000||Nick of time. Now to get out of here.
   1111713|00000000||Sewers? Should've known.
   1122401|00000000||Hmm. Some spilled wine. Nothing else.
   1125574|00000000||Beautiful. But first blow would shatter them.
   1125576|00000000||Hm, this one probably also belonged to a sorceress… Fetish, maybe?
   1125645|00000000||From the collection of the mage Aeramas…
   1125647|00000000||Codex Redaniensis… Sole surviving copy.
   1125659|00000000||Hm. A giant's. Or maybe a jotun's.
   1125663|00000000||Lovely sculpture. Probably end up adorning somebody's garden.
   1125666|00000000||Zerrikanian spears. "Excellent adornments for any parlor wall." Heheh. Good to know.
   1125684|00000000||Letters must be old… String seems to say so, too.
   1125686|00000000||It was true love…
   1125661|00000000||"Goblet of Fire." Wonder what it is…
   1129128|00000000||Same paintings were on the block…
   1129130|00000000||Including this fine piece by van der Knoob, the master from Maribor.
   1129135|00000000||Guess this is where they store whatever doesn't sell.
   1129134|00000000||No buyers, I guess. Not really surprised.
   1111707|00000000||Redanians'll be here soon. Dammit, secret passage - where is it?
    303055|0037c652||Wolf
   1093431|00000000||Actually, I'm really just here to talk to Horst Borsodi.
   1093433|00000000||Oo. Might be more of a problem than ye'd expect.
   1095342|00000000||Because?
   1095344|00000000||An awful hermit, that one. Not a wee bit like his da, Melitele keep his soul…
   1095346|00000000||Buuut, Horst is like tae show his heid durin' the auction. I'll introduce ye then.
   1095348|00000000||Be mighty indebted to you.
   1095350|00000000||Think nothin' of it! I only ever collect on loans and promissory notes. All right, up we go!
   1093378|00000000||I really just wanna talk to Horst Borsodi.
   1093380|00000000||What'd folk come to bid on? Any idea?
   1093382|00000000||All kinds o' valuables, rare weaponry, exotica… But I've got my eye on a selection of canvasses by the master portraitists of the Maribor School - van der Knoob and Longendijk.
   1093384|00000000||Well, well. Never knew you to be a connoisseur.
   1093394|00000000||Cause I'm not! It's all muck and rubbage tae me. Point of fact, I'll just wrap 'em in paper and lock 'em in the vault.
   1095309|00000000||Why in the world do--?
   1095339|00000000||What do ye mean, why, Geralt? I've got to diversify my investments, dinnae I?!
   1093375|00000000||Any idea what might be up for bid?
   1093376|00000000||Hm, didn't the Borsodis have their auction house in Novigrad?
   1093396|00000000||Could've sworn the Borsodis' auction house was in Novigrad.
   1093398|00000000||It was, but they moved it. Ye see, Radovid offered Horst a preferential tax rate - zero percent.
   1093400|00000000||Hm. Pretty much unbeatable.
   1093402|00000000||Aye. And I've nae seen a purer example of the benevolent state!
   1093370|00000000||Appreciate the help.
   1093372|00000000||Twas nowt. I've always had a mind to seein' to old pals and clients!
   1095259|00000000||Business with you's a pure pleasure, Vimme.
   1095261|00000000||The dear departed wifie claimed the same.
   1095263|00000000||Ahah! Folk're assemblin' - auction's about to start. Time we went upstairs.
   1116442|00000000||All me exes burnt me breakfast!
   1116444|00000000||And breakfast's the meal I love the most!
   1127389|00000000||Hee-haw, hee-haw!
   1100348|00000000||The lock! Lovingly crafted! Two spring-loaded bolts, cylindrical plugs, dimeritium wards…
   1098816|00000000||I'm not interested. No one's interested. We go in. Geralt, you're at the fore.
   1098818|00000000||Why me?
   1100305|00000000||It's why I hired you! Now move! We've no time!
   1098814|00000000||A mighty fine "whoop" that was! A wee bit loud, aye, on account I had to add more fulminatin' silver than usual, but--
   1100358|00000000||Mhmm. Do or die…
   1111472|00000000||That's it. For now.
   1111470|00000000||Shit! As if I haven't seen enough excitement.
   1137583|00000000||A witcher shall soon be buried. The skies weep.
   1137587|00000000||You under the delusion you'll complete your tasks, live happily ever after?
   1137585|00000000||As lifeless and boring as a boulder at the roadside.
   1137773|00000000||Death holds no surprises.
   1137775|00000000||Goodbye, Geralt.
   1137777|00000000||Fail, and you'll not be back.
   1137581|00000000||That's a dangerous man you've chosen to deal with, witcher.
   1113026|00000000||While traveling near Novigrad, Geralt happened across the body of an unfortunate wretch who had stumbled into a cave full of arachnomorphs. In his pockets was a yellowed letter.<br>
   1113027|00000000||The letter told the truth – Geralt found the hidden treasure and kept a one hundred percent finder's fee for himself.
   1113478|00000000||The letter was from a thief informing his partner about where he had hidden their takings. To their great misfortune, the damp cave he had chosen was also home to monstrous spiders, who'd made the treasure's hiding spot the very heart of their lair…<br>
   1113485|00000000||Search the cave for a chest using your Witcher Senses.

   1125064|00000000||Oxenfurt, once a city of students, had been transformed by war into a city of soldiers. Redanian troops were everywhere – in every inn, shop and brothel, but, most visibly and annoyingly of all, on every street. Geralt had to find a way to reduce the number of patrols if the robbery was to stand a chance of success. He dug into his bag of witcher tricks and found just the thing – an alchemical mixture which, added to the soldiers' rations, would soon have half the Oxenfurt garrison out on sick leave...<br>
   1125065|00000000||The garrison cook turned out to be amenable to cooperation. He agreed to add the witcher's special sauce to his pot, making Geralt's task much easier.
   1125068|00000000||Use your Witcher Senses to eavesdrop on Redanian soldiers patrolling Oxenfurt to find out where to find their cook.
   1125070|00000000||Visit the garrison cook during the day and convince him to help you.

   1114941|00000000||Vaults are, as a rule, difficult to enter. Their metal-plated doors must either be teased open in silence by a skilled safecracker – or blown to smithereens by a demolitions expert. The unequalled master of the first method was Quinto, the best safecracker north of the Yaruga. The go-to specialist for the second was Casimir Bassi, a dwarf hailing from Mahakam.<br>
   1114942|00000000||Geralt chose to recruit Casimir to join his crew. Expecting to have to persuade the dwarf to abandon his idyllic family life, Geralt found himself instead convincing the dwarf to cling to any life at all. Abandoned by his wife, Casimir was set on exploding himself and his wrecked home in a spectacularly effective suicide – until he heard the witcher's offer.<br>
   1114943|00000000||Geralt decided on Quinto. Hans of Cidaris was holding the man captive, so Geralt first had to free him… though once he did, he had the impression the famed safecracker could have waltzed out of his prison at any time without his help. The ease with which Quinto opened his cell's lock boded well for his chances of cracking open the door to the Borsodis' vault.<br>
   1107499|00000000||Convince Casimir to take part in the robbery.
   1107500|00000000||Defeat Casimir.
   1107501|00000000||Go to the mercenaries' camp and talk to Quinto.

   1100815|00000000||Why, work of that sort would be a right honor, guv'nor.
   1099093|00000000||This way. Get out, witcher. And don't come back.
   1099089|00000000||Admire your courage, I do, but we need to figure something out.
   1099091|00000000||How? I was clear - I'll not hand you the House!
   1100778|00000000||No. Said you won't hand me its contents. I don't need those papers. Casket'll do me just fine.

   1100785|00000000||With immense pleasure. Believe me.
   1099083|00000000||Maybe we can make a deal.
   1100790|00000000||Yes, witcher. I'd sooner die than let you have those papers.
   1100761|00000000||Any? You sure?

   1100754|00000000||Of course. The witcher.
   1100756|00000000||I want Max Borsodi's House. Whatever it is.

   1096227|00000000||Ah, the Koviri School. Are you an Oxenfurt man?
   1096229|00000000||No. Know some folk who graduated from there, though.
   1095755|00000000||Rather talk about the notice.
   1096231|00000000||Too sober for that sort of conversation. Rather talk about the contract.
   1096346|00000000||Ah, a man of action - plain to see.
   1095753|00000000||Gotta admit I like it.
   1095760|00000000||I happen to like it. Especially the two ovoid forms.
   1096164|00000000||A jester. Good. I don't like men with no sense of humor. They bore me to death.
   1096622|00000000||Consider the beast gone.
   1096624|00000000||Confident. Bring me its head, and the reward shall be yours!
   1096338|00000000||I'll take the job.
   1096650|00000000||Admittedly curious about the monster. But got no time to go after it now.
   1096652|00000000||As you will. I shan't force you. Contract will find a taker in time - if not you, then another.
   1096654|00000000||But you change your mind, you come find me.
   1096571|00000000||Sorry. Not interested.
   1096340|00000000||Let's talk about the reward.
   1096575|00000000||Just one formality to resolve first - my pay.
   1096577|00000000||Never you mind that. Return with the beast's head and you'll have leave to take anything you wish from here.
   1096580|00000000||Awfully generous. Still, I'd prefer to agree a specific amount.
   1096582|00000000||Ooh, fine. How much would you like? Three, four hundred crowns?
   1096584|00000000||Four hundred and fifty.
   1096586|00000000||Agreed. And that'll be in addition to whatever memento you wish to take.
   1096633|00000000||Look who's come back! Come in, sit yourself down!
   1096636|00000000||Come to feast with us, or had a change of heart about the beast?
   1096460|00000000||Monster in the sewers - know anything more?
   1096321|00000000||I've no clue what it is. Only that it's deadly.
   1096327|00000000||I'd not have bothered had my cook not become its victim. Ooh, the way she prepared game… Had no equal.
   1096329|00000000||That why she was in the sewers? To fetch game?
   1096331|00000000||Nay, she went to a fair with a sister or cousin - matters not. Daft wench convinced her a prince transformed into a toad lives in the Oxenfurt sewers. And you know women - each craves a prince and will wade knee-deep through shite to get him.
   1096333|00000000||Vissy was no exception in that respect. Down she went, never to return. Wasn't the first, it seems, either.
   1096563|00000000||Hey! Leave her be!
   1096566|00000000||Is that any way to treat the lord of the manor's daughter?
   1096569|00000000||Apologies. Now where were we? Oh yes, the contract. So, you'll take it?
   1096380|00000000||The contract - let's talk.
   1096381|00000000||Celebrating anything special?
   1096447|00000000||This some special occasion, or just feel like feasting?
   1096449|00000000||Every occasion's special. Today, we celebrate a dubbing.
   1096451|00000000||Whose?
   1096454|00000000||Squire Herodore's new saber.
   1096456|00000000||I've hit on a name for her! Fair saber, I dub thee - Traditiana!
   1096458|00000000||Hahahahaha!
   1095749|00000000||Agh… I used to like Votticelli. The life he could breathe into a chunk of cold stone…
   1095751|00000000||But I look at it now, and it seems just a rock, ideally proportioned, not a flaw on its surface, painfully perfect.
   1126022|00000000||As lifeless and boring as a boulder at the roadside.
   1128476|00000000||Heheheh.
   1128478|00000000||That's better! More interesting, at the least.
   1096342|00000000||Very well, and now, to the matter at hand.
   1096344|00000000||Let's rejoin the company, partake of some refreshment first.
   1096351|00000000||Ataman Olgierd! Long may he live!
   1096354|00000000||Long live the ataman!
   1096356|00000000||Long live the ataman! Long live the ataman!
   1096358|00000000||Come and drink with us!
   1096360|00000000||Well, we haven't a choice, now.
   1096378|00000000||Fetch us some wine, dear. And a nibble or two!
   1096172|00000000||Sculpture isn't really my thing.
   1096174|00000000||Can't blame you. Contemporary art's become… superficial. And bland.
   1096176|00000000||A century on they'll be using just such nudes on placards to hawk bricks and other banalities. Mark my words.
   1095752|00000000||Sculpture's not my field of expertise.
   1127630|00000000||Got a bit more coin for you. Better be all you need.
   1127632|00000000||For tools it is enough, but ingredients rare also I req--
   1127634|00000000||Nope. Not gonna happen. Now lemme see what my coin's bought.
   1127616|00000000||Got the coin for master-level tools.
   1127385|00000000||Hard at work. Good to see.
   1130038|00000000||Ah, yes! Commissioned have I tools, a fitting set. From Novigrad crafters. Many arms and legs they charged, but renew my work in earnest I now can.
   1130040|00000000||New runes, glyphs and diagrams created I have. An eye you should cast, find one to your liking perchance.
   1130047|00000000||So, nothing holding you back now?
   1130049|00000000||From making master-crafted runes, you mean? Err, much more coin I will need to do so. Sadly.
   1137379|00000000||I might. First, got some painite for you.
   1055702|5ec210eb||Drowned Dead
   1127702|00000000||"The White Wolf", "the Butcher of Blaviken" – Geralt gathered many sobriquets on his Path, one of which was the colorful and, I dare say, apt, appellation of "Puss Peepers." This he gained during his adventure with Olgierd, when a cheeky young woman in Olgierd's company pinned him as the man best able to track down the scoundrel who killed her friend, Kluivert.<br>
   1128762|00000000||Kluivert had indeed been killed. Though much time had passed since the murder, the witcher hoped he could still find enough evidence to establish who was responsible.<br>
   1128763|00000000||It turned out Kluivert's death was not the work of common bandits or  deserters, but knights of the recently dissolved Order of the Flaming Rose. Geralt realized the brethren who had killed Kluivert were but part of a much larger contingent. To prevent any further such murders and fully avenge Kluivert, he would have to find the knights' leader.<br>
   1128764|00000000||The orders Geralt found on the knights he defeated not only shed light on their activities – they'd given up defending the defenseless and switched to brewing narcotics – but revealed the location of their hideout. Geralt decided to take a short break from monster hunting to pay their Grand Master a courtesy call.<br>
   1128765|00000000||The witcher and the Grand Master did not take a liking to each other. After a short talk about the Order's past and mission, they moved on to armed combat. This fight could clearly have only one outcome – Ulrich met the same fate as his infamous predecessor, Jacques de Aldersberg.<br>
   1128766|00000000||With this Geralt of Rivia, alias "Puss Peepers," avenged Kluivert and completed the task allotted him. He collected his promised reward and set off on his Path.<br>
   1128767|00000000||While crossing the war weary lands of the Northern Realms, Geralt came across an abandoned village, and lying within it – a corpse. Geralt knew his sharpened witcher senses would help him uncover who had committed this murder – then his sharpened witcher swords would help him punish the wrongdoers.<br>
   1128768|00000000||It turned out the murder had not been the work of common bandits or  deserters, but knights of the recently dissolved Order of the Flaming Rose. Geralt realized the brethren who had murdered the man were but part of a much larger contingent. To prevent any further such crimes, he would have to find the knights' leader.<br>
   1128769|00000000||The orders Geralt found on the knights he defeated not only shed light on their activities – they'd given up defending the defenseless and switched to brewing narcotics – but revealed the location of their hideout. Geralt decided to take a short break from monster hunting to pay their Grand Master a courtesy call.<br>
   1128770|00000000||The witcher and the Grand Master did not take a liking to each other. After a short talk about the Order's past and mission, they moved on to armed combat. This fight could clearly have only one outcome – Ulrich met the same fate as his infamous predecessor, Jacques de Aldersberg.<br>
   1128771|00000000||They say the world is small, and there's much truth to that saying, as Geralt found out when asked to find out who stood behind the death of Kluivert. The witcher could reply at once that it had been knights from the Order of the Flaming Rose, acting on orders from their commander, whose head he had recently lobbed off. Having completed his task before even being issued it, he collected his reward and returned to the Path.<br>

   1101868|00000000||Aye. We'd best.
   1137074|00000000||To this day, I do not know what caused Geralt to inquire after the contract posted by Olgierd von Everec. That famed witcher curiosity? An ominously light coin pouch? Or perhaps it was some other, more nefarious force… Whatever the impulse, Geralt decided to visit the locally-infamous nobleman and pursue the bounty on the sewer monster.<br><br>From their very first encounter, Geralt knew Olgierd was a unique character. He led an informal band who worshipped the ground he walked on, though he clearly was of a different sort than they: educated, a lover of art and an adherent to a certain noble code. Yet Geralt also perceived something indefinable within the man, something years later he would call "a void crying out to be filled."<br>
   1137075|00000000||Geralt later returned to the estate where he had first met Olgierd and his band – and found the place in flames. He soon learned the property did not in fact belong to Olgierd, but had merely been commandeered by the ataman and his men, who then went a touch overboard in their carousing. Olgierd did not begrudge them their pyrotechnic overexuberance, but the murder of the manor’s lord he considered one cruelty too far and ordered the wrongdoer beheaded. Geralt entered the stage in the middle of this execution. In the tumult that followed, he made a most startling discovery: Olgierd von Everec was immortal.<br><br>And immortality was but the start of the surprising revelations about Olgierd. Master Mirror revealed the two had signed a contract: in exchange for regaining his lost status and wealth, Olgierd had promised Mirror something very personal (what, exactly, Geralt did not yet know). This contract had a strange clause: before it could be considered complete and Master Mirror could collect his due, he had to fulfill three of Olgierd’s wishes. He could not do this personally, however, but needed instead to make use of a proxy. His choice for this role? Geralt, who in this way was drawn into a personal settlement between a powerful, immortal nobleman and the mysterious Gaunter O’Dimm.<br><br>Upon hearing Geralt would be the one to carry out his requests, Olgierd wasted no time and issued him his first challenges: to bring him the house of Maximilian Borsodi, and to show his brother Vlodimir the time of his life…<br>
   1137076|00000000||Granting Olgierd’s wishes had proven difficult but rewarding, for Geralt now knew a great deal more about the unusual nobleman – and the story that unfolded could have jerked tears from a cyclops.<br><br>Once upon a time, Olgierd fell hopelessly in love with Iris, a beautiful young lady from a well-off family. Her parents accepted his proposal of marriage and all seemed set for a happy ending when a storm of misfortune suddenly broke over the von Everec family. A chain of bad decisions and a few years of bad harvests had left the once-wealthy family deeply in debt. Then the Borsodis purchased this debt and, with their brutal enforcement of its terms, drove the von Everecs into utter bankruptcy. After this, Iris’ parents changed their mind about their daughter’s future husband, revoking their approval of Olgierd and betrothing Iris to an Ofieri prince who had come to study in Oxenfurt. Out of desperation, Olgierd turned to Master Mirror – and soon won back his coin, influence and, most importantly, his betrothed. All seemed well until he discovered his wishes’ unwanted side effect: his heart was slowly hardening into stone.<br><br>Now the witcher was on the verge of bringing the pact between Olgierd and Master Mirror to completion. Did this mean everything would soon be as it once was? Geralt was not so sure. One question kept nagging him: what was that “something very personal” Gaunter O’Dimm intended to collect from Olgierd?<br>
   1137077|00000000||Once Geralt realized Master Mirror was playing for the highest of stakes – Olgierd von Everec's soul – he decided he could not sit idly by. Instead he found a way to cheat the demonic being and win Olgierd back his soul. Free from his pact and his heart restored, Olgierd thanked Geralt and gave him his sword – a souvenir which had been in his family for generations – then walked off into the sunset.
   1137078|00000000||Geralt did not have to wait long to find out what lay at the heart of the contract between Olgierd von Everec and Gaunter O'Dimm. In exchange for regaining his family fortune, clearing his name and marrying Iris, Olgierd had agreed to give Master Mirror his soul. Geralt could now only watch as O'Dimm collected his due. Thus ended the sad tale of Olgierd von Everec, a man who lived as if there was no tomorrow, feasted as if he had never known joy and loved a love so strong he was willing to surrender his own soul for it.

In exchange for regaining his family fortune, clearing his name and marrying Iris, Olgierd had agreed to give Master Mirror his soul. Geralt knew of a way to stop this, but for some reason did nothing and instead watched as O'Dimm collected his due. Thus ended the sad tale of Olgierd von Everec, a man who lived as if there was no tomorrow, feasted as if he had never known joy and loved a love so strong he was willing to surrender his own soul for it.

   1113256|00000000||My valor stands on three pillars - good food, good drink and good fun.

   1104060|00000000||Know any master formulae?
   1104069|00000000||Know any advanced formulae, maybe something you could teach me?
   1104071|00000000||All I know I learned from Master Gremist of Skellige. Lookin' to apprentice yourself in the herbalist trade?
   1104073|00000000||Nah, just wanna learn something new.
   1104075|00000000||Call it what you will. You must sail 'cross the Great Sea, find the isle of Ard Skellig. There, in the Sacred Grove, the learned Master Gremist will judge whether you're fit to be his pupil.
   1104053|00000000||Greetings! Is it herbs you seek? Medicines to mute a bashful maid's inhibitions? Or a concoction to raise your own courage for a second go?
   1104055|00000000||That it? No other weeds or brews?
   1104057|00000000||Aye. One to make your hair grow, another to do the opposite. An easer of pain, a calmer of heartburn. Tell me what ails you.
   1137793|00000000||Huh. That was rather efficient.
   1137795|00000000||That all you got to say? I saved your life.
   1137797|00000000||Pff. We'd have disposed of that rabble easily.
   1137799|00000000||"We?"
   1137801|00000000||My, aren't we precise? You know what I mean! Are you here to trade or not? Hm?
   1137512|00000000||Hey there.
   1134757|00317413||Iris
   1136239|00000000||While wandering the lands to the northeast of Novigrad, Geralt came across a small camp of Ofieri travelers. One of these foreigners turned out to be a skilled runewright and enchanter, able to create runes and glyphs and enchant them into powerful words. Geralt was eager to make use of his services, but the runewright had lost his tools and rare materials. The witcher thus decided to provide the Ofieri the coin needed to reopen for business.<br>
   1136240|00000000||A small fortune was all it took for the Ofieri to get started. Once he received it, he got down to work and from then on Geralt could buy simple runes and glyphs from him and have him place basic words in his swords and armor.
   1142018|00000000||You can tell an experienced witcher by the way he examines a notice board. To the novice eye, these weathered planks contain nothing but clumsily-scrawled messages touching on matters thoroughly mundane: trifling announcements, offers of sale or purchase, lewd rhymes, et cetera, et cetera, ad nauseam. A witcher with years under his belt, however, will search the dross carefully, knowing that it often hides a jewel – a witcher contract, for example, or, as in this particular case, information about a mysterious "runewright" from a far-off land...
   1131841|00000000||Acquire 5000 crowns for the Ofieri runewright.
   1136504|00000000||Give 5000 crowns to the Ofieri runewright.

   1133948|00000000||Another day, another corpse -- and, the witcher suspected, another document revealing the tale of the deceased's demise. He was not mistaken.<br>
   1133950|00000000||Nicolas Vogel's laboratory notebook described the experiments the mad mage had conducted on harpies and also mentioned a hidden stash of coin. The chest's contents would be no use to Nicolas in the afterlife, so Geralt decided to secure them for himself.<br>
   1133949|00000000||He found the treasure chest atop the ruined tower. After emptying the thoroughly pecked container of its contents, the brave witcher continued on his Path.

   1117923|00000000||"Especially now, when an icy void grips my heart."
   1117926|00000000||"I see how you look at me, and I see you wither."
   1117929|00000000||"I cannot help you, but I believe I can cease harming you."
   1117931|00000000||"This letter and this rose are my farewell. May you live in health and remember but the good times."
   1117933|00000000||"Olgierd."
   1109710|00000000||We're almost at our journey's end.
   1109712|00000000||What's there?
   1117076|00000000||Iris von Everec's greatest fear.
   1085132|29134215||Gaunter O'Dimm
   1109618|00000000||Time to go to the wedding. Shani's probably already waiting.
   1109620|00000000||Agh. Vlod's ghost won't stop pestering me until he's had his fun. Time to head to the wedding.
   1109622|00000000||Geralt, old chap, mind turning your arse around and going back to the wedding? I was to have a bit of fun, not a bloody walkabout.
   1109624|00000000||Keep this up, and I'll get sore legs is all. Not quite what Olgierd asked for.
   1109626|00000000||Fine, we'll go back.
   1119048|00000000||Hideous creatures.
   1119050|00000000||You all right?
   1119056|00000000||Mh. Fine.
   1119052|00000000||Geralt! Are you all right?
   1119054|00000000||I'm fine. You? How'd you get in here?
   1119062|00000000||I told you. Vern had a key to the grate.
   1119064|00000000||I squeezed through those bars.
   1119066|00000000||Look, it's Franz.
   1119069|00000000||What's left of him, you mean.
   1119121|00000000||What kind of beast would do that?
   1119135|00000000||Doubt we'll learn anything else here. We need to find the lair.
   1119137|00000000||Right behind you.
   1119089|00000000||Need to find its lair.
   1119124|00000000||Hmm. Lotta drowners.
   1119126|00000000||Does that mean anything?
   1120864|00000000||Well, means our monster doesn't attack them.
   1119128|00000000||Seems they get along with whatever's prowling the sewers. Some kind of symbiosis.
   1119091|00000000||Hm. Wonder why there are so many drowners.
   1119090|00000000||[Examine the corpse.]
   1119093|00000000||Hm. Interesting.
   1119095|00000000||What?
   1119097|00000000||Franz had a leg wound, right?
   1119099|00000000||Mhm, just above the knee.
   1119101|00000000||Manage to apply anything to it?
   1119103|00000000||Yes, some spirit, but that was it. Why do you ask?
   1119105|00000000||Look - half of Franz's leg is gone. Monster must've chewed it off.
   1119107|00000000||Other bodies were untouched. Except for the wounds they sustained in battle.
   1119109|00000000||Are you suggesting… the beast likes alcohol?
   1119111|00000000||Mhm. Mixed with blood.
   1124741|00000000||What do you have to say…?
   1124953|00000000||Pier near the Western Gate. Should be easy enough to find.
   1124955|00000000||Hm. Need to brew the mixture first.
   1124957|00000000||Mhm. Must be the cook.
   1124975|00000000||Hm, a few drops and the boys at the barracks'll have a restless night…
   1125654|00000000||That's just it - certifiably insane. Didn't pass the tests, apparently.
   1125652|00000000||He mad, or what?
   1124941|00000000||Volunteered. Word is he had to bribe the medics to let him enlist.
   1124939|00000000||Lance Corporal Vatslav - how'd that prick wind up with us?
   1125656|00000000||But to pay hard coin to enter the army… Thought at my age nothin' could surprise me.
   1125680|00000000||Cook like that's a right treasure, he is. No gripin' about poor supplies. Just the gumption to enrich our gruel.
   1125678|00000000||No one. Came through the Western Gate the morn. Saw Maarten on the pier, rod in hand, fishin'.
   1124951|00000000||That true? Who told you?
   1124949|00000000||Mh, fish chowder for supper the day.
   1125682|00000000||Mh, aye. If only he'd go a bit lighter on the garlic…
   1130081|00000000||Nothing about the cook...
   1130083|00000000||Hmm... Nothing interesting.
   1125675|00000000||It can only bring trouble, mate, only trouble.
   1125673|00000000||Why the hell not?
   1125671|00000000||Trust me, you'd do better not to take any interest in the Borsodis.
   1125669|00000000||Well, think on it. To marry into a dynasty like that. It'd be like livin' in clover!
   1124947|00000000||Why do you ask?
   1124945|00000000||That, uh, Horst Borsodi - he got a daughter?
   1124983|00000000||Go on, now. We'd best not be seen together.
   1124989|00000000||Good day. Fish biting?
   1124991|00000000||Aye, they're biting.
   1125790|00000000||What about you?
   1125792|00000000||What's that?
   1125795|00000000||Got this mixture. Pay you to pour it in the soup for the boys at the garrison. On my signal. Nothing dangerous about it. Most they'll think is that the fish wasn't exactly fresh.
   1125798|00000000||It'll cost you, mate. Something dear.
   1125799|00000000||You'll help me free of charge.
   1125802|00000000||Asking a lot. Too much. How about you do this free of charge, huh? Out of the kindness of your heart?
   1125805|00000000||Aye, I'll help. Outta kindness…
   1125807|00000000||Wait for the signal. And mum's the word, understood?
   1124977|00000000||Fine. Here.
   1124972|00000000||Fine. Willing to pay.
   1124981|00000000||Know what? Be back later.
   1124973|00000000||We'll talk later.
   1124993|00000000||You're scarin' the fish away. Pay up or piss off.
   1117409|00000000||Give us some sugar, han'some!
   1117407|00000000||Eat, drink and be cheery!
   1127418|00000000||Oh, I'd gladly take that little ass for a romp.
   1114551|e2043c1c||Negotiator
   1098070|00000000||Master Casimir! Toss aside the torch, ee gads!
   1098100|00000000||Aaaaa, piss off then fuck off! Ye'll not tell me what to do!
   1098074|00000000||Wha-- What's going on here?
   1098076|00000000||Intit plain? Master Casimir's sat upon his roof. Claims he'll blow hisself to bits!
   1098572|00000000||Bought the wench pearls! Silks, satins! And how the fuck's she repaid me? Made me a heidbanger cuckold!
   1098080|00000000||Family troubles?
   1098092|00000000||Huh. A falling out in the family?
   1098094|00000000||Aye! His Euphemia, she were fine, pretty as a picture, you might say! An' five bairns they has.
   1098096|00000000||On the short side, but so well mannered! Always bow, ask after your health. Not at all grumpy like the ealdorman's laddies.
   1098098|00000000||Till the day Euphemia bundled up her belongin's and their bairns. Tossed 'em all on a wagon, and that's all we seen of her!
   1098597|00000000||Master Casimir's been pure yampy since - bawlin', whingin', now this!
   1098599|00000000||This'll be one for the ploughin' annals! Goin' out with a bang! When this fuckin' blows, they'll see the fires in Novigrad!
   1098079|00000000||Lemme talk to him.
   1098082|00000000||I'll try to talk some sense into him.
   1098084|00000000||An' if he should grow angered?
   1098086|00000000||Wench demanded a canopied bed! And got it! Silver tableware, she said! Got that, too!
   1098088|00000000||Lackin' nothin'! Not a thing! What the fuck else was I tae give her?!
   1098090|00000000||Doubt he can grow any angrier.
   1098607|00000000||Hail Melitele, our hallowed mother. Keep us from evil….
   1098103|00000000||What kind o' knob you got?! Likely come to poke my Euphemia, eh?! Well, ye're late! She's gone!
   1098105|00000000||No. I jus--
   1098107|00000000||Postmaster said the same! Denied it all, swore on the balls of his gods! And the eejit I am, I believed the bugger!
   1098111|00000000||Three years they bumped about under my nose! Then ran off! My granda told it right! Not a bloke out there doesnae want to get 'tween a dwarf wench's trotters!
   1098113|00000000||Set the torch aside. Let's talk this out.
   1098118|00000000||Care to set that torch aside? So we can talk this out? Calmly?
   1098824|00000000||Calmly?! Calmly?! Wench tossed me aside, took the weans, and I'm to be calm?!
   1098838|00000000||The country, she says! Fresh air's what I need, she says! So we came out here! Anythin' for my bunny!
   1098840|00000000||Cept 'stead of suckin' air, she sucked off the postmaster! In my ploughin' bed! I cannae take it no more!
   1098114|00000000||You're pathetic.
   1098120|00000000||Know what? You're pathetic.
   1098671|00000000||What?! What the fuck did you say?!
   1098673|00000000||You heard me. Wanna die? Go jump off a bridge. Instead of scaring folk shitless.
   1098675|00000000||Lookie here! Got us a clever one! Tellin' me how to off myself!
   1098677|00000000||Even willing to help you. No chance you'll do it on your own. You're not just a cuckold, you're a coward.
   1098679|00000000||Me?! A coward?! I'll not listen to this tripe! Don't ye go nowhere, ye bastart! I'll tie yer ball bag round your neck!
   1098845|00000000||Actually, got no reason to live. Blow yourself sky high.
   1098854|00000000||Agh, know what? Go ahead, blow yourself up.
   1098856|00000000||What did you say?!
   1098858|00000000||I see it now. You're fucked. If it's too much, if you're too soft, can't handle it, that's that.
   1098864|00000000||What?! Me, Casimir Bassi, mine foreman from Mahakam - soft?!
   1098866|00000000||Works out that way. No balls, forgot 'em somewhere.
   1098868|00000000||I've no--?! Me? No balls?! You just wait, ye rotter, ye scum bag, ye pricklicker! I'll show you!
   1098957|00000000||Come to think of it, doubt you're fit for the job. Not in that state.
   1098959|00000000||What?! I'm not fit?! What the fuck ye sayin' I'm not fit for, ye cocksucker?!
   1098961|00000000||I'd need you to blow something up, open. But--
   1098963|00000000||And I'm no fit for that?! Me, Casimir Bassi, top mine foreman in Mahakam?!
   1098965|00000000||More like top cuckold in Redania, now.
   1098967|00000000||Top--?! Cuck--?! Whaaaaat?! You wait, ye cur, ye rogue, ye dick heid! You just wait!
   1098928|00000000||Doubt you're fit to work, anyway.
   1098929|00000000||You'll find someone else. You're bound to.
   1098881|00000000||Forget about it. Listen, got a job for you.
   1098883|00000000||Forge--! Forget it?! Here I'm barin' my soul, and ye're gonna talk me up about work?!
   1098887|00000000||Ye're all the same! We dwarves, we're born tae muck about in the mines! Bend our necks 'neath human yokes! Ye dinnae give a duck's cock about it, ye ploughin' racists!
   1098852|00000000||Forget about it. Got a job for you.
   1098844|00000000||You'll find another.
   1098871|00000000||I'm sure you know the saying - plenty of fish and all. You'll find another.
   1098873|00000000||Another?! Is that yer take, that one wench'll do for another?! That I'll take any, so long as she's got a full beard?!
   1098875|00000000||No, but in my experience--
   1098877|00000000||Fuck yer experience! We're talkin' about my experience, mine! Agh, I've had my fill of this shite!
   1098879|00000000||No. No, wait!
   1098143|00000000||Relax. Let you know in due course.
   1098147|00000000||I'll let you know.
   1098149|00000000||What?! I was a minge hair from takin' my life. Now ye give me with the gab of a wench from personnel at a manufactury?! "Dinnae call on us, we'll call on you?!" Ye pure mad dafty?
   1099102|00000000||Now talk, and don't ye swick me! Ye givin' me the job or not?!
   1098153|00000000||Yeah, yeah - you got it. Now calm down.
   1098150|00000000||Yeah, you're hired. Welcome aboard.
   1098151|00000000||Changed my mind.
   1098155|00000000||Know what? Changed my mind. Think we'll both be better off--
   1098159|00000000||I'm of no use to a witcher, either. Argh! Shite luck, that. Shite life.
   1099106|00000000||Dammit.
   1098116|00000000||I commiserate, honestly.
   1098682|00000000||Aaah, talkin' out yer fanny flaps!
   1098684|00000000||No, no, seriously. I--
   1098686|00000000||Aye?! Seriously?! Couldn't give a hedgehog's arse for me or my troubles! Ye're as boggin' a liar as Euphemia!
   1098688|00000000||Think ye can dupe me with yer sweetened mincin', eh? Oh, no! No! That was that!
   1098691|00000000||Casimir, no!
   1098112|00000000||Really sorry.
   1098843|00000000||Get down. Now.
   1098969|00000000||Get down. Now.
   1098971|00000000||What? Aw-- Comin'. I'm comin'.
   1098133|00000000||Och. Aah! Ye bruised my bones, right splintered 'em!
   1098135|00000000||Sorry. Would've preferred to talk it out. Thing is, you gave me no choice.
   1098137|00000000||Nay, dinnae apologize. I needed somethin' o' the sort. Some fella tae knock the muck out o' my heid. Argh…
   1098130|00000000||Take that! And that, ye bugger! For Euphemia! For the weans! For the canopy!
   1099096|00000000||Stop! Stop it! Don't make me hurt you!
   1099099|00000000||Sorry. I was consumed, pent up, ye ken? Feel better, now. Laid my fists to a punchin' bag. Cooled off.
   1099060|00000000||So, uh, ahem - what is it you wanted?
   1099062|00000000||Want you to open a door. Permanently, so it won't close again.
   1099065|00000000||I see. And what might ye find on the other side of this door?
   1099067|00000000||A reward. Big one. To be split. Enough for everyone.
   1099075|00000000||If ye'd come a week past, I'd 'ave sent ye the fuck away. But now, now I've nothin' to lose. What's it I'm to do?
   1098142|00000000||Welcome aboard. Go to the herbalist's hut - you'll learn everything there.
   1098145|00000000||Hut of the herbalist who lives near Oxenfurt. Go there and ask for yarrow extract. Learn all you need to know. Clear?
   1099079|00000000||As a Mahakaman highland stream. See ya.
   1114948|00000000||Herbalist who lives near Oxenfurt. His hut. Go there and ask for yarrow extract. Learn all you need to know. Clear?
   1114950|00000000||And might you be headed there about now? 'Cause if so, we could head there together, eh?
   1114953|00000000||Hm, actually wouldn't mind some company for the slog.
   1115290|00000000||Aye, that! And I can teach ye a cheery tune what to keep the spring in our step! It starts like this…
   1114944|00000000||All in all, why not.
   1114945|00000000||Got something to tend to on the way.
   1114955|00000000||Need to tend to something on the way. So we'll meet there.
   1104952|00000000||Och… I cannae waiit to fuckin' blast it wide!
   1104954|00000000||Ach, if only my heart were whole and held dear. Maybe once I'm flush with coin?
   1114411|00000000||Gone batshit barmy, he has. I told youse it'd end this way!
   1114413|00000000||Fidelity, she swore! Love! What of it? Crushed heart, stones and cock, that's what!
   1118919|00000000||The mutant must perish!
   1118921|00000000||For the Eternal Fire!
   1118925|00000000||You can huff and puff all you want, wolf!
   1118927|00000000||Come now! Stop squirming.
   1118933|00000000||Die, die, die!
   1118923|00000000||I pity you, mutant.
   1118929|00000000||All as one, brothers!
   1118931|00000000||Aaah! We'll avenge thee, brother!
   1113007|00000000||Very well. I won't.
   1113009|00000000||So be it. If there's no demand, I shan't supply. But it would have been a beautiful speech.
   1113011|00000000||It's almost midnight, time for the capping.
   1113013|00000000||You're a bridesmaid, Shani - take your place.
   1116638|00000000||That was unduly harsh.
   1116649|00000000||Didn't have to make him suffer.
   1116651|00000000||Of course I needn't have.
   1127374|00000000||But I could.
   1116639|00000000||Thanks. He was starting to be a pain.
   1116655|00000000||Thanks, not sure I could've stood him much longer.
   1116657|00000000||At your service. Always.
   1116661|00000000||I hope you didn't hurt him.
   1116663|00000000||I disposed of a pest. There was no need for you to suffer his cheek any longer.
   1116677|00000000||Geralt had finished his task, you see, so--
   1116679|00000000||Yes, I know. As soon as he finishes one task, he needs to rush off to the next.
   1130060|00000000||Who knows, perhaps this time will be different? I saw you looking at each other. And it just so happens I also know the history you share…
   1130062|00000000||You do? How?
   1130064|00000000||Shani, darling… would you ask an eagle how it knows how to fly?
   1130066|00000000||Regardless… what matters is Vlodimir von Everec will bother you no more.
   1116681|00000000||I'd like to stay a bit longer.
   1102551|00000000||I'd like to stay longer… but…
   1102553|00000000||Don't make excuses, Geralt. I'm not angry. A witcher has to ply his trade, follow his Path.
   1116690|00000000||As for me, well… perhaps I expected too much of this wedding, got the wrong impression.
   1113935|00000000||Not sure I understand.
   1113023|00000000||Never mind. I should find Aldona. I am her bridesmaid, after all.
   1102555|00000000||Ah, there it is. The face of a man who's failed to understand a woman.
   1102557|00000000||You understand her?
   1102559|00000000||Of course. Women are simple. The problem is that men are hopeless fools.
   1102561|00000000||Your friend will now make a show of being hurt. Pick her some flowers or bring her a drink. She'll get over it in a snap.
   1128039|00000000||Rather manage without your advice, thank you.
   1128041|00000000||She cares for you, you have feelings for her. Don't overthink it. Surrender to spontaneous honesty - nothing more beautiful in human relationships.
   1116692|00000000||You needn't end like Aldona and Johnnus - besotted fools bound by a contract they'll never escape.
   1130072|00000000||Seize the night, seize your chance. Enjoy one another - that's it. Have fun.
   1102541|00000000||Should get back to Olgierd soon.
   1102543|00000000||And like that, it's over. Huh, here I thought I might get some more time with you. Silly, wasn't it?
   1102545|00000000||Wouldn't say that.
   1116680|00000000||True. Gotta get going.
   1116641|00000000||What did you do to him?
   1116643|00000000||Sent him back whence he came.
   1116637|00000000||What did you do to him?
   1095721|00000000||Is Vlodimir's ghost gone?
   1113927|00000000||You see? She asks after me. Misses me already!
   1102302|00000000||I'm here, my ever-loving tulip.
   1102304|00000000||That kiss as we danced made my head so light, a team of hellish stallions could not tear me away before I receive one more… or two more. Or as many as you'll give.
   1112030|00000000||You seem to have enjoyed yourself. I'm glad.
   1116631|00000000||A kiss! I knew it would end this way! An end that is but a beginning!
   1122433|00000000||No, it's just an end. It's after midnight - your time has come.
   1116633|00000000||Bah, we needn't fret such trifles. Death's not come to claw me back, so why not continue our revels?
   1102306|00000000||What's Geralt think about that? You gave your word.
   1102308|00000000||Shani, darling… I'm dead. Can't expect too much from a corpse.
   1095723|00000000||Vlodimir von Everec - go back whence you came. Please.
   1095725|00000000||Stay out of this.
   1112033|00000000||Stop! I beg you, stop!
   1095727|00000000||Get ye hence, or I'll take you with me, and your moldy crypt will look like paradise in comparison. The choice is yours.
   1116659|00000000||Aaaargh!
   1127369|00000000||Don't torture him.
   1127372|00000000||I promise he'll not die, heheh.
   1116653|00000000||Gods, what is this?
   1113020|00000000||It's past midnight. You can take off those lovely ears. Only if you want to, of course.
   1112178|00000000||Lovely as they are, think I'll put them away for now.
   1116606|00000000||A lovely custom! Blushing maids, twirling in dance, their hair swirling freely, their bodices undone, their bouncing…
   1116608|00000000||Will you stop?
   1116666|00000000||Did you see it? Shani caught the garland. She'll be next to marry as peasant superstition has it.
   1116668|00000000||Maybe. Doesn't matter. It's past midnight. Time for you to go back to the crypt.
   1116670|00000000||I can't. I'm not finished here.
   1113005|00000000||No need?! Why, there's every need!
   1105609|00000000||Ahem. Till now I'd always considered peasant jollities unworthy of a gentleman! For tell me, who among you would rub shoulders with swineherds if born a noble?
   1105611|00000000||I delighted in the beauty of buxom farm wenches, of course, and indeed still do. Given more time, I'd prove this to each and every maiden here!
   1127378|00000000||Farmhands are a different story. Never took any note of them. Had one or two groom my mounts. They did this well, but were never worthy of conversation - nay, not even if you paid me!
   1127380|00000000||For one must live by certain principles, am I right?!
   1105613|00000000||But this day… this day has changed all! Beneath the muck and dung, a peasant is a man! I understand this thanks to you!
   1127383|00000000||You've still shite all to talk about, but I don't mind anymore. For this I thank you. And say, you are well loved!
   1105615|00000000||It's almost midnight. Time for the capping!
   1105617|00000000||Wait, I'm not done!
   1105621|00000000||Oh yes you are. All the maids join in the capping!
   1105623|00000000||You're a maid too, Shani…
   1113006|00000000||I shall make a speech and that's that.
   1111916|00000000||I'll leave you for a moment. As a bridesmaid I need to be by the bride for the capping.
   1111918|00000000||Go on, Shani. I'll manage fine alone.
   1095656|00000000||Ladies and gentlemen! This night I've tasted of life's delights so fiercely, I've decided to make a speech!
   1102290|00000000||Geralt! There's no need.
   1131946|00000000||The midnight chime has struck, the capping time's a-come! What thoughts in young hearts prance, what dreams make young blood run?
   1131983|00000000||Be they nice, be they vice, of jesterly or lordly stance, out they'll come in this hour's dance!
   1131950|00000000||Let's toast the lovely couple, but afore a year shall pass, we'll toast a little bairn, who's lovelier by half.
   1131985|00000000||But ne'er you mind our singin', ‘tis only meant for laughs, a pretext and a ruse, so we can drink a glass.
   1131987|00000000||The bride has sworn her vows, but the groom still best beware, lest in the coming year, two horns on head he'll wear.
   1131989|00000000||What's got our groom a-thinkin'? He's so gloomy now. Perhaps he's second guessin', if he'll get that cow?
   1131991|00000000||You'll get your cow, my lad, and calves and milk and all, So merry make and drink, for ‘tis your wedding ball!
   1131955|00000000||Be happy, daughter dear.
   1131958|00000000||Gar-land, gar-land, gar-land!
   1131962|00000000||As hallowed tradition holds, whoever caught the garland shall be next to wed!
   1131967|00000000||That really necessary?
   1131969|00000000||It came rushing back in a torrent - how we caroused at Olgierd's wedding.
   1131971|00000000||I couldn't resist, had to pen a few words. Will you give him the letter?
   1131973|00000000||I will.
   1131975|00000000||Thanks. You're a good chap, witcher. Dull as dirt, but good.
   1131978|00000000||Heheh - witcher's talkin' to himself. Must be damn sloshed, eh?
   1131980|00000000||And good on it! Gotsta get drunk at a weddin'!
   1115850|00000000||Olgierd's wife liked flowers. Judging by the ornamentation, this might be hers.
   1115852|00000000||Seen this hairbrush. It was in bad shape in the real world.
   1116557|00000000||Not you again.
   1122672|00000000||Another dream of the past. Bet this one's incomplete, too.
   1128612|00000000||Just a little different than the painting.
   1128614|00000000||Candles also need lighting…
   1128254|00000000||These were lit in the painting… but that's not all.
   1128616|00000000||Fire was burning in the painting… Still something missing, though.
   1128618|00000000||That oughta do it.
   1115848|00000000||Castel Ravello. A Toussaint wine. Expensive.
   1115854|00000000||Silver thread, pearls… Doll must've cost a fortune.
   1115844|00000000||A lavish feast. Trying to impress the guests.
   1115535|00000000||My darling… is everything all right? You seem pale… out of sorts.
   1115538|00000000||Everything's fine, really. But why don't you tell me how you fare? I'm ever so happy to see you! Except, why didn't Grandmamma and Grandpapa come?
   1115540|00000000||It's a long, rugged journey. Muddy.
   1115544|00000000||They still refuse to meet me, is that it?
   1115563|00000000||And what's this?
   1115547|00000000||We've brought some of Iris' things. Her favorite brush, her cherished doll. Ah, and this… for you.
   1115579|00000000||Bank notes.
   1115581|00000000||We paid off your debts, bought them out. To avoid bringing shame to the family.
   1116492|00000000||So nice of Mama and Papa to remember me.
   1116501|00000000||Olgierd?
   1116503|00000000||Now you see his true nature? I warned you before the wedding.
   1134311|00000000||A ruffian and a boor who keeps the company of bandits. Are you not afraid to live under one roof with that rabble?
   1114423|00000000||Who's in the what now?
   1114421|00000000||Uh-huh?
   1114425|00000000||War, lads, is a fickle bitch. In a blink she drops one man dead in a ditch.
   1114427|00000000||The next she lets live till the sun goes down, his guts all the while strewn over the ground.
   1114429|00000000||Let the stricken roebuck weep, or give it an ale and aid it to sleep! Hahahaha!
   1114431|00000000||Bit o' grub, bit o' drink, bit o' tit - then we hit the road!
   1114415|00000000||Eh? Ants pick your stones apart!
   1114417|00000000||Easy, squire.
   1123667|00000000||Oi! Why there? What for? Life kick you in the arse, had enough?
   1124650|00000000||Terrible beast prowls the sewers down thataway. Best avoided altogether.
   1129220|00000000||Devoured dozens of maidens, folk say. And many a bold fighter's gone in and never come out.
   1104160|062fa66f||Meryn
   1015890|cafba161||Pig
   1125231|00000000||Light-haired halfling. Must be Folkert.
   1126698|00000000||Ripped open, gutted and drained. No way to determine the cause of death.
   1111772|00000000||Wanted - cradle, used but unworn… Need a beau to accompany me to a friend's wedding… Willing to trade a leaky pot for a cart…? Who writes these notices?
   1095055|00000000||Need a witcher?
   1095057|00000000||Any bloke willin' to kill a monster. A witcher would do.
   1095059|00000000||Monster? What kind?
   1095061|00000000||Big. Bad. Ugly. Squats in the sewers.
   1095063|00000000||If you're interested, drop by the Garin Estate. Ask for Olgierd von Everec. He's the one ordered this posted.
   1108420|003652cd||Time
   1127454|00000000||Aye, sugarplum?
   1127456|00000000||You're lookin' pale. Eat somethin'!
   1127458|00000000||Gonna slurp your oysters!
   1127460|00000000||Chop you up, stick you in a stew!
   1127462|00000000||You white-haired man-whore!
    432590|d184d9f7||Wraith
   1127442|00000000||Churl! Rotten churl!
   1127444|00000000||I'll gobble your liver!
   1127440|00000000||Whoreson!
   1127448|00000000||Hrm?
   1127446|00000000||Oooh, me tummy's growlin' fierce as hell….
   1115423|00000000||How do you know I'm not Geralt?
   1115451|00000000||Wait… you can see me? That is, me, Vlodimir von Everec?
   1115453|00000000||Of course, why ever wouldn't I?
   1115455|00000000||Because… I'm in Geralt's body… the witcher's… and--
   1115457|00000000||Just who would I be if the true nature of things remained hidden from me?
   1115459|00000000||Someone like you - meaning no one.
   1115461|00000000||I wouldn't want to get blood on my damsel's dress, but insult me once more and--
   1115463|00000000||You shan't touch me. I know you'd like very much to act like your brother in this situation, demonstrate how manly you are, but - let's be honest - nothing will come of it.
   1115465|00000000||You're simply not him, no matter how much you wish you were.
   1113636|00000000||But gingerbread's nowt but flour, honey, eggs and spices.
   1113638|00000000||I beg to differ, madame. You omit the most important ingredient in gingerbread - time.
   1120236|00000000||What sort of balderdash is he feeding them?
   1120238|00000000||Quiet. If you listen, you'll learn.
   1113640|00000000||Time? What do ye mean, time? An ingredient?
   1113642|00000000||Time gives the proper consistency. Time provides that ideal crunch on the outside, the delicious moistness within.
   1113644|00000000||So how much o' this time does it take?
   1113646|00000000||That you will not find in any recipe. You must surrender to your senses. Let them lead you so close to time you touch it. Let you sniff it, stroke it, even… Time, time is the key.
   1112991|00000000||Greetings, Shani. I must introduce myself. Gaunter O'Dimm.
   1115416|00000000||My, what a lovely dress. The color suits you exquisitely.
   1102668|00000000||Thanks. I've heard a lot about you, but no one mentioned cooking. Seem to know quite a bit about gingerbread.
   1102670|00000000||Quite simply, I know a lot about everything.
   1096132|00000000||Is that so? What do you know about me?
   1102672|00000000||That you were ever the worse brother. That you envied Olgierd from your earliest days and always wished to be just like him.
   1115418|00000000||I came here to revel, enjoy myself, not to discuss my brother.
   1115420|00000000||That's good. Olgierd probably wouldn't want me to talk to you about him.
   1115422|00000000||Olgierd was my brother and my friend. Never have there been more loyal comrades than us.
   1106369|00000000||I will not listen to this.
   1106368|00000000||Not true. Prove it.
   1106371|00000000||Rubbish! I never envied my brother!
   1111890|00000000||Of course you did. He was a shining role model. Olgierd ran faster, shot truer, lifted greater weights…
   1106375|00000000||Olgierd learned to read first, although you tried your damndest to beat him. As you grew up, he had his pick of girls, whereas you made do with the leftovers…
   1106377|00000000||I apologize, Shani. I'm rather sorry you have to hear this.
   1106379|00000000||Stop fooling yourself. Shani isn't here for you. She's here for Geralt. Even after death, you still play the pale imitation.
   1106381|00000000||Oh, by the way… Olgierd's a much better dancer.
   1106383|00000000||You lying dog! That's my brother! I loved him!
   1106387|00000000||The question is, were you as dear to him as he seems to have been to you?
   1106389|00000000||He made a hero of me in death! In my last battle… in truth, I was far from valiant. Five came at me. I'll not deny it, I fled…
   1113652|00000000||I hid in a cellar, yet they found me. Cornered me, like a rat. But Olgierd told everyone I flew at all five. Took them on all at once, alone!
   1113654|00000000||I'm rather curious how you know all this.
   1113656|00000000||Olgierd visits my grave. Often. Pours a drink for me, gets soused himself, and talks of the old times… he cannot see me, but I hear his every word.
   1106391|00000000||Hmm. Well, perhaps one day he'll say something veeerrry surprising…
   1113865|00000000||What're you getting at?
   1113867|00000000||I shan't disturb you any longer. Have a splendid time - for time is… time is short.
   1115471|00000000||Shani, I'm sorry, I…
   1115473|00000000||It's all right. That was… Oh, forget him. We're here to enjoy ourselves, right?
   1122409|00000000||Let's go. The night's still young.
   1118936|00000000||The capping will begin soon. Let's take our places.
   1118938|00000000||Let's. I've got an idea…
   1137617|00000000||All lies. Not a word of truth.
   1137619|00000000||Don't let it bother you.
   1137621|00000000||Olgierd was not just my brother. More importantly, he was my best mate.
   1137623|00000000||Let it go. I believe you. And now revel on. Time won't wait.
   1102176|00000000||You must know, my dear ladies, that traditional gingerbread is not your ordinary baked good.
   1102178|00000000||It's a culinary phenomenon. A legend. A dark and obscure object of the deepest desire.
   1105580|00000000||I wish to talk to you. What you said about Olgierd…
   1105072|00000000||You've not heard enough?
   1122399|00000000||Go and revel while you can. The time for talk will come later.

   1130760|00000000||*Sniff* Hm. Rotting meat?
   1134923|00000000||Shani had been a diligent student – she not only had heard of the von Everec family, but also happened to be in the possession of a tome indicating the location of their family crypt. She and Geralt decided to journey there together. Shani was to bring a censer with her, which Geralt intended to use to perform the ancient ritual of Blood Summoning to bring forth the ghost of Olgierd’s dead brother.<br>
   1134924|00000000||Thanks to the Blood Summoning (which, as is the norm during witcher adventures, did not go off without certain complications), Geralt was able to summon the ghost of Vlodimir von Everec. Vlodimir, delighted at the prospect of enjoying a “cracking good time,” stated that to do so, he would need a body… and then promptly possessed the witcher’s, despite the latter's heated resistance. From that moment till Vlodimir had had his fun, Vlod’s ghost accompanied Geralt everywhere the witcher went. And it so happened on that day, he was going to a wedding, where he was to meet Shani. Vlodimir was thrilled at this, for he had taken quite the liking to the young medic, but, learning that she meant something special to Geralt, he promised to keep his hands off her. Yet something about his manner left room to doubt he’d keep this promise…<br>

   1134929|00000000||Once Geralt and Vlodimir arrived at the wedding, the ghost jumped into Geralt’s body and threw himself headlong into a whirlwind of merriment, mirth and amusement.<br>
   1134930|00000000||Hearing Geralt recount that night's festivities, I realized it was a great shame I had not been able to attend. Not only would I have graced the guests with a performance worthy of the occasion, but also I would have witnessed its wonders first-hand, the better to now convey them to you, dear reader… Yet I consider my chance to craft an epic nuptial ballad merely delayed, not missed, for Shani caught the garland during the capping, meaning I will surely be a guest of honor at her wedding in the near future. Vlodimir, I hear, enjoyed himself tremendously, though he was forced off the stage and into the netherworld in a rather unpleasant manner by Master Mirror at the end. Before that happened, he wrote a letter to his brother in his own (that is to say, Geralt’s) blood, thus providing proof that the witcher had fulfilled Olgierd’s wish.<br>
   1135032|00000000||As the witcher had suspected, Olgierd would not simply take Geralt’s word for it that Vlodimir had not only risen from the dead (temporarily, at least), but had also had a splendid time. Yet the letter Vlod wrote in blood effectively resolved all Olgierd’s doubts. The task was deemed completed.<br>
   1134922|00000000||As Master Mirror forewarned, Olgierd von Everec asked Geralt to perform several tasks for him. One of these was to show his brother, Vlodimir, the time of his life. As I know from many pleasant personal experiences, the witcher, grim as he may sometimes seem, is more than capable of arranging a fantastic night out. Yet in this case, there was one particularly tricky catch: Vlodimir was dead. As a first step to overcoming this obstacle, Geralt decided to go see Shani, who, as a Redanian subject, an Oxenfurt resident and a woman of great learning, might just have some information about where Vlodimir is buried.<br>
   1097417|00000000||Talk to Shani about the von Everec family crypt.
   1103371|00000000||Meet Shani in front of the von Everec family crypt.

   1103373|00000000||Use your Witcher Senses to explore the von Everec family crypt.
   1103375|00000000||Light the main votive to continue the ritual.

   1103449|00000000||Meet Shani by the farm where the wedding will be held.

   1116925|00000000||Coming or not?
   1116927|00000000||I'm coming, I'm coming…
   1116930|00000000||To the wedding, then. Perhaps I'll find some more interesting diversions there.
   1116707|00000000||Are you always so easily scared?
   1106784|00000000||You're a man who's trade is literally to play with fire. How can you fear a tiny runt of a dog?
   1116709|00000000||Was a monster! A daemon!
   1116711|00000000||So you said. You're a stoneless coward, sir - that's that.
   1106786|00000000||Oh! Beg your pardon… I'm not a coward - I'm cautious. Know what'd become of a fire eater who paid no 'eed to caution?
   1107279|00000000||Hmm… I suppose he might singe his tongue.
   1116713|00000000||Guessed it. Settles that misunderstanding.
   1116695|00000000||Missing man, missing mutt.
   1094599|00000000||Am I seeing this right? That gammy puss ran up a tree to escape that puppy?
   1094601|00000000||Guess so. You! Get down!
   1094603|00000000||Oh, no. No bloody chance! I value my life!
   1094605|00000000||What do we do?
   1094861|00000000||Sit.
   1094613|00000000||Now that is power! If I'd had that, the whoresons never would've gutted me.
   1116698|00000000||Make it do some folly. Roll about on the ground, that sort of sport!
   1110777|00000000||No.
   1116700|00000000||Ugh, could you be any more of a bore? I'll do it myself.
   1110779|00000000||Roll over!
   1101876|00000000||Leave it alone.
   1094615|00000000||Were I to command it to eat its own tail, it would do so, right?
   1101878|00000000||Daemon! Doghouse, now!
   1101881|00000000||Now what've you done? Why ever? Ruined my fun.
   1110782|00000000||Have it at the wedding.
   1094607|00000000||I'll calm it.
   1094606|00000000||We chase the dog off.
   1094609|00000000||Don't know how to handle yappy little dogs?
   1094611|00000000||I'd chase it off with a stick. But that strikes me as… unwitcherly.
   1101871|00000000||Effective, though.
   1094859|00000000||Job done.
   1094619|00000000||Climb down. Man-eating beast's gone, as you can see.
   1101883|00000000||You sure it won't return?
   1113698|00000000||Positive.
   1113700|00000000||Better safe than sorry, I always say…
   1101885|00000000||Geralt, this jester is drunk as a skunk. I hope he's not polished off that bottle yet.
   1113703|00000000||I saved your life, man. Do you not at least owe me a sip?
   1113705|00000000||Course. Bottoms up.
   1113708|00000000||I say, cracking good mead. Now I understand why you wanted some private time with it.
   1113710|00000000||Fine mead, true… But I was fleeing an 'ound? 'Ound? Bah, it was a monster, a furry, fangy devil! They chose a fittin' name for it…
   1124670|00000000||Those're... excellent ears. Might try a pair like that. Just not sure they'd fit under my cap.
   1116704|00000000||Your hat. Here.
   1094849|00000000||Your cap, sir. Lost it running from that pup like a gutless coward.
   1094851|00000000||Ohh… my dearest cap. Always brought me good luck, it has… I wear it for every performance.
   1116703|00000000||You can't possibly go to the wedding like that.
   1113780|00000000||You can forget about performing in your state.
   1113782|00000000||And just what state would that be?
   1113784|00000000||Look at yourself, man. You're a tramp, can barely stand, let alone perform.
   1113786|00000000||First off - that's bollocks. Second, I'm a fire eater, not a stilt walker. Standin' straight ain't a requirement…
   1121984|00000000||Oh, you shan't pull the wool over my eyes. I know your type.
   1121986|00000000||Now, here's the plan - we shall head down this path till we arrive at the wedding. You'll have sobered by then.
   1121988|00000000||But--
   1121992|00000000||Silence! Do you know me, sir? When a nobleman speaks, you listen!
   1121995|00000000||You will stay close at my side. We will return to the wedding, where you will put on a show to make our honored guests soil their breeches from joy. Got it?
   1121997|00000000||Y-yes.
   1121999|00000000||Good. Then let's be off.
   1121973|00000000||Let's go. You can sober up on the way.
   1121974|00000000||Fire eating - what's the trick?
   1110068|00000000||This may be my only chance to ask - your fire guzzling trickery, how does it work?
   1110838|00000000||Ooh, they'd toss me out the guild if I told. 'Cept if I took you on as an apprentice. In 'alf a year's time, you'd learn.
   1110840|00000000||I haven't half a year. Come, just between you and me. We've drunk together - we're practically brothers!
   1116874|00000000||Drank it all yourself. You're no brother of mine.
   1116876|00000000||You dare toy with me this way?! Very well! Refuse to tell me, and I shall leave you here as a morsel for any passing boars, bears or bloodthirsty fawns. So choose wisely.
   1110070|00000000||This here's assault! He's suppressin' the arts!
   1116880|00000000||Out with it!
   1110072|00000000||I g-- I got this special mixture I drink before every show. After that, I can eat fire, spit fire, do what I please, and it don't burn nothing.
   1110074|00000000||Is that all? Where's the art in it? Any dribbling imbecile can smear his throat with a protective slurry.
   1110076|00000000||I've had just about enough of this! First they release the hounds, then come and steal my mead, and now insults! I'm done 'ere! Goodbye!
   1110843|00000000||Didn't mean to offend the bloody charlatan. Do something.
   1112974|00000000||Now, you're gonna forget everything you've seen, said and heard in the woods.
   1110861|00000000||Wouldn't a smack upside the head help the matter? Put the cheating coward back in his place?
   1110863|00000000||No need.
   1110089|00000000||You'll go back to the wedding and show everybody your tricks.
   1110865|00000000||Ugh, your charlatan's tricks.
   1110867|00000000||Yes, sir. I'll do as you say.
   1110078|00000000||Not going anywhere.
   1110091|00000000||Do what you want. Not about to beg you to stay.
   1110871|00000000||But the scamp's already been paid!
   1110873|00000000||Not my problem.
   1110875|00000000||Uh-huh. Then know this - I leave now. I've never seen such behavior. This is overt lack of respect for the arts.
   1110093|00000000||You two-bit honorless pricklicker!
   1116923|00000000||No sense raging about it. Back to the wedding, let's go.
   1110079|00000000||Do what you want.
   1110077|00000000||Listen, I'll pay you.
   1110081|00000000||Listen, I'll give you some more coin, and you'll go back to the wedding.
   1110853|00000000||Are you daft?! This extortionist's already got his due!
   1110855|00000000||Take it or leave it.
   1110083|00000000||Right. Convincin'.
   1110857|00000000||Honorless prick. Olgierd had it right - all artists are whores.
   1110085|00000000||Let's go.
   1110394|00000000||Ehh, I told him to hide. Bully good hider with a pup at his heels, why not now?
   1110396|00000000||No magic delights, I suppose. Best tell the bride's mother.
   1110040|00000000||Tell me, are bears often boar-shaped, in your experience?
   1110042|00000000||Got weak eyes, see… Besides, I'm a fire eater, not some damned naturalist.
   1110044|00000000||Indeed you are not, master, uh… hmm, believe I failed to ask - what do they call you?
   1110046|00000000||David Artensborrow.
   1118673|00000000||Listen here, master Hattensburrow. Stay close and no harm will come to you.
   1118675|00000000||I'll see to it your drunken, fire-spitting gob gets to the wedding safe and sound.
   1094865|00000000||Ahh, my first witcher contract. Done.
   1094867|00000000||Fire eater - found, his arse - saved…
   1112972|00000000||If I could live again, I'd be a witcher. For damned certain.
   1094582|00000000||I require a rescue! Get me outta here! Before it tears me to shreds!
   1094580|00000000||Help! Somebody 'elp me! Save me! Anybody!
   1113778|00000000||Gads! Bear!
   1110028|00000000||Bear?! That?! As much as your cock's a tent-pole. Hide, you blind fool!
   1110030|00000000||Save me!
   1107598|00000000||Keep calm, stay close.
   1107600|00000000||Shan't stray a step. Wild animals behind every stump in these woods.
   1094107|00000000||Save me! Sod off, beast! Somebody drag this drool bucket away!
   1094572|00000000||Is there anyone in this forsaken hole?! Anyone at all??
   1110056|00000000||Almost there. Even a buffoon like you should make it at this point.
   1110940|00000000||Seems there shall be no tricks. We must inform the bride's mother the magician turned coward.
   1115660|00000000||My first witcher contract.
   1115662|00000000||Didn't turn out as I'd hoped. Yet I still had a cracking time.
   1137625|00000000||Daemon's not half as black as they paint him.
   1127842|00000000||Save me, witcher!
   1049787|6c3c7e75||Wyvern
   1098658|00000000||Well, well. Got an early bird in our midst.
   1098661|00000000||Let's begin.
   1124052|00000000||Prime. Just one patrol. Mixture of yours must've worked.
   1098665|00000000||Eveline. You ready?
   1098667|00000000||Are you kidding? Of course I am.
   1099538|00000000||Three… two… one.
   1098727|00000000||Bugger it all! Ye said there'd be no one inside!
   1114301|00000000||It's clear. On your way!
   1114304|00000000||Ploughin' city fowl. Shite all over, again.
   1114310|00000000||Groo, grooo, groo!
   1114312|00000000||What?! I'll show you...
   1114307|00000000||Patrol's turnin' round!
   1114315|00000000||We've one minute! Move!
   1114317|00000000||Damn. Should've blown myself to bits, prick and all.
   1114258|00000000||It's clear. On your way!
   1114261|00000000||Ploughin' city fowl. Shite all over, again.
   1114267|00000000||Groo, grooo, groo!
   1114269|00000000||What?! I'll show you--
   1114264|00000000||Patrol's turnin' round!
   1114272|00000000||We've one minute! Move!
   1114274|00000000||Hail Melitele, hallowed mother, keep us from…
   1098695|00000000||If memory serves, you assured us there'd be no one inside.
   1098729|00000000||Agreed. Past the point of no return.
   1098733|00000000||Gotta agree. Backing out's not an option anymore. Need to see this through, whatever happens.
   1124035|00000000||Hallowed words.
   1098697|00000000||Whatever… Don your masks and let's go.
   1098699|00000000||{…}
   1124037|00000000||One guard could mean many more. You'd best draw your sword now.
   1124039|00000000||No.
   1124041|00000000||What now?
   1124044|00000000||No one dies. Said so from the start.
   1098731|00000000||Not the time, true. But we'll discuss this later. You can be sure of that.
   1099541|00000000||At your service, mate.
   1098728|00000000||We'll argue later. You can be sure of that.
   1099543|00000000||Seems my informer was wrong.
   1099545|00000000||Is that all you've got to say? I nearly broke my neck!
   1099547|00000000||You knew what you were signin' up for. This is no time to argue.
   1098735|00000000||Careful, now. One guard could mean many more.
   1099555|00000000||Geralt, you lead. On your tiptoes, hand on your sword.
   1099557|00000000||Don't fret, love. Ye're fetchin' no matter what ye wear!
   1099559|00000000||Would you like a ball gown and tiara to go with that?
   1099562|00000000||Shut it. And you, Eveline, no more foolishness. Come on.
   1114433|00000000||Stranger! Greetings! Might you be interested in a moment's chat?
   1128825|00000000||I have for you an offer, white-haired man.
   1135739|00000000||Who would have expected Geralt to come across a camp of Ofieris somewhere on the Redanian frontier? Yet life can be surprising – travelers from a land far across the sea had indeed chosen to pitch their tents in just such a place. The new arrivals had come to gain knowledge and give gifts, but, since life can be unpleasantly surprising as well, they were attacked and robbed by locals. When Geralt heard about this, he felt sorry for the foreigners' loss and decided to help them retrieve their belongings. Malicious types might claim he only did so to get the crafting diagrams he'd been promised as a reward, but I am not among their number and do not believe that for one instant.<br>
   1135740|00000000||After a great deal of searching, the witcher found the stolen diagrams and delivered them to the merchant as agreed. The merchant repaid him with gratitude and copies of the diagrams translated into a tongue local craftsmen could understand.
   1135741|00000000||While wandering the Redanian borderlands Geralt happened across some crafting diagrams written in a foreign tongue. He supposed the language was Ofieri, but, not being a linguist, he could not be certain. Wanting to resolve this mystery, he decided to look around for Ofieris, having made the indisputable deduction that where there are Ofieri documents, there must surely be Ofieris as well.<br>
   1135744|00000000||Look for the place where the Ofieri merchant was attacked.
   1135745|00000000||Use your Witcher Senses to search the site of the attack.
   1135746|00000000||Use your Witcher Senses to follow the bandits' trail.
   1135747|00000000||Search the bandits' hideout.
   1136720|00000000||Find all the diagrams from the Ofieri gear set and return them to the merchant to be duplicated and translated.
   1135749|00000000||Read the letter you found.
   1135750|00000000||Search the remaining bandit camps.
   1135885|00000000||Return the diagrams to the Ofieri merchant.
   1135886|00000000||Wait one day for the merchant to translate the diagrams.
   1135887|00000000||Collect the translated diagrams from the Ofieri merchant.
   1135914|00000000||Find someone who can speak Ofieri.

   1135063|00000000||Northeast of Novigrad Geralt stumbled across a small camp of Ofieri travelers. Geralt struck up a conversation with one of their number and the topic of discussion turned to horses. Before he knew it, he'd agreed to a race to test whose mare was the swiftest. Had he been to eager in his boasting? Could Roach really go neck and neck with a fabled Ofieri steed? Time would soon tell!<br>
   1135064|00000000||Roach emerged the victor, and Geralt was able to bask in her glory. The Ofieri merchant took his loss with tremendous grace and awarded the winning horse and rider an excellent saddle.<br>

   1100647|00000000||Don't provoke me. Never know, might choose to take your head.
   1100673|00000000||You're wounded, tired. Figure my chances are good.
   1104772|00000000||At your service, mate.
   1100683|00000000||Casimir, stand with me. I'll make you my treasurer, your salary in the thousands, mate.
   1100686|00000000||Sorry, Geralt. But coin's coin, no two ways about it.
   1100678|00000000||As I said, at your service, mate.
   1099052|00000000||Hmm, dumb. But have it your way. Let's make this quick, before the soldiers get down here.
   1099042|00000000||Dumb decision. But have it your way.
   1100701|00000000||Give me the damn casket, and let's get out of here.
   1100704|00000000||As you wish. This way.
   1100698|00000000||Oooph. That's a load off my prick!
   1099055|00000000||I could drop you easily. But maybe I don't have to. We could try to figure this out.
   1099057|00000000||A compromise looks unlikely. We both want Max's House.
   1100680|00000000||Not quite. You just need the contents. Me - the box.
   1100690|00000000||They're downstairs!
   1100692|00000000||So be it. Seal it with a handshake.
   1099043|00000000||This is not a bust. We can figure this out.
   1137264|00000000||You tricked me.
   1137266|00000000||And you were prepared to let me face Horst's thugs alone. To my mind, we're even.
   1137271|00000000||Now Max Borsodi's House - if you've absolutely got to have it, you'll need to take it from me by force.
   1100670|00000000||Gents. Gents - keep calm!
   1099039|00000000||Satisfied?
   1099041|00000000||Exceptionally! You?
   1100642|00000000||No. And I won't be until I find Max Borsodi's House. In this vault - or so you said.
   1100645|00000000||And it is. There. But, I fear it's not yours for the takin'.
   1100651|00000000||You see, it houses my father's will. A scroll thanks to which Ewald Borsodi, long missing, will assume the family fortune.
   1101309|00000000||And Geralt of Rivia, who you cheated, what'll he assume?
   1101311|00000000||Alas. But he's free to choose anything else.
   1099260|00000000||All right. I'm willin' to take that.
   1099290|00000000||A consensus was in sight from the start!
   1099292|00000000||Slow down. Witcher hasn't paid yet.
   1099248|00000000||Don't know about that, Geralt. Takes good will to negotiate. Afraid I've none of that for you.
   1099250|00000000||You got to be mad!
   1099252|00000000||Quite the reasonable offer, to my mind.
   1099254|00000000||Your mouth!
   1099256|00000000||Hm… don't know, don't know…
   1099258|00000000||Whoa-hoh! An agreement's in sight!
   1099294|00000000||No. I've no patience for your kind. Full price, and not a copper less!
   1099296|00000000||Overdid it a bit, witcher. Even I'm willin' to admit that.
   1099298|00000000||Aye! See? And you keep your mouth shut!
   1098389|00000000||Hah! Beat your arse good! Heheheh!
   1099328|00000000||Mhh, you should've passed, mate, should've passed.
   1099330|00000000||The price of Quinto's freedom just went up! Twofold!
   1113915|00000000||Hah! No man can match me! Not a fuckin' one! Come on now, witcher - say it!
   1114077|00000000||Ahem. No better fighter than Hans of Cidaris.
   1114079|00000000||Exactly! Couldn't 'ave said it better meself! Now, Quinto - you can still buy the shit's freedom, but the price just went up. Twofold!
   1098339|00000000||Fine. I'll pay.
   1098391|00000000||Pass for me too. Let's total it up. I win.
   1098393|00000000||Heavy-handed, Hans. The Tretogor maneuver - with cards like that?!
   1098395|00000000||Ugh! Get him out of here, before I fuckin' burst a--
   1113909|00000000||Thought you looked wimpy. Didn't expect it to be that easy, though.
   1113911|00000000||Must admit I'm fairly surprised meself.
   1113913|00000000||Your trap! Both of youse! Take him, witcher. And bugger you bo--
   1114749|00000000||All right, let's go. Stone's throw away.
   1114744|00000000||Fine. Let's go.
   1098367|00000000||Need you to open something for me. Something bigger than a cage.
   1098369|00000000||Sounds interestin'. Dyin' to hear the details.
   1099325|00000000||Herbalist's hut near Oxenfurt. Knock on the door, ask for yarrow extract.
   1114751|00000000||Not headed there just yet. Got something to tend to first. Meet you later. Head out of the city, ask for directions. Folk'll know the way.
   1114753|00000000||Sound advice. See you.
   1114745|00000000||Not head there just yet.
   1115377|00000000||Need you to open something. Something bigger than a cage.
   1115379|00000000||Sounds interestin'. Dyin' to hear the details.
   1115383|00000000||Herbalist's hut near Oxenfurt. Knock on the door, ask for yarrow extract.
   1114743|00000000||Hm. Not sure I know where that is. Might you be goin' there? We could go together.
   1098364|00000000||Got a job for you.
   1098371|00000000||Tell you later. Got… got someone else I need to talk to.
   1098373|00000000||I get that. When the time's ripe, look for me at the Academy gate. Come nightfall. Farewell.
   1098365|00000000||Nothing just yet.
   1098359|00000000||…
   1098361|00000000||Wha--? But, how did y--?
   1098363|00000000||Fishbone. Did it yesterday. I was waitin' for a lull, to slip out. Witcher showed up afore I could.
   1099323|00000000||Let that be my recommendation. Now, do tell, what's it you need me for?
   1098349|00000000||Call it my loss. Here.
   1098351|00000000||Ah, nothin' quite like the weight of a purse full o' gold. Right, Quinto - you're dumb as shite, but lucky as--
   1098344|00000000||My loss. I'll pay.
   1098343|00000000||I'll be back.
   1098347|00000000||Hm. I'll be back.
   1098345|00000000||Pay you later.
   1098422|00000000||So what'll it be? We got a deal or not?
   1098420|00000000||Well, willin' to pay? 'Cause I'm torn, don't know if I should send him to the gallows or wait.
   1098397|00000000||What now? Don't you understand Common? Stay away from the cage!
   1098240|00000000||You Quinto?
   1098267|00000000||The one and only. A pleasure, but who might you be?
   1098242|00000000||Whoa, ho! I'll have no pleasure here! Witcher, keep clear of the cage, right?
   1098244|00000000||First you use threats to extort coin, and now you want to scheme with my prisoner? Not a chance!
   1098253|00000000||What'd he do?
   1098292|00000000||What'd he do to step on your toes?
   1098294|00000000||Ours? Not ours. But he's stuck sticks up a number of bankers' arses. Put a tidy price on his head, they did.
   1099179|00000000||And as Master Hans of Cidaris is an enterprisin' individual, he decided to nab me and claim the reward.
   1099181|00000000||Anyone give you leave to talk?! Shut your trap!
   1098252|00000000||Quinto - can't do without him.
   1098314|00000000||I need Quinto. Alive.
   1099193|00000000||And I need coin. Lots of it.
   1099195|00000000||Lucky thing I don't much care who pays me - you, or the bankers.
   1099267|00000000||Meanin' Master Hans of Cidaris' moral spine is rather bendy.
   1099269|00000000||You'll be the one with the bendy spine in a minute! I said, shut your mouth!
   1099263|00000000||Just as I said, an enterprisin' individual.
   1099265|00000000||And just as I said, clamp it shut! Stop interruptin'!
   1098325|00000000||Where was I? Right. Want me to let him go? Pay up. But I've a special rate for you. You fleeced me, now it's my turn.
   1098323|00000000||Where was I? Right. Want me to let him go? Pay up. Same as the wanted posters say.
   1098342|00000000||How about a game of gwent?
   1098375|00000000||Buy him out? Pretty pedestrian. How about we play a round of cards for Quinto's freedom?
   1098377|00000000||Hmm. Why not. But lose, and the price on his head'll double. You in?
   1098385|00000000||What the hell. I'm game.
   1098387|00000000||Got my fingers crossed!
   1098378|00000000||Yeah, I'll play.
   1098379|00000000||Too risky.
   1098381|00000000||No. Way too risky.
   1098383|00000000||So pay up or piss off. No three ways about it.
   1112415|00000000||You're acting like an old fishwife.
   1112418|00000000||Mh, famous mercenary, supposedly, but you're acting like an old fishwife. Just counting the crowns, counting the crowns.
   1114027|00000000||What? I'll not take any insults from some bloody mutant! I proved my mettle at Hagge, Dillingen, Brenna and--
   1114029|00000000||All long ago and probably only half true. You're bold, sure… with your mouth.
   1114031|00000000||Ooo… That must've hurt, that.
   1112434|00000000||Cheat me out o' coin, then dare insult me?! Take it back, you bastard! Open your gob and take it right back!
   1112432|00000000||What?! Those words! Bark 'em back, you bastard!
   1113805|00000000||Bare fists. Make me take it back. If you fail, you'll let Quinto go. Deal?
   1113807|00000000||Bloody deal! Lads, give us some space. I need to show this drifter what happens when you cross Hans of Cidaris!
   1113739|00000000||Got a better idea. Fight me - for Quinto.
   1113741|00000000||So be it. I take it back.
   1113860|00000000||Calm down, now. Helmet's liable to fall off. I take it back. Satisfied?
   1113862|00000000||I advise you well! Do not rile me again! Now pay up or sod off!
   1098341|00000000||Let's make a deal.
   1099271|00000000||Hans, to claim that reward, you've gotta deliver Quinto to the right hands. Seems a… complication.
   1099273|00000000||Time's a consideration. And we all know time is coin.
   1099275|00000000||Shut it! What's your point, witcher?
   1099277|00000000||Bankers are far away. Whereas I'm here, saving you a lot of trouble. Think you should drop the price.
   1099246|00000000||Hrmph. By how much?
   1115356|00000000||Yes? What was that?
   1115358|00000000||Gods, grant them happiness. My son at the least…
   1115354|00000000||Goodness!
   1138359|00000000||Mother
   1107857|00000000||Calm it down.
   1107868|00000000||Problem, gramps?
   1107851|00000000||Come get me! C'mon!
   1107874|00000000||Smash the arsemunch!
   1107853|00000000||No touchin'. Nothin'.
   1107855|00000000||Get goin'.
   1107870|00000000||Hexin'! Devilry!
   1107872|00000000||Oh, you mother fu--
   1133953|396405b3||Circus Hand
   1098803|00000000||Time you took a gander downstairs. Vault's open.
   1114385|00000000||Haaa-ya!
   1114388|00000000||Stop him! He's not to flee!
   1114391|00000000||Locked themselves in!
   1114393|00000000||Bollocks!
   1114396|00000000||Dammit.
   1114399|00000000||Lay down your arms! You have no chance!
   1098771|00000000||Perhaps not.
   1099603|00000000||But we do have hostages.
   1099606|00000000||Mercy, master!
   1099608|00000000||On the count of three, we go in! One! Two!
   1099611|00000000||Aaaarrrrrgh!
   1099613|00000000||Come one step closer and folk will die!
   1099616|00000000||Hold, now! We must negotiate!
   1099619|00000000||What're your demands? To release the hostages!
   1099622|00000000||Buy us a bit o' time, Geralt.
   1099650|00000000||Drink to our health, once you're far away.
   1100322|00000000||Get to work, Quinto. We'll try and hold off the assault.
   1100325|00000000||Get to work, Casimir. We'll try and hold off the assault.
   1099653|00000000||You had your chance! Attaaack!
   1099655|00000000||Still insist on usin' that wooden sword?
   1099648|00000000||I'd gladly go with ye, miss. But I'm afeared I'm a wee bit too bulky. 'Twas a pleasure.
   1099625|00000000||Not about to hide behind these folk. I'm letting them go.
   1099627|00000000||Are you mad? Any idea what'll happen?
   1099641|00000000||Yes. And you have any idea what'll happen if you try to stop me? Out of my way. Now!
   1099644|00000000||An honorable deed. The court's sure to consider it a mitigatin' factor. Now, you've one minute to come out. One at a time. Hands on your heads!
   1099646|00000000||I'm going. Up the chimney and out. It's grown too hot, pure and simple. Best of luck, gentlemen.
   1099623|00000000||Not about to use innocents as living shields.
   1099662|00000000||Pull back from the auction house.
   1099704|00000000||We have one demand. Pull back from the auction house.
   1098782|00000000||…
   1098773|00000000||…
   1099706|00000000||You know I cannot do that!
   1099708|00000000||You can! Just not sure you want to. How about I help you decide, kill a hostage?
   1099711|00000000||Just do what they want! I beg you! Aaaargh!
   1099713|00000000||Calm yourself! No one is to be harmed, clear?
   1099715|00000000||Nothing simpler! So long as you take your boys and pull out. We'll all live happily ever after.
   1099718|00000000||I repeat - that is not an option! We must bargain, reach an agreement!
   1100178|00000000||Doesn't matter. Long as it rolls.
   1107129|00000000||We're not picky. Any old cart. Long as it has wheels that roll.
   1107131|00000000||All right. I'll get it done! In exchange, you must release the hostages!
   1107133|00000000||How many?!
   1107135|00000000||All of them!
   1107142|00000000||Take me for a fool? No chance.
   1107144|00000000||You've got to understand. Safety of the hostages is my primary concern.
   1107146|00000000||No, you have to understand! One's got a knife to his neck! A sharp knife!
   1107149|00000000||I was willin' to meet you half way! Instead, I hear threats!
   1107151|00000000||Bloodshed - is that what you want? Have it your way. Attaaaack!
   1107136|00000000||Take me for a fool? No chance.
   1100069|00000000||Give you another chance, Reginald! You got ten minutes to think of a better joke! Don't fuck this up!
   1098798|00000000||Actually kind of funny.
   1100060|00000000||Heh. Actually kind of funny! Make that up yourself?!
   1100062|00000000||No, I--!
   1100065|00000000||Aaargh! For the love of the gods, stop saying "NO!"
   1100067|00000000||Yes! Yes! I made it up meself! All alone!
   1100071|00000000||Got talent, Reginald! Start thinking of your next joke! You got ten minutes.
   1100208|00000000||Good will gesture, now! Letting one hostage go! Then another hostage for every joke you tell me! Deal?!
   1100210|00000000||Deal! Ten minutes!
   1100222|00000000||Ugh. Good work.
   1100078|00000000||Sorry, boys. You'll have to go on without me. I didn't sign on for this turn of events.
   1100080|00000000||Just one way out of here. Through the vault.
   1100130|00000000||There's a second - the chimney. Believe I'll squeeze through.
   1100133|00000000||Doubt you can, witcher. You've no choice, I'm afraid. Let's go. Downstairs.
   1107166|00000000||You know I can't do that! Here's a compromise - one hostage now, the rest once the wagon arrives!
   1107169|00000000||So be it! Agreed!
   1107171|00000000||Thanks be to Melitele!
   1107173|00000000||But anything smells fishy, or you dawdle even a bit, heads will roll, understand?!
   1107175|00000000||Calm, now! You'll hear horses neighin' before a quarter hour's out! Matko! Chedrew! City stables! On the double!
   1107137|00000000||I'll set one free now. The rest later.
   1107154|00000000||Prepared to let us walk away peacefully?!
   1107156|00000000||Officer's word!
   1107158|00000000||All right! So be it! Let them go.
   1107160|00000000||A right shite idea.
   1107162|00000000||I know what I'm doing. Open the damn door.
   1107165|00000000||An honorable deed! And a stupid one. Attaaaack!
   1107138|00000000||Fine. So be it.
   1099754|00000000||See if I can't make this clear! We're not at a food market! No bargains to be made here! Lives are at stake!
   1099756|00000000||I understand, I do, but--!
   1099758|00000000||No "buts!" Gonna count to three! Then heads will roll! One!
   1099760|00000000||Gods have mercy! Just do what he asks!
   1099762|00000000||Y-you leave me no choice!
   1099764|00000000||Two!
   1099766|00000000||Attaaaack!
   1099719|00000000||Told you to pull back.
   1100149|00000000||So we want a wagon. And horses.
   1100135|00000000||It's the middle of the night! Where am I to find a wagon?!
   1100137|00000000||Rather go looking for caskets?
   1100140|00000000||Aaaargh! He means it!
   1100142|00000000||Good point! A wagon, then! What kind?!
   1100143|00000000||Bring us a wagon and horses.
   1099720|00000000||Tell me a joke.
   1099772|00000000||So tell me a joke! Any joke! So long as it's funny!
   1099774|00000000||Excuse me?! This is no--!
   1099776|00000000||Got a tip for you! No charge! Every tip after this will cost you - in the blood of an innocent!
   1099778|00000000||When talking to someone who's holding hostages, never use the words "no," "not," "but," or "maybe!" Understand, Reginald?!
   1099780|00000000||My name's not Reg--!
   1099783|00000000||Aaaaargh! You-- You're not supposed to say "not!"
   1099785|00000000||Huh, see that?! This one gets the idea! And if I want to call you Reginald, I'll call you Reginald! Clear?!
   1099787|00000000||Y-yes! Clear!
   1099789|00000000||Excellent! So lemme hear the joke, Reginald! And believe me - you better hope it makes me laugh!
   1099792|00000000||A l-little elflin' runs up to its m-mother callin', "Poop! Poop!" Sh-she says, "It's o-over there, love, c-cut yourself a slice!"
   1099794|00000000||Pathetic, Reginald! A joke that bad's a damn crime, you know?! And crimes demand punishment!
   1099796|00000000||No, no! Wait!
   1100056|00000000||Aaaargh! You swiving idiot! You're not to say "NO!"
   1100058|00000000||Damn it all. Enough! Attaaack!
   1098797|00000000||Pathetic.
   1099790|00000000||You a racist, Reginald?
   1099798|00000000||You a racist, Reginald?!
   1099800|00000000||No! Not at all. I just--!
   1099803|00000000||Aaaaargh! Don't say "NO!"
   1099805|00000000||Yes! Yes! I'm a racist! I bloody hate elves! Dwarves too!
   1100177|00000000||Carriage that carried Radovid to his coronation. Nothing less.
   1100225|00000000||Radovid's coronation carriage! Nothing less! Drawn by two snow-white mares!
   1100227|00000000||Do you think this situation a jest?!
   1100229|00000000||Do you?!
   1100232|00000000||Aaaargh! No! You're both right! This is no jest!
   1100234|00000000||I want us to reach an agreement! I don't want anyone to get hurt! But you must not ask the impossible!
   1100236|00000000||Second time you're turning me down. Shit negotiation tactic.
   1100246|00000000||It seems negotiation's not my strong suit! Nor is it yours! Attaaack!
   1100249|00000000||Oops. Tipped the scales.
   1100308|00000000||Bravo. Splendid job you did there.
   1100310|00000000||I'm a witcher. Not your negotiator.
   1100312|00000000||Dammit. Explosion triggered that fight. Could've done without both.
   1100314|00000000||That explosion gets us in the vault.
   1100320|00000000||So? Satisfied? Conscience still clear?
   1100331|00000000||Follow my own rules. Couldn't give shit if you approve.
   1100333|00000000||Right. Our paths will diverge soon enough.
   1100335|00000000||In the meantime, the vault awaits. Ought to be open by now.
   1100316|00000000||Where's Eveline?
   1100318|00000000||She's fled. All the better. Fewer hands reachin' out for loot. Come on, before reinforcements arrive.
   1126114|00000000||No fear they'll send more soldiers in?
   1126116|00000000||If your concoction's worth anythin', most're standin' in line to the latrines. Buys us a bit of time, that.
   1135676|c2545658||Walthemor Mitty
   1050729|c964417a||Alghoul
   1106710|00000000||Clear for now. Knock on wood.
   1106712|00000000||Good. Eyes in the back of your heads, everyone.
   1106714|00000000||Mine are open. I've already seen several things I'd gladly take with me.
   1106716|00000000||Not now. The vault - that's our target. Is that clear?
   1096218|00000000||Not a problem. I'll go right away.
   1096220|00000000||I shall be much obliged!
   1096222|00000000||See you in a minute, Vimme.
   1096202|00000000||Sure. I'll look for your earring.
   1094254|00000000||Time to go, Vimme.
   1094272|00000000||Countess, forgive us. Time we were on our way.
   1094274|00000000||So soon? A great shame. Whatever the reason, I wish you luck on the Path.
   1094276|00000000||Where you headed in such a rush?
   1096183|00000000||To the door. Sooner we finish up here, the better.
   1096205|00000000||Forgive me, Countess. But if there's no monster on the balcony, it's just not something I should bother with.
   1096207|00000000||A pity. But I understand. The Witchers' Code.
   1096210|00000000||Really. You're swine, ye know? Finding an earring - what's that to you?
   1096212|00000000||Ah, Vimme... The countess didn't lose an earring. Her ears aren't even pierced.
   1096214|00000000||That's right! So what's she on ab--?
   1096216|00000000||Don't know, don't want to know. Don't need to get involved in yet other scheme.
   1096203|00000000||Not something I want to bother with.
   1094256|00000000||Does the Countess have her eye on anything particular today?
   1094258|00000000||No. But Horst Borsodi insisted he would put up something that would be of interest.
   1094260|00000000||Did he happen to say what it was?
   1094262|00000000||No. Oh, you know what he's like - a walking enigma.
   1094264|00000000||On another topic… Master Geralt, I was wondering if you'd be willing to help a lady in need?
   1096199|00000000||Depends on the nature of the need.
   1096201|00000000||Oh, it's quite the trifle. I stepped out onto the balcony a moment ago. I dropped an earring while there. I couldn't find it - it must have fallen through the floor boards. Perhaps you, with your cat eyes…?
   1094252|00000000||Got your eye on anything in particular today, Countess?
   1094253|00000000||Where'd you develop this interest in witchers' things?
   1094266|00000000||Mind if I ask how the Countess became interested in us humble monster slayers?
   1094268|00000000||I've some pleasant associations. Dating from my oh so distant youth.
   1094270|00000000||Dinnae ye say such things, Countess! Ye look right fetchin' to me!
   1096178|00000000||That's very kind, Master Vivaldi, but apart from my vedyminaica I also own a number of mirrors.
   1096180|00000000||Your most prized piece - what would it be?
   1096184|00000000||An armor element, an antique. School of the Wolf. From 1234.
   1096186|00000000||Classic! Is it up for sale?
   1096188|00000000||I fear not. It's a memento, one of great sentimental value.
   1100559|00000000||But perhaps the Countess's got other witcher curios she's willin' to part with? Or acquire. Perhaps ye could trade? I'd charge… five percent - a modest, uh, transaction fee.
   1100565|00000000||Vimme, afraid you'll have to finagle your coin out of someone else today.
   1100561|00000000||Thanks, but no thanks.
   1100560|00000000||Sure. Why not.
   1100563|00000000||Vimme, never seen anyone so good at laying their mitts on coin that clinked within earshot. But what the hell… see if we can't make a deal.
   1094241|00000000||Greetings to the honorable Countess! Madame, allow me to introduce my dear friend, Geralt of Rivia.
   1094243|00000000||…witcher of the School of the Wolf.
   1094249|00000000||Forgive me, but have we had the pleasure…?
   1094251|00000000||No. But your guild is unmistakable. Your medallion…
   1096166|00000000||Take note, Geralt. Countess Mignole is an eminent collector of vedyminaica.
   1096168|00000000||Vedymi- what now?
   1096170|00000000||All manner of objects related to the witcherly profession. Swords, gear, medallions.
   1094298|00000000||I'd like to be alone, if you don't mind.
   1094302|00000000||You remind me of one I used to know…
   1094300|00000000||You've my utmost respect, master.
   1096250|00000000||I don't have any good news.
   1096305|00000000||Huh, afraid I have bad news…
   1096307|00000000||Oh!
   1096309|00000000||Please, tell me… did he at least die like a witcher?
   1096311|00000000||No. He died like a hero.
   1137200|00000000||Hhh, there is that…
   1096313|00000000||I thank you for tolerating a decrepit madwoman so elegantly.
   1096315|00000000||Please don't say that.
   1096317|00000000||I am old and I am wealthy. I may say what I please. And now, be so kind and leave me to my thoughts.
   1096294|00000000||Vesemir's fine, the picture of health. And he still wears a mustache.
   1096296|00000000||I'm relieved to hear it. And, hm, did he ever find a… a mate?
   1096298|00000000||No. Haven't seen him with a woman in five decades. Me and the other witchers, we often wondered what his story was.
   1096300|00000000||A pity. A pity our story didn't end differently. I might have… I should have ridden out after him.
   1096302|00000000||Please don't mention me when next you see him. I've reopened my own wounds. That's enough.
   1096249|00000000||Vesemir's fine.
   1096251|00000000||How close were you?
   1096279|00000000||Don't mind at all. But before I answer, I also wouldn't mind knowing how you knew each other.
   1096281|00000000||Oh, I've told no one. Not ever. But I suppose I owe you an explanation.
   1096284|00000000||It was the winter of 1234. A beast prowled the streets of Oxenfurt. A fleder, I believe. A contract was issued, a notice posted, and a witcher appeared. Vesemir. Of the School of the Wolf.
   1096286|00000000||He came through our estate, tracking the beast. Our eyes met, something sparked. I wrote him a message, asked my governess to deliver it.
   1096288|00000000||He visited, under the cover of night, night after night. On one such occasion my father heard something. Vesemir had to flee, so quickly he left behind his gambeson.
   1096290|00000000||Ah! The first piece, the start of your collection.
   1096292|00000000||Yes. But also the end of our love. Father had an arrest warrant issued, then quickly married me off. I was fortunate - my husband died young, leaving me a sizeable fortune. And thus… I have lived on memories.
   1096233|00000000||…
   1096235|00000000||There's no earring out here, is there?
   1096237|00000000||None.
   1096239|00000000||Maybe the Countess'd care to explain what this is about? All jokes aside?
   1096241|00000000||Forgive me, I-- Gods, this is so embarrassing!
   1096244|00000000||Do--? Do you know Vesemir? He was a tinge shorter than you, wore a mustache…
   1096246|00000000||Do I know him? Man taught me everything I know!
   1096248|00000000||What--? How is he, if you don't mind my asking?
   1109776|00000000||What're you doing in a place like this?
   1109778|00000000||Best shoo before you get hurt.
   1118195|00000000||Shame you can't talk.
   1120875|00000000||What're you doing here?
   1093816|00000000||Step away. Authorized staff only.
   1107665|00000000||Ahem, ahem.
   1107513|00000000||Might I assist you?
   1107667|00000000||Yes. Yes…
   1107669|00000000||Now where did I put that gavel?
   1107671|00000000||I've thirty going thrice, thirty going frice-- No, that can't be right.
   1124027|00000000||Here's what we'll do. I'll go in, then help you sneak in around the back.
   1128161|00000000||How?
   1128163|00000000||Don't know. But I'll figure something out. Usually aren't nearly as many guards on the riverside.
   1124029|00000000||Agreed.
   1124031|00000000||All right. Let me in.
   1124018|00000000||Halt. By order of King Radovid, no one's allowed inside the Academy.
   1124020|00000000||Not even lecturers?
   1124022|00000000||No one means no one.
   1125966|00000000||See you've become quite the stickler, Norbert. You were much kinder when I was patching you up. By the way, how's your knee?
   1125968|00000000||Fine, dandy. As if no arrow ever struck it.
   1125970|00000000||Consider yourself a lucky man. 'Cause if I'd not decided to operate, you'd be a cripple to the end of your days.
   1126847|00000000||Ahem… Bruno?
   1126849|00000000||Eh?
   1124024|00000000||Maybe we ought to let her in? She's a decent lass, not like to steal nothin'.
   1125972|00000000||Hm, all right. But alone. Witcher'll draw too much attention. I'd rather not get shite from the captain on his account.
   1127334|00000000||Fire and blood, life and death.
   1127336|00000000||I summon ye whose blood I have brought.
   1127338|00000000||Fire and blood, life and death.
   1129253|00000000||You have summoned me, stranger. Why?
   1129255|00000000||Name's Geralt. Came to wake the ghost of Vlodimir von Everec.
   1129257|00000000||Who you are and why you've come matter little. For you'll not leave this place alive.
   1129259|00000000||Are you Vlod's ghost?
   1129262|00000000||Who asks after my grandson?
   1129984|00000000||It matters not, Honoratina. What I wonder is how this mortal obtained the family's blood. For von Everecs rise only for von Everec blood.
   1129265|00000000||True. Yet to my knowledge, only one of our line yet lives - Olgierd.
   1129267|00000000||Then we converse with the man who spilt the blood of your grandson, Kestatis.
   1129269|00000000||Mean none of you are Vlodimir? It's Olgierd, his brother, who sent me.
   1129271|00000000||You will meet Vlod soon enough. Yet Olgierd you will never see again.
   1112822|00000000||Kill him, von Everecs!
   1112824|00000000||For Olgierd's blood!
   1099167|00000000||Man in the cage - who's he?
   1099169|00000000||Dope in the cage - who's he?
   1099171|00000000||Why? Look like a monster to you? No? Then he's not your ploughin' concern.
   1114546|064a3568||Abner de Navarette
   1097520|00000000||Then let's return their coin to them.
   1097522|00000000||What would you return? We've spent it all! Every last copper!
   1098163|00000000||Well… you could, you know, find more.
   1098165|00000000||Of course, that's your solution! That's always your solution!
   1098487|00000000||Hit it square on.
   1097955|00000000||Not a bad shot with my crossbow. Why not. I'm in.
   1097957|00000000||Splendid! So, shall we begin? Folk have grown nervous.
   1097959|00000000||What? Mean now? No rehearsals?
   1097961|00000000||What's there to rehearse? You're to shoot and hit a target!
   1097952|00000000||Fine. I'll perform with you.
   1098405|00000000||Rather finance the refund.
   1098429|00000000||Fine. I'll pay.
   1098424|00000000||Hm. More, I think. I put it at six hundred at the least.
   1098426|00000000||What? But I checked this morning and-- Aaaa.
   1098428|00000000||Indeed, Meryn's right. Six hundred crowns.
   1098432|00000000||Way too much.
   1098431|00000000||Fine. I'll pay.
   1098024|00000000||We end with an audacious feat by Geralt of Rivia! We thank you for attending and hope to see you soon!
   1098026|00000000||It's a shame that man didn't shoot the elf. That would have been brilliant!
   1098503|00000000||You know, I doubted I'd emerge from that ordeal in one piece. Fine work, Geralt.
   1098028|00000000||Argh! He hit me! The bastard hit me!
   1098507|00000000||Woooooaaah! Brilliant!
   1098030|00000000||Ladies and gentlemen! With that, errr, singular feat we bring our performance to a close! See you all soon!
   1098032|00000000||Gonna live?
   1098511|00000000||Yes, I shall live! Argh… Out of my… sight, imbecile!
   1098513|00000000||Sorry. Told you I'm not a bad shot, not a perfect one.
   1098516|00000000||Oh, don't fret. Vann would miss occasionally, too. I shall patch Meryn up.
   1098034|00000000||Well, one performance down. What of the next?
   1098036|00000000||I'll let you know.
   1098042|00000000||I'll let you know.
   1098044|00000000||Hmm. Very well. I shall be waiting.
   1098048|00000000||Finally, you're back. So, what's it to be… our next performance?
   1098046|00000000||Oh? Back so soon? Well? Will we do it?
   1115059|00000000||Hm. Why not. Let's go.
   1115044|00000000||Why not. Let's go. Now.
   1098038|00000000||Herbalist, has a hut near here. Ring a bell? Go see him and ask for some yarrow extract.
   1098040|00000000||Oo, a mystery. I adore mysteries. Till later, witcher!
   1115045|00000000||Got some other things to tend to.
   1115061|00000000||Got some matters to tend to first. Rather meet you there.
   1115041|00000000||Got a hideout, herbalist's hut near Oxenfurt. Stone's throw away. Ask for extract of yarrow - he'll let you in.
   1115043|00000000||Hm.. Couldn't you just take me there?
   1098035|00000000||Yeah, you're hired. Go see the herbalist.
   1098455|00000000||Fine. I'll pay.
   1098458|00000000||Ho, ho. You must really need my help.
   1098460|00000000||Admit that freely. First off, though, I hate making a fool of myself in front of the rabble.
   1098462|00000000||So, what now? Might we prepare for the other show?
   1098404|00000000||Rather finance the refund.
   1097987|00000000||Give me a minute.
   1098001|00000000||Gimme a minute. Need to prepare.
   1098408|00000000||Know what? Need to think this through.
   1098410|00000000||Well, if you must, you must.
   1098406|00000000||Need to think about it.
   1097953|00000000||Maybe I could refund the tickets, instead?
   1097969|00000000||Hm, maybe I could just give you the coin for the refund? It'd be quicker. How much would that be?
   1097971|00000000||Hmm… let's see. Roundabout four hundred crowns, I believe.
   1098430|00000000||Hm. Way too much.
   1098434|00000000||Hmm… Steep.
   1098436|00000000||So perhaps you'd prefer to help with the show?
   1098190|00000000||The minute we're in trouble, you make me responsible for getting us out. As in Maribor! Remember Maribor?
   1097524|00000000||Dove, please don't change the subject.
   1097526|00000000||Mind if I do?
   1097528|00000000||That depends. Who might you be?
   1098193|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. Witcher. You Eveline Gallo? "The Ermine"?
   1098204|00000000||Only to friends.
   1098207|00000000||Calm down, Meryn, no need to puff up. And you, talk - what do you want?
   1098212|00000000||Rather talk eye to eye.
   1098214|00000000||Eveline conceals nothing from me, and--
   1098216|00000000||And you were to help set up the benches. Immediately.
   1098256|00000000||But--
   1098259|00000000||Very well, once again - what do you want?
   1098209|00000000||I'd prefer to speak to you privately.
   1098210|00000000||Wanted to ask you to work with me.
   1098261|00000000||Got a job for you.
   1098263|00000000||Truly? Of what nature?
   1098265|00000000||Hm. Anonymous performance. No audience. At a certain auction house.
   1098469|00000000||Pay's as much as you can carry.
   1098298|00000000||Eveline, I beg you… You don't know him!
   1098300|00000000||What's that supposed to mean? He introduced himself, did you not hear? Geralt of Rivia.
   1098306|00000000||Stop pretending you don't understand me. You cannot know if he's to be trusted!
   1098308|00000000||Not a soul can be trusted.
   1098312|00000000||Hm. You've none of a fink's features. But you see, I've a problem.
   1098328|00000000||All right, out with it. What's this problem?
   1098315|00000000||All ears. What is it?
   1097529|00000000||Lemme guess - got a monster needs killing?
   1097914|00000000||Lemme guess - there's a monster needs killing.
   1097916|00000000||Somewhere, certainly - but not here. May I finish? Or would you rather keep guessing?
   1097927|00000000||See, we were to do a show. The tickets have all sold. Alas, our friend and colleague, "Hawkeye" Vann… well, he's gone blind. Drank some hooch from a questionable source. A sad story, but not the point.
   1097929|00000000||The crowd awaits. So either we find a replacement for him, or we shall have to return the coin. All good and fine had we not spent it already.
   1097931|00000000||Ah. I think I know where this going.
   1098399|00000000||Then I shall get straight to the point. Stand in for Vann, and I shall help you.
   1098401|00000000||What do I have to do? Jump through some flaming hoops?
   1098403|00000000||No. Shoot your crossbow, hit a target.
   1098464|00000000||Eveline, I'm not certain that's a good idea.
   1098466|00000000||Neither am I. It shall all come out in the wash. So, witcher - what'll it be?
   1097999|00000000||Have you thought it out?
   1098471|00000000||Well? Ready?
   1097986|00000000||All right. Let's start.
   1098014|00000000||All right. Do or die. Let's begin.
   1098016|00000000||That I like! A man who boldly dares, damn the risks! Come!
   1098540|00000000||And now, good folk, the highlight of our program! Standing before you - Geralt of Rivia! Victor of marksmanship contests in Angren, Dol Blathanna and Lobinden!
   1098543|00000000||Wow! Prime!
   1098545|00000000||What? But I--
   1098547|00000000||Shh, Geralt. Grab your crossbow and get to work!
   1104978|00000000||This promises to be very interesting…
   1104980|00000000||When are we to start?
   1114910|00000000||Toley sufferin' fuck.
   1114900|00000000||Hell you want?
   1114902|00000000||Ye tit. Lookin' tae ire me?
   1114906|00000000||Geralt! Slice 'em! Slice the ball bags!
   1114908|00000000||Gonna split yer mug in twain.
   1114904|00000000||Ploughin' smash youse!
   1118840|00000000||The devil incarnate!
   1118842|00000000||He's castin' spells!
   1118846|00000000||Come 'ere, fucker! Come 'ere!
   1118848|00000000||You stink, heathen!
   1118854|00000000||It shall be over soon!
   1118844|00000000||Round and round the mulberry bush…
   1118850|00000000||Here, witcher, witcher!
   1118852|00000000||Blood for blood, brothers!
   1137640|00000000||Geralt needed someone who could scale the glass-smooth wall of the tower abutting the Borsodis' Auction House. One of the few capable of this was Hugo Hoff, alias "Beef Patty" – a halfling with countless break-ins and robberies under his belt. Geralt was told to look for him in Oxenfurt, whose seedy taverns served as watering grounds for students and criminals alike.<br>
   1137641|00000000||Sadly, it turned out Hugo Hoff was in no condition to join Geralt's crew. The halfling must have stepped on some powerful toes, for someone had slapped stone slippers on him and taken him for a long walk off a short pier – and into the Pontar.
   1137639|00000000||Hugo Hoff
   1115894|00000000||I'll tear you to shreds.
   1115896|00000000||I'll ssssuck the life out of you.
   1137609|48cfe7a3||Honoratina von Everec
   1108510|00000000||Don't leave me here! Help me!
   1108508|00000000||Help! Geralt, save me!
   1119205|00000000||Gotta look around.
   1129025|00000000||Man you patched up - is he here?
   1129027|00000000||Franz? I don't see him. Think the monster might've dragged him off?
   1129029|00000000||Could have.
   1122358|00000000||Hm. Beast probably crawled in or… out through here.
   1122360|00000000||It's deep.
   1119202|00000000||Lower level of the sewers has been closed off for years. But Vern, the commander, had a skeleton key.
   1119206|00000000||See if I can't find it.
   1119196|00000000||Need to look around.
   1110754|00000000||What exactly happened?
   1110756|00000000||We came in here and Miklas started looking for tracks. Then drowners attacked.
   1118987|00000000||The men made quick work of them, but Franz was injured. His leg. He and I stayed behind, I tried to bandage him up, while Nols stood watch.
   1118989|00000000||Then that beast appeared. Nols pushed me towards the exit and ran at the monster.
   1118991|00000000||I turned around and saw him lying there, covered in a sticky substance. I ran back to get him, then dragged him to where you found us.
   1118993|00000000||Where was the monster?
   1118995|00000000||Miklas and Vern had driven it away from us. And paid dearly for it.
   1118997|00000000||Manage to get a look at what attacked you?
   1119005|00000000||Everything happened so fast. I didn't get a good look, no - only saw it from behind. I know it was large and… slimy.
   1104883|00000000||What exactly happened here?
   1104882|00000000||You friends with them?
   1104886|00000000||Know them well?
   1104888|00000000||Him I met this morning. But Vern and I served together at the Battle of Dorian.
   1104890|00000000||Miklas only enlisted this Yule.
   1104892|00000000||Sorry.
   1104894|00000000||Once you kill this beast, we'll have to send someone down here to collect their bodies. Give them a proper burial.
   1093138|00000000||Soldiers from your escort?
   1104880|00000000||Yes, that's them. Vern, Miklas… poor boys.
   1119198|00000000||Beast doesn't play around, apparently.
   1119200|00000000||They saved my life…
   1104896|00000000||Fresh bruises on the bodies. From a blunt, heavy object.
   1104899|00000000||And no cuts.
   1106720|00000000||Mhm. A few scratches. And everyone's covered in the same strange slime…
   1110788|00000000||Interesting. See that wet spot on the ground?
   1110790|00000000||Mhm. It leads into that channel.
   1110792|00000000||Monster must've come in through there. And left the same way.
   1119009|00000000||Any idea what might've killed them?
   1119011|00000000||Not yet. For now, my bet's on something big. A zeugl, maybe.
   1119013|00000000||Need to find its lair.

   1128309|00000000||Tenteen…
   1128311|00000000||You mean twenty, idiot. Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four…

   1128337|00000000||Fifty-six, fifty-seven, fifty-eight, fifty-nine…
   1128339|00000000||And sixty. Sixty-one, sixty-two, sixty-three, sixty-four…

   1128372|00000000||Ninety-eight. Ninety-nine…
   1128374|00000000||A hundred.
   1128376|00000000||One fucking hundred.
   1128378|00000000||What now?
   1128380|00000000||No fuckin' clue, brother.
   1127919|00000000||Lookin' for trouble, are you?
   1127913|00000000||What's this? Order of the Flaming Rose have a new seat? Not too shabby…
   1127915|00000000||You listen, vagrant. Don't know why you're here, but take my advice - go back to wherever you come from.
   1127917|00000000||So? Why're you still standin' there? I need to smash your pate in?
   1128014|00000000||Wanna fight? Fine by me.
   1125415|00000000||Three.
   1128018|00000000||Don't like your tone, brother.
   1128020|00000000||Odd. See, I thought I was bein' polite. But if courtesy don't work, we'll try somethin' else.
   1128013|00000000||Don't like your tone. Change it.
   1125445|00000000||I was never here.
   1125451|00000000||See ya.
   1125447|00000000||What's inside?
   1128157|00000000||Wondering what you got inside. 'Cause it reeks of fisstech to me. Mind if I have a look… brethren?
   1128159|00000000||Aye, we'd mind. Very much so.
   1128006|00000000||Enough o' these games. I'm countin' to three and you're gonna be gone when I'm done, got it? One. Two.
   1128022|00000000||How would you like to count to a larger number? Using Novigrad crowns. That strike your fancy?
   1128025|00000000||Well… yeah, what do I care? Go on in.
   1128016|00000000||Easy. Let's talk this out.
   1128015|00000000||Out of my way, dimwits.
   1125417|00000000||Got a better idea. You're all gonna count to a hundred. Got it?
   1128009|00000000||Three, four, five, six…
   1128011|00000000||Great start. Now step aside.
   1128432|00000000||Errrr…
   1128430|00000000||Lippy fucker! Get him!
   1128434|00000000||Uhhh…
   1133954|d90a0eff||Circus Worker
   1137148|00000000||As is often the case in life, Eveline was willing to help, but only in exchange for a favor: the witcher had to save her circus troupe from humiliation. He duly performed the required feat, and the limber elfess then joined the break-in crew.<br>
   1137149|00000000||Eveline Gallo performed as tasked and guided Geralt and his accomplices into the auction house. Yet as soon as the heist stopped going according to plan and Redanian soldiers surrounded the auction house, she shimmied up and out the chimney and was never seen by Geralt again.<br>
   1137635|00000000||To rob a vault, one must force open armor-plated doors and secret away mounds of loot. First and foremost, however, one needs to get inside the building containing said vault. To accomplish this, Geralt could use the help of a certain Eveline Gallo – a circus performer famed through all the North, and who, it seemed, used her considerable talents for less law-abiding purposes as well...<br>
   1137147|00000000||Eveline Gallo
   1095152|00000000||Had enough, lordlin'?
   1102140|00000000||That'll teach you to woo and dupe decent maids. Got my eye on you.
   1117082|00000000||Nesky! Let's go!
   1102150|00000000||Listen. Tongue and fists on a leash from now on. Have your fun, but don't beat the wedding guests. With my hands.
   1111863|00000000||Fine. I shall try.
   1116211|00000000||Uh-oh, Shani approaches. Unlikely to be happy, eh?
   1116213|00000000||You made this mess, you do the explaining.
   1116215|00000000||Oh, all right…
   1116217|00000000||Your methods - quite unusual. To woo a woman by beating up her brothers - creative. Wonder what else you have up your sleeve.
   1116219|00000000||All went according to plan.
   1116238|00000000||Eliminating potential obstacles, see - all part of my plan. Usually, I take a few passing blows in the doing, and the young miss in question then swoons with pity, tends to my wounds…
   1116240|00000000||So what went wrong?
   1116242|00000000||It's this damned malformed body. All sinews. And this mug… were I to wear my own, oh, 'twould be another story altogether.
   1116244|00000000||The maidens always fell for my melancholy eyes and the swagger in my scars… but I'll gladly try again, just indicate a lass and--
   1116299|00000000||I can demonstrate if you'd like…
   1116305|00000000||My dear girl, what don't I have up my sleeve! I'd gladly demonstrate… perhaps behind the barn?
   1116307|00000000||I think you've demonstrated enough. Let's just enjoy ourselves, all right? You don't have all that much time left.
   1116309|00000000||Your wish is my command, m'lady. I'd never deny a maid so fair-featured. Off we go.
   1118949|00000000||Time for the capping. We need to get to the barn.
   1118951|00000000||Go. I require a last hurrah.
   1118953|00000000||All the guests must be present for the capping. That includes you.
   1116235|00000000||You've proven everything amply. Let's just have fun, all right? After all, you haven't much time left.
   1116248|00000000||Ehh, fine, I suppose you're right. Come, then.
   1116223|00000000||A hazard of the trade, my love. I'm clearly a bit out of practice.
   1116225|00000000||But point out the next young miss, and I will gladly prove I--
   1116218|00000000||I'm out of practice.
   1095162|00000000||Where to, my love? I was to turn you into a lady!
   1102148|00000000||Geralt, you must explain I was not at fault. They lunged at me. Well? Go on, chase her!
   1125007|00000000||In your dreams.
   1125009|00000000||There it is. You fucked up. She's gone. Is that how you woo the ladies?
   1125011|00000000||You always that charming in life?
   1125013|00000000||It worked more often than not.
   1095150|00000000||Had enough, peasant spawn? Thought yourself a match for a von Everec -- I mean, a witcher?
   1102138|00000000||Away with you, begone! I've tired of looking at your slackjawed yaps!
   1121398|00000000||Feel foolish, peasants? Learned a lesson from your better. Are the pigs penned? Indeed they are!
   1121253|00000000||What's wrong, witcher? Swineherd's Dash no longer interest you?
   1121255|00000000||We're to leave the sty? I thought you liked these gritty, manly games.
   1121291|00000000||Vlodimir von Everec never gives up! I'll try again - that crown shall be mine!
   1121288|00000000||I shall try again.
   1121289|00000000||I've had enough of these swine.
   1121311|00000000||Had enough of this swiving swining. Pigs are best as pork on your plate.
   1121313|00000000||Come away with me, Shani.
   1121382|00000000||See that? Bloke thinks our sport ain't good enough for him.
   1121479|00000000||Be singin' a different tune if he'd been any good at it.
   1121481|00000000||Right y'are. Like my pa always said, "When shite can't swim, it blames the runny water."
   1122261|00000000||Forgive me, Shani. I've let you down.
   1122263|00000000||Are you worried about that pig? You needn't be…
   1122265|00000000||We're here as a couple, I wanted to win you that… that thing…
   1122269|00000000||Really, it's unimportant, nothing at all.
   1116108|00000000||I'm on the prowl - that's clear. I woo and woo, yet you do not succumb. So I can't help but wonder - what am I doing wrong?
   1095083|00000000||Now who have we here?
   1102089|00000000||Do I know you?
   1095085|00000000||That's the crux of it - we've not met. I've had to endure half a lifetime without you.
   1102091|00000000||An entire lifetime, more like.
   1116129|00000000||A moment, my dear.
   1116132|00000000||Do not sabotage me, Shani. That would not be fair.
   1116134|00000000||Fine, fine. I'll stay out of your way.
   1122113|00000000||Did it hurt when you fell from the heavens?
   1122219|00000000||Did it hurt terribly, my sweet?
   1122221|00000000||What?
   1122223|00000000||When you fell from the heavens.
   1122225|00000000||Oh, hahaha. Why, sir, I-- Haha…
   1122227|00000000||Shh, my dear. No more words.
   1123494|00000000||Forgive me, I didn't know.
   1095095|00000000||Easy, lads. No harm done. An innocent conversation with an innocent miss. The kind weddings are for.
   1102126|00000000||We all heard your innocent talk. Wanted to draw her to the barn. What were you gonna do there? Talk some more?
   1116141|00000000||Naturally, we would speak, but first we would dance. Now tell me, what sort of fool wouldn't want to dance with a beauty like her?
   1116143|00000000||Find another beauty! Or I'll dance with you meself - just after I grab me a fence post!
   1111575|00000000||Geralt, you saw it - I tried to resolve this peacefully, but they wish to fight. Suits me just fine - sounds like wonderful fun. Fence boards right over there for the taking.
   1111577|00000000||Fear eat your stones?
   1111579|00000000||That's the last ploughing straw. No one accuses Vlodimir von Everec of cowardice!
   1102128|00000000||Calm down, boys. Don't wanna fight you.
   1095097|00000000||Too damn bad. 'Cause we're gonna tan your mutant-freak hide!
   1111581|00000000||That does it. Rraa, hy-ah!
   1112987|00000000||Show us what you got!
   1112989|00000000||Hot damn, boy! You needn't ask me twice!
   1095091|00000000||You shan't keep me from anything, filthy hayseed.
   1111572|00000000||Lads… mutant's callin' us names.
   1095093|00000000||Stand down, swineherds. Or lord witcher will give you a bloody mighty drubbing. Now where's a ploughing fence board when you need it?!
   1123493|00000000||You'll do nothing of the sort, bumpkin.
   1102117|00000000||I shall make a true lady of you. Arm in arm, we'll grace the finest salons.
   1116137|00000000||Salons? But, really? Actual salons? In Novigrad? And how…?
   1116139|00000000||In Novigrad, Oxenfurt, why, in Kovir as well! Wherever you wish. Let's make haste to the barn. There everything will be made clear.
   1095087|00000000||Nesky, step away from the man.
   1102120|00000000||Who the devils are you?
   1102122|00000000||We're the miss' brothers. And we swore to our da on his dyin' day we'd keep those of your ilk far from her.
   1122115|00000000||Ahem, my sweet, you are no mere maid, but a marvel of nature! And now, at last, fate knocks at your door!
   1122117|00000000||But I… well… don't know, rightly…
   1122119|00000000||You needn't know anything. I know it all for us both.
   1122112|00000000||My dear girl, you are a miracle.
   1116115|00000000||Hm. Perhaps you're just not my type. Considered that?
   1116117|00000000||Rubbish! I'm every lass' type.
   1116119|00000000||Is that so? Prove it.
   1116121|00000000||With pleasure! Show me a lass, and I'll have her eating out of my hand in the blink of an eye!
   1116124|00000000||That one. With the garland.
   1116126|00000000||Splendid choice! Now observe as Vlodimir von Everec does his thing.
   1116110|00000000||I'm on the prowl - that's clear. In Geralt's name and flesh, of course, but still. Yet the more I woo you, the less you seem ready to succumb. So I ask myself - what am I missing?
   1116104|00000000||Hmm, tell me, Shani - what's the key with you?
   1116106|00000000||What do you mean?
   1122253|00000000||How does my heart's captor like the, uh… prize... I won for her?
   1122255|00000000||The rag-stuffed piggy? It's lovely, truly. I've always dreamed of owning one.
   1121421|00000000||Master witcher, we ain't seen such pig-chasin' skill in a long time.
   1121423|00000000||Your family had an ample pen, didn't they? Go on, admit it.
   1121425|00000000||My family had many pens. But that in no way means I had any practice chasing pigs.
   1121427|00000000||However it were, the crown's goin' to a good man!
   1122251|00000000||And the king's chosen maid deserves a fitting favor. Here.
   1121430|00000000||Just don't go hidin' it in some pouch. Brandish it on your horse, so that all folk may see!
   1121433|00000000||What do you say to that, Shani? Ever witness such agility?
   1121435|00000000||You're clearly a natural at chasing pigs through muck. You were a joy to watch.
   1121408|00000000||Whoa, master witcher. What were the trickery back there, the fancy finger twistin'?
   1121410|00000000||I know. Seen that afore. Witcher told a lad to go hang himself. Drew some flowers in the air with his hand, and the man lost his mind.
   1121412|00000000||Meanin' you cheated. And shan't be crowned King o' the Swineherds.
   1121415|00000000||Shani? What is it Geralt says in these situations? "Dammit"?
   1121417|00000000||Yes, that's it.
   1121419|00000000||Dammit!
   1122109|00000000||Now for what I say - go shove rakes up your arses, you peasant curs!
   1122111|00000000||Do I look anything like a swineherd? Come, Shani. I've had enough of these hayseeds…
   1095192|00000000||Damned cretin creamed me. Embarrassing to take a licking from a boor.
   1095194|00000000||And with a maiden watching…
   1095176|00000000||Fence boards! The perfect weapon for sweaty-arsed swineherds!
   1095178|00000000||Perfect fit for your gob, you ploughin' gentle-fuck!
   1095180|00000000||Never in my life have I reveled so fiercely! Step up, who else wants a shave?!
   1112655|00000000||Ahh, so good to shake the kinks from one's bones.
   1112657|00000000||We must find more, more fun.
   1109550|00000000||Gotta be her… Dammit.
   1109552|00000000||You wished to see her - here she is.
   1109554|00000000||A man should frame his wishes carefully. It forestalls disappointment.
   1131055|00000000||This some sick joke? Why didn't you tell me she was dead right away?
   1131057|00000000||You didn't ask.
   1111107|00000000||Ugh… And why hasn't anyone buried her?
   1111109|00000000||We can't. As for the Caretaker, the one you cut down, while still alive she ordered him to stay away from her for all time.
   1098580|00000000||Iris' wrath - what was it born of?
   1098741|00000000||Her ghost's restless, angry. Attacks intruders. Know why?
   1098751|00000000||Lady von Everec has endured much hardship. She's unaccustomed to guests and not fond of strange folk.
   1099698|00000000||She can't hear us.
   1131097|00000000||Why are you helping me?
   1131107|00000000||The deeper I get into this, the more I gotta wonder… why're you even helping me?
   1131136|00000000||We were summoned to serve Iris von Everec. Our mistress died, but that did not free us from her service.
   1131138|00000000||Got it. You wanna leave this place… leave these bodies.
   1131140|00000000||Surprised?
   1131142|00000000||No. Not at all.
   1101265|00000000||Seems I gotta speak to Iris' ghost.
   1101267|00000000||It's no easy task to contact the mistress. Rage and bitterness fill her.
   1128594|00000000||Got my ways. To make contact with Iris, I gotta bury her body. But that Caretaker's macabre little cemetery won't do. Too much blood, too much fear.
   1128596|00000000||She spent much time in the front garden…
   1101285|00000000||Hm. Maybe there.
   1128598|00000000||Wait. Take this key. It opens the front door.
   1131188|00000000||Good dog.
   1098725|00000000||Need to talk to Iris' ghost.
   1098593|00000000||How did she die?
   1099700|00000000||How did she die? Don't see any wounds, evidence of a fight.
   1100298|00000000||Her heart burst.
   1100300|00000000||Meaning what? A heart attack?
   1100302|00000000||No. It simply burst.
   1131099|00000000||Find that hard to believe.
   1131101|00000000||Yet that's precisely what happened. One day Iris locked the front door, lay down here and… died. From grief, from loneliness.
   1108566|00000000||Bedchamber… Iris was supposed to be here…
   1093186|00000000||This place seems suitable…
   1111146|00000000||Yes. She loved to paint.
   1101708|00000000||Did Iris von Everec have any last requests? Say how she wanted her remains disposed of?
   1101710|00000000||She feared death. Worried none would see to her burial or say a kind word in parting.
   1101729|00000000||Guess I'll be the one to do that.
   1101374|00000000||Can't say much about Iris von Everec. But I do know I like her paintings.
   1101376|00000000||It's a shame her art couldn't bring her greater comfort.
   1101339|00000000||Iris von Everec was a talented painter…
   1101507|00000000||I didn't know Iris von Everec, but the paintings here show amply that she and Olgierd were a loving couple.
   1101509|00000000||Iris must've been happy, once.
   1101340|00000000||Iris was Olgierd von Everec's wife…
   1101338|00000000||I didn't know Iris von Everec…
   1101358|00000000||I didn't know Iris von Everec, so I can't say much about her.
   1101479|00000000||Fate had it a stranger now lays her remains in the grave.
   1140117|00000000||At times fate muddles our path, and life turns toilsome, hard to bear.
   1101370|00000000||Yet all deserve respite and peace in death.
   1101510|00000000||[Place her sketchpad on the grave.]
   1101531|00000000||Your name's inscribed in this sketchbook.
   1101541|00000000||Perhaps you'd like it to be buried with you.
   1101511|00000000||[Place the painting of Iris and Olgierd on the grave.]
   1101543|00000000||I don't know if you want to be buried with a painting of your husband.
   1101545|00000000||But you lived together, so maybe you want to be with him in death as well.
   1111212|00000000||[Place the ornamented hairbrush on the grave.]
   1111214|00000000||I can't be sure this brush was yours.
   1111216|00000000||But if you liked pretty trinkets, you might not mind this one lying at your side.
   1109706|00000000||The remains are interred. Let's summon her.
   1131194|00000000||Tormented spirit! I've laid your bones to rest! Forget your wrath, forget your grief! Show yourself!
   1109708|00000000||Forgive me for tearing you from your realm. I need to ask you…
   1101528|00000000||Should I follow you? All right.
   1101520|00000000||Let's try to summon her.
   1101529|00000000||You two got anything to add?
   1101547|00000000||You two - got any last words for your mistress?
   1101549|00000000||We don't partake in human rituals.
   1101551|00000000||Trusting that what you've done is in keeping with your customs.
   1098578|00000000||You know the master of the house, the owner?
   1098585|00000000||Olgierd von Everec? Yes, we know him. But he left, and his wife became mistress of the house.
   1098649|00000000||Great. So, Lady von Everec home? Could you announce me, say she has a guest?
   1100426|00000000||Why do you wish to see her?
   1098776|00000000||I'm here to get the violet rose Olgierd gave Iris just before he left.
   1098653|00000000||Iris is inside. In the bedchamber upstairs. Take his key… it opens the rear door.
   1098655|00000000||Guess I'll make my own introductions.
   1097574|00000000||Looking for a violet rose.
   1098473|00000000||What about this thing? What can you tell me? Friend of yours?
   1099692|00000000||We called him the Caretaker.
   1116832|00000000||Doesn't look like any creature I've ever seen. Where'd it come from?
   1099694|00000000||From very far away. He was summoned to guard Lady Iris and the home. He tended the garden, took care of unwanted guests.
   1116838|00000000||"Very far away" - meaning where, exactly?
   1116840|00000000||The name of this place would mean naught to you.
   1098758|00000000||The creature - what was it?
   1097575|00000000||You two are a little mysterious.
   1097800|00000000||What's with the show? The pretense that you're animals. You couldn't have warned me?
   1098615|00000000||No. We're obliged to maintain discretion.
   1097804|00000000||So why talk to me at all?
   1097806|00000000||Why…? Well, we get so few chances to talk to humans. And we're curious to know what brought you.
   1116848|00000000||Gonna need a better answer than that.
   1116850|00000000||Later.
   1097158|00000000||What the fuck was that?
   1100419|00000000||No eyes or nostrils, deformed organs… Damn thing had no right to be alive.
   1097567|00000000||Well… philosophers do still debate what it means to be "alive," exactly.
   1097569|00000000||Normally, I'd be shocked, but… not after what I just saw. Who are you two?
   1097571|00000000||Clearly not animals. Think of us as… friends of the house.
   1107069|00000000||She liked to sit here. But this is not a good place for a grave.
   1138263|00000000||Too close to the house.
   1138265|00000000||I'll keep searching.
   1109628|00000000||Iris von Everec adored flowers.
   1138267|00000000||But she would never want to destroy them.
   1131105|00000000||Hm, all right. I'll dig the grave somewhere else.
   1113745|00000000||Hey, witcher! How 'bout joinin' our band?
   1113770|00000000||What a pickle…
   1113743|00000000||You've seen war, mate. And it shows.
   1113747|00000000||Rein her in, squire!
   1113751|00000000||Grub and hooch - life in a nutshell.
   1113749|00000000||You all right, friend?
   1113753|00000000||Tosser!
   1126041|00000000||What demon?
   1126078|00000000||What demon?
   1126080|00000000||Feigned ignorance? Hmph. Please. You know.
   1126082|00000000||Gaunter O'Dimm… Evil incarnate.
   1128287|00000000||He didn't send me, but he is why I'm here.
   1130176|00000000||Thanks. Helped me a lot.
   1130178|00000000||Good. Very good. Ah, to feel useful after so many years locked up, living in fear - why, it's pleasance itself.
   1130170|00000000||Thanks for your help.
   1130172|00000000||How can I get rid of this mark?
   1130257|00000000||O'Dimm left a mark on my face. Any way to get it off?
   1130259|00000000||A mark? No mention in the tomes… Strange… Unless… unless it will disappear once your pact is fulfilled.
   1130263|00000000||If I challenge him, end the pact that way - will it go away?
   1130265|00000000||That I do not know. The one man who's succeeded bore no mark.
   1126269|00000000||Why was Olgierd out to get rid of O'Dimm? He'd gotten what he wanted.
   1126271|00000000||Had he? Hmph. His heart had turned cold as ice. His feelings for his wife, for whom he'd sacrificed his brother, had withered. He'd lost all he'd loved. Had he wanted any of this?
   1126273|00000000||No. O'Dimm grants what you wish, not what you want. All who sign a pact learn the difference - and die by it.
   1126275|00000000||All? No way to get rid of him?
   1126277|00000000||Kill him, you mean? Kill Evil? Hmph. No. Yet the annals tell of a man who dissolved his pact - by defeating O'Dimm at his own game.
   1126279|00000000||Meaning?
   1126281|00000000||O'Dimm wields contracts, word-traps, duels of wits. Challenge him to such a duel. He'll agree - and can be beaten. But remember, there is only ever one stake. The sole thing he truly desires - human souls.
   1126267|00000000||Olgierd wanted to break his pact. Why?
   1126885|00000000||Olgierd tell you all that?
   1126887|00000000||He had to. How else was I to diagnose his case?
   1126889|00000000||Make it sound like an illness.
   1126891|00000000||It is worse. Many illnesses are treatable, but play with evil… and medicine can be much harder to find.
   1126883|00000000||You know all this from Olgierd?
   1126222|00000000||Vlodimir - did Olgierd kill him?
   1126219|00000000||So, did Olgierd kill his own brother?
   1126221|00000000||No, no, no… Deduce, witcher. O'Dimm acts directly or indirectly? Hm? Olgierd merely signed the blood letter, the next day his brother was dead…
   1126195|00000000||Olgierd sign one of these pacts with him?
   1126197|00000000||Brilliant deduction. But have you guessed why? You must know he came from a wealthy, influential line. He must have if the family of his betrothed accepted him.
   1126199|00000000||Yet did you know his fortunes soured? He himself became an outcast, impoverished. Iris' family, a powerful house, could not accept this, would not marry their daughter to a nobody.
   1126201|00000000||Olgierd wished to elope - the further away, the better. Yet Iris refused to cut her family ties.
   1126203|00000000||Quite the predicament.
   1126205|00000000||Indeed. Their luck turned yet darker when a wandering witch mentioned a solution - a man who would grant any wish. His name - Master Mirror.
   1126207|00000000||The rest follows naturally. Olgierd and O'Dimm - a meeting at a crossroads, a wish, a pact signed in blood, and a price to be paid.
   1126209|00000000||Olgierd was to sacrifice one he loved… O'Dimm delights in difficult choices. He knew Olgierd loved two in this world - his betrothed, and his brother, Vlodimir…
   1126258|00000000||Olgierd chose, and soon thereafter married his beloved Iris, his fortune restored…
   1126192|00000000||Olgierd make one of these pacts with him?
   1128360|00000000||Know anything else about the man?
   1128362|00000000||Gaunter O'Dimm is no man! He is Evil! Evil which assumes various forms. Forget about him, or die.
   1128364|00000000||You're alive.
   1128366|00000000||Alive… yet I live in constant fear born of what I've learned about him.
   1128358|00000000||What else do you know about him?
   1126193|00000000||Magic circle on the floor - what's that about?
   1126211|00000000||What's with the surroundings? These runes - what do they mean?
   1126213|00000000||They protect me. Here, Evil cannot touch me.
   1126215|00000000||How do you know?
   1126217|00000000||He told me himself. Paid me a visit once. A fascinating meeting that was. I was blind already but saw him clearly. He smiled at me.
   1126260|00000000||Said he was honored I'd taken such an interest in him. He wished to thank me and explained he'd taken a similar interest in me.
   1126262|00000000||He drew the circle and said I'd be safe within it. His way of "repaying" me, you see…
   1126264|00000000||Ever tried to leave it?
   1126266|00000000||If you'd heard how he said it, you'd be as certain as I am what leaving would bring.
   1126084|00000000||Came here 'cause I need information. Think you might be the only man who has it.
   1126086|00000000||Hm, a witcher. Then it follows I needn't fear. I'm hardly a post-Conjunction creature.
   1126177|00000000||What did Olgierd von Everec want from you?
   1126179|00000000||I curse the day I first set eyes upon the man!
   1126181|00000000||He appeared at my doorstep one day, offering a sack of gold were I only to find out who Gaunter O'Dimm is, and how to get rid of him.
   1126183|00000000||I agreed. Such matters are my speciality. And I needed the coin. I pored over countless tomes, delved into obscure incidents and analyzed folk legends.
   1126185|00000000||I went so far as to travel to Nilfgaard, the library there, where at last I hit upon the mysterious entity's trail.
   1126187|00000000||There are records of encounters dating back thousands of years, in many cultures, under many names. But always as Evil incarnate. In this land we call him Gaunter O'Dimm. At times, Master Mirror, or the Man of Glass.
   1126189|00000000||In deciphering the ancient scrawlings I went blind. Yet I learned a great deal. For example, that he plays with his victims. And thrives on pacts above all else.
   1126191|00000000||Seemingly harmless contracts which drive their parties to madness.
   1126050|00000000||Came to talk.
   1126051|00000000||You a prisoner here?
   1126096|00000000||Why are there guards outside your door? You a prisoner?
   1126098|00000000||"Protective custody," that's the phrase. Protective, hmph! When I cannot decide my own fate, cannot breathe without their permission.
   1126100|00000000||What do they want from you?
   1126102|00000000||You may not be aware, but I am one of the foremost experts on the occult. Living experts, that is. My mentor was the outstanding Professor Lionel van--
   1126104|00000000||And you're cooperating with the witch hunters now?
   1126106|00000000||Cooperating, hmph! As if I had a choice. They're ignorant, but not enough to ignore what I know about magic, witches, sorceresses, what have you. Knowledge they use for barbaric ends, but that's beyond my control.
   1126047|00000000||I'm a witcher.
   1126049|00000000||Hm, a mutant? Hm, hm… Yeah… could be…
   1126043|00000000||No one sent me.
   1126045|00000000||You lie. I may be blind, but I sense unclean powers better than anyone. Why do you think the witch hunters guard me like a treasure?
   1126040|00000000||No one sent me.
   1126877|00000000||Franco? Is that you? Leave the bedpan in the usual spot.
   1126879|00000000||And take the platter, I shan't be eating today.
   1126034|00000000||Professor Shakeslock?
   1124168|00000000||Who the blazes--?! How'd you get in?! Get out! I know nothing. Don't wish to know anything. Understand?! No, no, no - out!
   1126037|00000000||Not gonna hurt you.
   1126039|00000000||That demon sent you. I'm sure of it!
   1137727|00000000||Poor wretch…
   1095598|00000000||What do they call you?
   1095600|00000000||Geralt of Rivia.
   1095602|00000000||Bit of advice, Geralt of Rivia. Once you meet Olgierd, try and pique his interest.
   1095604|00000000||I gotta pique his interest? He's the one wants a monster dead.
   1095606|00000000||Aye - but he don't need you to kill it.
   1095608|00000000||So, you want this job, you gotta grab his attention. And he's one to get bored mighty quick.
   1095144|00000000||Gotcha.
   1135556|00000000||Ouw se on coq é coq là sé rwa an lè pil fimié ay.
   1135558|00000000||Shen ggonia monerie, ara scdebi.
   1135560|00000000||Man amaran nai. Nir sauyn fala fashtama azdahznan.
   1135564|00000000||Begone. You've lost.
   1095146|00000000||Gggrrrraaaaaggghhhhhaaaarrrr!
   1113929|00000000||In a certain cellar located near a nest of drowners, Geralt found a body. Quite curiously, the deceased had not been torn apart by the monsters, but seemed to have died of thirst, having been barricaded in the cellar by some third party. Near the body Geralt found a key and some notes, all of which he took with him.<br>
   1113930|00000000||Geralt had found his fair share of hidden treasure before, so he found the chest without too much difficulty and took its contents for himself.
   1113931|00000000||From the notes Geralt learned about a treasure hidden in a locked chest on a ship. He suspected the key to that chest was the very one he had found by the body.<br>
   1113932|00000000||Find the sunken ship using your Witcher Senses.
   1113933|00000000||Read Brother Anselm's letter.
   1113928|00000000||The Sword, Famine and Perfidy
   1134611|00000000||Think I placed it wrong.
   1132239|00000000||A scrap of paper… Part of a document?
   1132241|00000000||And one more …
   1132245|00000000||And another …
   1132247|00000000||Another piece…
   1132243|00000000||Another one …
   1132255|00000000||No. Something's wrong…
   1132267|00000000||So this is when he started smoking…
   1132249|00000000||Iris' father was holding the document. Gotta put the pieces in his hand.
   1132263|00000000||So that's how he whiled away the long winter evenings…
   1093230|00000000||Furthermore, it is agreed that Iris shall be accorded the respect she is owed, that you shall heed her counsel and requests, and--
   1104050|00000000||Get to the point, father. My patience runs thin.
   1105161|00000000||Gladly. On Iris' request, I declare this marriage null and void.
   1105251|00000000||You vowed to remain with me "till death do us part."
   1105253|00000000||And I've held to my vow. The Olgierd I married is no more.
   1111883|00000000||Breaking a word once given does not come that easy. Believe me.
   1117013|00000000||You shall stay here. Forever.
   1117015|00000000||Enough! You will not command us, you will--
   1105256|00000000||Father! Father! Nooo!!
   1105258|00000000||Servants! Take this carcass and feed it to the beasts!
   1132261|00000000||Hmm… Nope.
   1122878|00000000||Olgierd, Iris… and her father?
   1132265|00000000||Drained… to the last drop.
   1132253|00000000||Not quite. Memory's still incomplete.
   1132251|00000000||Hmm… a marriage contract between Iris and Olgierd…
   1127402|00000000||Her father must've been holding the contract…
   1132259|00000000||So that's how he whiled away the long winter evenings…
   1132269|00000000||A knife… covered in blood. Guess Olgierd got the scars on his shoulders that winter…
   1132257|00000000||A beer tankard… but there was vodka in it.
   1126297|00000000||Tools're so organized it's scary.
   1126299|00000000||Looks like someone cleaned it. Recently.
   1126301|00000000||Fresh manure.
   1126303|00000000||A grave? Here?
   1126323|00000000||Someone dragged a wounded man through here.
   1112780|00000000||Prints from cleated boots. Leading from the back of the garden.
   1126390|00000000||Rope looks new, bucket's been repaired.
   1126421|00000000||Seeds and bulbs. Someone's still planting flowers.
   1129976|00000000||Another intruder buried by the caretaker.
   1132172|00000000||A lock pick? Must've been the other thief's…
    478294|add692ad||Thug
   1100557|00000000||Well, here's where our Paths part.
   1100569|00000000||Shut up.
   1100573|00000000||Was I that bad?
   1100825|00000000||No. But you came awfully close, Ewald. Survived by a hair.
   1100837|00000000||You ever have a basilisk hide or fiend horns and want a good price? Look for me at the auction house!
   1100839|00000000||Mhm. Consider it noted.
   1100829|00000000||Take care, Casimir. Here's hoping Euphemia sees the light, comes back.
   1100832|00000000||Och, plough her moods and ires. With the gold I've got, "love" just ain't nothin' I need.
   1100834|00000000||Heheh. In that case, you and your coin purse live happily ever after.
   1093170|00000000||Pretty sprawling, this estate.
   1102143|00000000||How'm I gonna find that rose in this fog?
   1111607|00000000||Somebody's still taking care of the place.
   1111609|00000000||Gardener's hut. Could it be…?
   1112388|00000000||No violet rose here. Maybe somewhere out back.
   1115288|00000000||Mhm?
   1115284|00000000||Greetings, greetings.
   1115286|00000000||Whoa now!
    473973|ce818cc2||Princess
   1104540|c775c284||Quinto
   1128281|00000000||Where'd you get the rope?
   1128283|00000000||Long story.
   1124107|00000000||But we've done well. Professor Shakeslock's house is at the end of this street.
   1124109|00000000||Witch hunters guard the door. Doubt I'll be able to sweet talk them.
   1124111|00000000||Been a huge help already, Shani. Thanks.
   1125980|00000000||It was nothing, really. You'd have done the same for me.
   1124113|00000000||If you wish to see me again before I go, I'll be at home. Packing'll take some time yet.
   1124115|00000000||All right. Be seeing you.
   1128174|00000000||Geralt! Psst! Are you there?
   1128176|00000000||Yeah, I'm here.
   1124033|00000000||Grab the line!
   1128184|00000000||Geralt! Coming or not?
   1128186|00000000||Yeah, hold on.
   1095629|00000000||Vimme, listen. Forgot to ask you - how's this auction going to work?
   1095631|00000000||They'll bring out three lots to start with. Once they've sold - or not - there'll be an intermission. Horst Borsodi'll probably appear then. That's when I'll introduce youse.
   1095633|00000000||Counting on it.
   1095635|00000000||In the meantime, have ye got a budget? Ye prepared to bid?
   1096813|00000000||O' course, pal! And at a very favorable rate of interest! Just one crown on ten when ye pay me back.
   1097156|00000000||Here. Ought to do you for a bit of dafferie. Happy huntin' to ye!
   1096805|00000000||Hmm, if you think you can spot me a couple hundred…
   1096779|00000000||If you can spot me a couple hundred.
   1095703|00000000||Esteemed ladies and gentlemen! Welcome back! I hereby open the auction!

   1096880|00000000||[Do not bid.]
   1097071|00000000||Good folk, is no one tempted? Atypical in style, true, but worthy of the vestibule, surely!

   1097171|00000000||So how goes it, Geralt? Didnae find it irksome, I hope?
   1097173|00000000||Course I did. As always with sophisticated company. But, it was about what I expected, so…
   1097180|00000000||Geralt, I hope that painting's no source of grief. Quite the opportunity, that.
   1097182|00000000||Mhm. Couldn't pass it up.
   1095806|00000000||Oh, the excitement! With the three lots behind us, we'll go to an intermission. Amenities abound, please partake. We'll resume shortly.

   1096839|00000000||The white-haired gentleman enters a bid of two hundred! Do we have two fifty?
   1096841|00000000||Two hundred once! Twice! Thri--!
   1096854|00000000||Splendid! Countess Mignole bids two hundred and fifty! Do I hear three hundred?
   1095712|00000000||[Bid.]
   1095705|00000000||Ladies and gentlemen! Lot number one is a brass figurine from the collection of the infamous Count Romilly. Rumor has it the figure harbors a treasure inside. A rumor one may prove or disprove solely by destroying the beautiful bauble itself.
   1096835|00000000||Starting price - quite the bargain at fifty crowns. Any advance?
   1095709|00000000||With Master Hilbert at one hundred!
   1096837|00000000||To Countess Mignole now at one hundred and fifty. Do I hear two hundred? Might I have an advance?
   1095701|00000000||Monster hunting doesn't pay all that well. Think I'll let you wealthy folk play. I'll wait in the back.
   1096780|00000000||Och, Geralt. You and yer saggin' coin pouch. A financial advisor, that's what ye need.
   1096803|00000000||Finances - that's actually what I'm lacking. Don't worry about me, go. I'll see if there's any caviar left.
   1095637|00000000||Nah. I'll wait in the back.
   1095636|00000000||Course I will.
   1095646|00000000||Course I will. Went to the trouble to sneak me in here, I'd be an ass not take a stab.
   1096760|00000000||Hah! I knew the bug'd get ye!
   1103772|00000000||Greetings, ladies, gentlemen, and the rest.
   1103774|00000000||We've an exceptional auction ahead, dear folk.
   1095824|00000000||Och, Geralt, look! Horst Borsodi. Come on afore some other cocksuckers steal him. Just-- Well, don't expect a warm welcome.
   1095826|00000000||Greetin's, Horst! Allow me to introduce a dear friend and associate - Geralt of Rivia, who--
   1097185|00000000||…comes uninvited.
   1095832|00000000||Exactly, pretty serious oversight. I see no reason why the faux pas should taint our new-found acquaintance.
   1097253|00000000||Acquaintance? I honestly don't know what you think this is, vagrant.
   1097240|00000000||Exactly! Serious oversight.
   1095836|00000000||But you've gained by my presence. Dropped a hefty pile of crowns here.
   1095838|00000000||I'm not like Vivaldi. Profit alone only goes so far for me. I seek more. The auction house is primarily a meeting place for the local elite.
   1097251|00000000||I needn't tell you an itinerant mutant doesn't quite fit in.
   1097241|00000000||That may be so, but you gained by my presence.
   1097239|00000000||Forgot my manners.
   1095845|00000000||Forgot my manners. Forgive me. The teachings at Kaer Morhen, well, etiquette wasn't high on the list. Scandalous.
   1095847|00000000||Mhm. That's plain to see.
   1095840|00000000||Eheheh-eh, got the distinct impression the two of youse started off on the wrong foot. Perhaps we should raise a toast to--
   1097281|00000000||What's one like you want from one like me?
   1095878|00000000||From Olgierd von Everec.
   1095888|00000000||From Olgierd von Everec. Name mean anything to you?
   1095890|00000000||It does.
   1095892|00000000||Guards! Escort the witcher out! And he's not to enter, not alone, not hand in hand with Hierarch Hemmelfart!
   1095894|00000000||Honestly, he asked a question, it were a simple inquiry.
   1095896|00000000||One more word and I shall move my accounts to the competition.
   1095898|00000000||Sorry, mate, but…
   1095900|00000000||No reason to trouble the guards, Horst. I'll go willingly.
   1097286|00000000||I don't recall giving you a choice in the matter. Kick his swiving mutated arse out!
   1095880|00000000||Doesn't matter. Willing to tell me what it is, or not?
   1095876|00000000||Doesn't matter.
   1095869|00000000||Right, let's dispense with the niceties. Maximilian Borsodi's House - gotta lay my hands on it, whatever it--
   1095871|00000000||What?! Where did you learn of it?!
   1095873|00000000||Gentlemen! No reason to lose our composure, raise our voices, heh.
   1095875|00000000||I ask you - where did you learn of it?!
   1137555|00000000||Whoa. Come on, now--
   1137557|00000000||Where?!
   1095843|00000000||Need to find Maximilian Borsodi's House.
   1095842|00000000||This isn't working for me. There another Borsodi I could talk to?
   1095851|00000000||The Borsodis' Auction House - I'm assuming the name's no coincidence. Got a relative I could talk to? Someone - how do I say this - a smidgen less irritating?
   1095855|00000000||Haha, ahem. Name's a historical legacy, Geralt. Auction house was founded by two brothers, Horst's father and an uncle. In this generation--
   1097283|00000000||I and only I am it. So get to the point. Now.
   1094341|00000000||Esteemed ladies, gentlemen! Kindly take your places, the auction will begin shortly!
   1094343|00000000||Och! At last. Come to the fore with me. I won't see nowt otherwise.
   1096807|00000000||Och, Geralt. It's nothin' personal, but I've this principle, got to have it. I dinnae extend additional loans to existin' debtors. You still owe me two hundred crowns, remember?
   1096809|00000000||Hm. Yeah, that.
   1096811|00000000||But, ye'll bid anyhow, won't ye? If only for sport?
   1125623|00000000||Hired me to find out what happened to Folkert. Never mentioned murder.
   1125625|00000000||But one will happen, soon. You want naught to do with it, that is your right. But I aim to round up folk who still give a damn.
   1125627|00000000||It's a couple of old folks. Doubt they'll put up a fight.
   1125629|00000000||All the better. Now, I wager you want your coin, eh? Take it. And get out of my sight.
   1125549|00000000||Had an accident.
   1126864|00000000||Ran into trouble, a freak event.
   1126866|00000000||Of what type? Did monsters attack him?
   1126868|00000000||Mhm. Could say that.
   1126840|00000000||Found some witnesses. Claim wolves attacked him. He survived at first, then went back in the woods to harvest more herbs… His luck ran out.
   1126842|00000000||Ah… A treasure, that lad - dutiful, mannered. Such a shame. Well, here's your gold. I trust it will serve you well.
   1125612|00000000||I did.
   1125614|00000000||He's been avenged - there's that. Eh, your coin. Take it and… and now please be on your way. I must write to Folkert's parents.
   1126870|00000000||He was-- Agh, really no gentle way to put this. Cannibals ate him.
   1126872|00000000||Cannibals? A short ride from Novigrad? In Velen, that would be one thing, but… but here? Gods!
   1126875|00000000||You slew them, right? Tell me you killed them!
   1125548|00000000||Cannibals ate him.
   1125543|00000000||Know what happened to Folkert.
   1126836|00000000||Folkert, your apprentice - I know what happened to him.
   1126838|00000000||Out with it! I've gone near daft with worry!
   1094120|00000000||Monster deck, usually.
   1095429|00000000||Frankly, I usually play my monsters.
   1095431|00000000||A witcher who plays monsters? Hm, interesting.
   1094121|00000000||Prefer the Northern Realms.
   1095433|00000000||Not a bad deck, Nilfgaard, but… I'll take the Northern Realms over it any day.
   1095435|00000000||Ah, understood. A patriot!
   1095410|00000000||Scoia'tael - that's what I favor.
   1095580|00000000||Crap guess. Scoia'tael's my favorite.
   1095582|00000000||Right, right. A solid knock to your foe - nothing like it, eh?
   1095513|00000000||So be it.
   1095530|00000000||Well, you did help with the guards at the door… All right. Ten percent of any winnings is yours.
   1095532|00000000||Any chance for fifteen?
   1095534|00000000||Don't push it, Vimme.
   1095537|00000000||All right. Game on.
   1095526|00000000||Awfully resourceful of you, Vimme. I'm impressed. Gotta refuse, all the same. No offence.
   1095528|00000000||Dinnae make a fuss now. I'm a dwarf and a banker, so I've doubly thick skin. Good luck to ye!
   1095512|00000000||No chance.
   1094151|00000000||Hm. Suppose it's not whether you win or lose… Sure, I'm game.
   1094153|00000000||Brilliant! I'll lay my cards out.
   1094155|00000000||Naturally. Geralt… might I have a wee word?
   1095505|00000000||What is it?
   1095507|00000000||Well, mate… seein' as I brought youse together, I do believe I'm owed a share of your winnings, if there are any. Ten percent? A finder's fee o' sorts, ye ken?
   1095509|00000000||Mhm. Pretty clear now why you wanted us to meet.
   1095511|00000000||One cardinal bit I've learnt in my trade, friend - coin dinnae stink. So, what'll it be?
   1094148|00000000||Why not.
   1094157|00000000||Sorry. Another time, maybe.
   1094159|00000000||Hm. It is what it is. I'm off for a nosh. By the by, watch those little black balls. Strange, them.
   1095492|00000000||Agh, to spurn the caviar of the Koviri sturgeon! They're castin' pearls before swine!
   1095494|00000000||Come, Geralt. Let's have a blether with another.
   1094149|00000000||Maybe another time.
   1095488|00000000||Hm. We got a minute afore the auction starts, so… nudge nudge wink wink - maybe a round?
   1094147|00000000||Skinned me of my prime card, he did, imagine that! One you gave me as collateral a time back!
   1094139|00000000||I've heard. Tourney at the Passiflora. Sat in on that, didn't you?
   1094145|00000000||Mhm. Pretty special as events go.
   1095486|00000000||That were nothin'!
   1094129|00000000||You ought to know, Hilbert - Geralt here's a positively superb player. Su-perb!
   1095425|00000000||Seen right through me.
   1095427|00000000||Hah! I knowed it! You don't look like one who easily agrees to a draw.
   1094119|00000000||Seen through me.
   1095413|00000000||Frankly, don't find gwent the least bit interesting.
   1095415|00000000||Oh? Shame, that.
   1095418|00000000||Good to see ye again, Hilbert… Time we were goin'. Listen, if ye decide to buy intae that fund we discussed, ye know where to find me!
   1095421|00000000||You call that interesting?
   1095423|00000000||Bloke's not scintillatin' in conversation, I'll grant ye, but he's a right fiend at the card table. No matter, maybe next time.
   1095411|00000000||Not interested in gwent.
   1093948|00000000||Hilbert! It's been years. Allow me to introduce youse… Geralt of Rivia.
   1093950|00000000||Enchanted.
   1093952|00000000||Pleasure's all mine.
   1093954|00000000||How's it? Got yer eye on any sparkly bits the day?
   1094118|00000000||Not really. I buy what strikes me fancy. I need something right sumptuous for me walls, just now.
   1095405|00000000||Nilfgaard. I get it right?
   1095407|00000000||Excuse me?
   1095409|00000000||Your gwent deck - it's Nilfgaard, innit? Come on, admit it.
   1094196|00000000||Egh, ain't about to play you no more!
   1094161|00000000||Well, what's it you want?
   1094163|00000000||By my reckoning, that Countess Mignole's just a mad old bat!
   1095592|00000000||Speaking of percentages… your share, Vimme.
   1095584|00000000||You're not at all bad. But it ain't enough to outplay me.
   1095586|00000000||That so? How about a rematch?
   1095588|00000000||Apologies, mate, but I only ever play any bloke once. Vah file, as them pointy-ears say.
   1095590|00000000||Aww! Hard luck, Geralt. Yer cards, though - ye find them in the crapper? Didnae line up, did they?
   1094131|00000000||Unbelievable! I don't buy it! You cheated, you must 'ave. Something! Hexed me or whatnot!
   1094133|00000000||Oo, I'd be careful with the gab, Hilbert… Afore Geralt takes a mind to demandin' satisfaction.
   1094135|00000000||Pff! You give it to 'im, you damn midget! You bearded pinchfist!
   1095578|00000000||Oo, interest'll be a right bit higher when that bugger next comes round askin' for a loan.
    458122|3623fdf9||Elite Guard
   1133345|00000000||Merchant
   1135033|00000000||Though Vlodimir had returned to the nether realms, the night was still young and the wedding not yet over. Shani, dejected at the thought that Geralt would soon return to his many pressing concerns, was sitting alone at one of the tables, staring glumly at the crowd of merrymakers. Master Mirror advised Geralt that a bouquet of flowers or some tasty liqueur might cheer her up.<br>
   1135034|00000000||Geralt, remembering Shani's love for rowan blossoms, brought her a branch of them, which she delightedly plaited into her hair. Oh, if you'd only seen her then… She looked lovely, radiant, even.<br>
   1135035|00000000||Geralt decided fortified beverages make the best pick-me-ups, and so brought Shani an ample flask.<br>
   1135041|00000000||The witcher took Shani on a long walk by the river and then… then they got in a boat and, as Geralt told it to me, rowed to the moon. Could my friend be turning into something of a romantic? Or perhaps he always was one? One way or the other, a pleasant afternoon and eventful evening spent together lasted until the break of dawn, during which time they... you'll forgive me if I spare you the details.<br>
   1135042|00000000||The witcher took Shani on a long walk by the river and then… then they got in a boat and, as Geralt told it to me, rowed to the moon. Unfortunately, it seems something about moonlight disagrees with Shani's belly... Or else the poor thing was simply overcome with how romantic it all was. That unfortunate incident aside, both she and Geralt enjoyed the outing, and their pleasant afternoon and eventful evening stretched on until the break of dawn, during which time they... you'll forgive me if I spare you the details.<br>
   1135046|00000000||I don't know if Geralt simply didn't notice Shani's sour mood, or deliberately chose to disregard it, but one way or another he left her to work through it on her own and returned to his own concerns. It is a shame he did so, for something tells me that evening might have had a very moving finale...<br>
   1137570|00000000||Geralt took Shani aside for a long walk by the river – and a heart-to-heart chat. This turn of events was the natural conclusion to a day full of emotions and discoveries – after all that, who wouldn't want to sit down in a quiet spot with an old friend and talk about past times? Shani and Geralt certainly did, and so they talked and laughed until night turned to day, then parted, each returning to his or her own life.<br>
   1137573|00000000||Geralt decided to lift Shani's spirits and, following Master Mirror's advice, brought her some flowers. Shani mocked him a bit, since the blooms he chose were ingredients for a mellowing herbal tea, which doesn't exactly scream "romance," but appreciated the gesture.<br>
   1107525|00000000||Use your Witcher Senses to find something that will cheer Shani up.
   1107526|00000000||Give Shani the present.
   1107527|00000000||Go on a walk with Shani.
   1112675|00000000||Read Shani's Character entry in the Journal to find out what might cheer her up.
   1114616|00000000||Give Shani the alcohol.
   1107524|00000000||A Midnight Clear
   1125534|00000000||What do we have here? Bolt in the back. Went in deep, so a close range shot. Seems it came from the village, or that general direction.
   1125532|00000000||Scar on his forehead. Must be Kluivert.
   1127711|00000000||Bolt in the back. Went in deep, so a close range shot. From the village, or that direction, looks like.
   1125538|00000000||Flaming rose on a red field. Who would've thunk.
   1125540|00000000||Flaming rose on a red field. Knights've found a new pastime.
   1126013|00000000||Stopped here for a second, hid, then ran on.
   1125542|00000000||Hoof prints. Leading towards the hill. Someone's still there.
   1127331|00000000||Tracks lead in that direction…
   1126069|00000000||*Sniff* Smells like… solutions, reagents. Wonder what's cooking.
   1125536|00000000||True as true can be. Dangerous trade, narcotics.
   1126065|00000000||Something bad happened here…
   1126015|00000000||Open window. Boot print on the bed. Somebody was in a hurry.
   1125526|00000000||Crossbow bolt… and footprints - deep. Shooter must've been wearing heavy armor.
   1126067|00000000||Cut down with a sword. Swollen, red nose - snorted any fisstech lately?
   1125530|00000000||Smells of… Huh, they were cooking fisstech. Took most of the equipment. Only left what was broken.
   1125524|00000000||Footprints… uneven. Someone ran through here.
   1136488|fa16e0e2||Professor Shakeslock
   1111356|00000000||What're they doing?
   1111476|00000000||Playin'. Overgrown weans, you see…
   1111478|00000000||Have you any children, Geralt?
   1111480|00000000||None.
   1111482|00000000||Oh yes. Forgot witchers're sterile. Well, don't just stare at me - tell me what brings you.
   1111359|00000000||Need to chat.
   1111407|00000000||I'm all ears, witcher.
   1106954|00000000||Interesting, the company you keep.
   1111409|00000000||Your band - chosen some interesting specimens.
   1111411|00000000||Interestin'? How so? Common carousers and roughnecks, every last one.
   1111462|00000000||Where'd you dig them up?
   1111464|00000000||Some have been with me ages, others I gathered on the road. And a few found me themselves.
   1111466|00000000||They're company for drink and sport, at least. And ever since I began traveling with them, my old enemies have sat quiet as moles.
   1128820|00000000||Nice saber.
   1128869|00000000||First time I've seen a saber like that. What's its origin?
   1128871|00000000||Ofier. It was a… gift.
   1128873|00000000||Any soft-armed craven can hang a blade from his belt, prance about feignin' danger.
   1128875|00000000||But my saber's a promise - if I reach for it, heads will roll. Mere sight of it quells the urge to duel in shavers eager to face Olgierd von Everec, the infamous outlaw.
   1128877|00000000||My medallion seems to think it's magic.
   1128879|00000000||Heh. It thinks, eh? And I think you've never seen a better weapon.
   1128821|00000000||You and Ofier - curious about the king there.
   1129068|00000000||Tell me, how'd you meet the Ofieri you turned into a beast?
   1129100|00000000||Aren't you a nosy one.
   1129102|00000000||What's it matter? You like to talk about yourself.
   1129104|00000000||That I cannot deny. Ofieri was a dauphin on a voyage through lands unknown to learn of their cultures and customs.
   1129106|00000000||He fell for a lass. As it happened, this woman was already important to me. But at the time I was nowt compared to a noble from a foreign land. So her parents promised her hand to the Ofieri, though she loved me.
   1129108|00000000||If you'd only seen his feeble attempts at charm. When she asked why he traveled disguised as a common merchant, he said he was like the frog from the fairytale - one kiss from her and he'd turn into a prince.
   1129110|00000000||Wanted to be a frog? Became a frog.
   1136545|00000000||If you fulfill wishes as well as you play gwent, I venture I've naught to fear.
   1137394|00000000||We'll have to play again.
   1136543|00000000||Shite. Not much I detest more than losin'.
   1137389|00000000||Well, my congratulations. This card's yours.
   1137392|00000000||Thanks.
   1127988|00000000||Now, ready to listen, or do you still not give two shites about what I've got to say?
   1127990|00000000||I'm ready! I'm listening!
   1127992|00000000||Good. You'll return to your lord and tell him as follows.
   1127994|00000000||His demand was brazen, hurt me to the core. For I was brought up to respect the sacred law of hospitality. And I shall not bend to an uncouth boor's dictum. Understood?
   1127996|00000000||I will pay him a visit shortly to test his willingness to adapt. So you ride off and announce me, and don't spare your horse. Got it?
   1127998|00000000||Aye… Got it.
   1128000|00000000||Give this man a mount and leave him go!
   1128003|00000000||Come, witcher. We must talk outside.
   1128034|00000000||Come on, none of this dallyin'.
   1128036|00000000||Ohh….
   1106965|00000000||Third wish - time you stated it.
   1106967|00000000||A moment, Geralt. I must see to somethin', then we'll chat.
   1106969|00000000||You, there! Yank the herrin' out o' the barrel!
   1106963|00000000||Third task - tell me about it.
   1111424|00000000||Got something for you.
   1111426|00000000||I love gifts, but I prefer to unwrap them in private.
   1111428|00000000||Oi, lads! Mind the barrels! Goin' out for a jabber with Geralt!
   1111430|00000000||Come.
   1111405|00000000||Got Borsodi's house for you.
   1111433|00000000||Vlodimir sends his love.
   1111435|00000000||You spoke to him? Impossible.
   1111437|00000000||Did more'n that. Fulfilled your wish. And talked to him extensively. Curious what he had to say?
   1111406|00000000||Vlodimir sends his greetings.
   1136548|00000000||Hm. You ever play gwent?
   1137381|00000000||An immortal demands you fulfill three wishes, and you've the gall to propose a round of gwent?
   1137383|00000000||Afraid to lose? No problem. I'll find someone else.
   1137385|00000000||Believe that's the worst wind-up I've ever heard. Lay out your cards.
   1136707|00000000||So, care for a round of gwent?
   1137387|00000000||Why not.
   1136546|00000000||Let's play gwent.
   1106960|00000000||So long.
   1106955|00000000||Farewell.
   1128880|00000000||How'd that Ofieri prince turn into a monster?
   1129005|00000000||Keep wondering how you turned the Ofieri into a beast. More I think about it, more I'm sure it was no run-of-the-mill curse.
   1129070|00000000||This professional curiosity, or nosiness as common as the clap?
   1129072|00000000||Desire to improve. Information could prove useful down the line.
   1129007|00000000||In the future? You under the delusion you'll complete your tasks, live happily ever after?
   1129009|00000000||Remains to be seen. So for now, admit it - a mage helped you, right?
   1129013|00000000||Give you a hint - you're not the only one to fulfill wishes around here.
   1129015|00000000||O'Dimm transformed the Ofieri? It was your wish?
   1129017|00000000||Nay, it was my doin' alone. But you're right, it was no ordinary curse, though I'll say no more. A curse I uttered in a moment of rage, with no thought to it actually takin' hold.
   1128112|00000000||How much for a herring?
   1128236|00000000||Crown apiece.
   1128238|00000000||Huh. I'll wait for it to drop.
   1128109|00000000||What's all this kickin'?
   1128165|00000000||Herrin's gotta turn and mix from time to time!
   1128104|00000000||Empty herring barrel. Stinks of fish. Hm.
   1129836|00000000||Hm. Tidy. And everything's clean, ready for a meal to be served.
   1133927|00000000||Caretaker must still set the table.
   1108427|00000000||Hm. Seems I can't pass back through.
   1123586|00000000||Ugh… Hope I'm near the bedchamber.
   1108518|00000000||Hm. Someone out to stop me?
   1108013|00000000||Hm, fire damage. Interesting.
   1111260|00000000||Guess thieves tried to lower the statue with ropes, but something scared them off.
   1111249|00000000||Don't know this deity. Strange, Olgierd doesn't seem the pious type.
   1108009|00000000||Someone's still tending to the flowerbeds. No violet rose, though.
   1108011|00000000||What the hell was that?
   1108015|00000000||Must've been the way down to the cellar.
   1107976|00000000||Water's ice-cold. Mountain stream cold.
   1126335|00000000||Dammit.
   1111568|00000000||Sketchbook's signed "Iris."
   1111564|00000000||A hairbrush. Floral ornamentation. Pretty.
   1118946|00000000||Beehives. Well-maintained but dormant.
   1107972|00000000||Rather worn… Used often. Wonder by who.
   1111566|00000000||Lovely couple.
   1111284|00000000||Bench was wiped clean recently. So was the floor.
   1107974|00000000||Wood's rotted, completely.
   1127613|00000000||Mighty rusty and covered in creepers.
   1128639|00000000||Need another way in.
   1085583|22a322e4||Cat
   1111494|00000000||A busted lamp… and the ground's trampled.
   1111491|00000000||Somebody dragged something this way… a body?
   1111488|00000000||Damn. Locked.
   1131079|00000000||I'd scooch along, kitty. This place--
   1115918|00000000||What's that? That… digging?

   1105807|00000000||With two wishes down and one more to go, Geralt reported back to Olgierd. There he received his third and final task, which, following in the vein of the its predecessors, seemed nigh unto impossible to complete. Olgierd wanted Geralt to find and bring him the violet rose he had given his wife the last time he saw her. As this was many years ago, and flowers are not noted for their longevity, the rose had certainly disintegrated by now. Yet since Geralt had grown used to finding the unfindable and doing the undoable, he nevertheless set out to try to recover this flower of yesteryear.<br>
   1105809|00000000||Olgierd's abandoned residence was haunted by the ghost of his wife, Iris von Everec – or more accurately, by deadly spectral emanations coming from her dormant spirit. Geralt had to overcome many obstacles before finally awakening Iris' ghost from her tortured sleep so he could talk to her about the violet rose. After he did so, he traveled to the world of the ghost's imagination to revive memories repressed within it and defeat the embodiments of Iris' fears. In short, it was one of Geralt's more unusual adventures. At its end, our hero emerged from the imagined world with a very tangible rose in hand, ready to deliver to Olgierd in completion of his wish. The price of obtaining this rose? The ultimate end of Iris von Everec.<br>

At its end, our hero emerged from the imagined world not with the rose itself, but with a very faithful likeness of it painted by Iris von Everec herself. In this way he fulfilled the letter of Olgierd's wish – the rose had been delivered, though in painted form, and with the eyes of Iris von Everec staring out of its canvas.<br>

   1110095|00000000||I found your fire belcher, yet I fear he proved a common coward.
   1110885|00000000||What's his bravery to me? I paid him to eat fire, he need do just that.
   1110887|00000000||Sadly, he's not only a coward, but a cheat as well. Soon as I found him, he lifted his skirt and ran.
   1110097|00000000||And I went to such expense… What's with Daemon?
   1095006|00000000||The missing fire blower is missing no more.
   1101928|00000000||It was my doing, if I may say so myself.
   1110889|00000000||And Daemon? What's with him?
   1110891|00000000||Haven't a clue. He'd chased the fire eater up a tree, so I chased him off. Assumed he'd wandered home.
   1095008|00000000||He hasn't. No one's seen hide nor hair of him.
   1101930|00000000||Then he's a shite poor excuse for a dog!
   1101932|00000000||Aye, true. Never did like the little fleabag.
   1112979|00000000||The dog's small beer - no fire eating, that's the grief.
   1112981|00000000||Aye, grief, no show, oh no… What can we do?
   1117489|00000000||Come now, stiff upper lip. A silly sconce swiller no wedding makes nor breaks.
   1117491|00000000||Silly to you, but it means prestige to us. We aimed to show we're to be taken seriously, that we're more'n just milkers and ploughers and goatherds.
   1117493|00000000||A torch tonguer would change nothing. No circus performer could possibly turn a peasant into a noble.
   1117495|00000000||You think us bumpkins?
   1117497|00000000||Never uttered the word. Yet you are not of the gentry - a simple fact.
   1117499|00000000||Let's go, dumplin'. We're clearly not fit company for our dear lord witcher.
   1117474|00000000||Stop your blubbering. Stiff upper lip.
   1117501|00000000||Hm. I can't help but wonder - must it be a fire eater who performs? What if, instead, there was - oh, I don't know - a juggler?
   1117503|00000000||Just where would we find a juggler at this hour?
   1117505|00000000||But say you did, would that do as a replacement for the fire sniffler?
   1117507|00000000||Well… I suppose it might.
   1117509|00000000||Then I shall perform!
   1117511|00000000||You? First I've heard of a juggling witcher!
   1117513|00000000||Today I'm no ordinary witcher. In my youth I had a great many friends among circus folk. They taught me well.
   1117515|00000000||I shall gladly save you from your troubles, now.
   1117517|00000000||If that's the case, I'll announce the performance!
   1117475|00000000||Perhaps I can be of service?
   1117473|00000000||Lovely wedding, even without the fire drunk.
   1117477|00000000||I regret the loss as well. But there, there, you've put on a lovely wedding even without him!
   1117479|00000000||You think so? Truly?
   1117481|00000000||Wholly! I haven't reveled so thoroughly in ages! You've nothing to be ashamed of. There are vittles, musicians, and all enjoy themselves - as should you.
   1117483|00000000||You marry your daughter off today. Be glad, for sadness can only bring her worry.
   1117485|00000000||Witcher speaks wise words, my dear. Come, let's see to the guests.
   1117487|00000000||Yes, let's. Thank you, witcher, for your trouble. And your kind words.
   1118981|00000000||It'll be midnight soon. The capping will begin.
   1118983|00000000||Then tally-ho to the barn. I must cap my night off with a last hurrah.
   1118985|00000000||Just… easy with the comments, all right? Please?
   1095026|00000000||Your attention, please! I invite all to witness a spectacle unrivaled, a man so bold as to eat fire!
   1095028|00000000||We must watch the trickery. Never saw anything like it while alive.
   1110893|00000000||He failed to return?
   1095010|00000000||No, he did. He's just acting mighty strange.
   1095012|00000000||Seems to be in a muddle o' sorts. Got as much life in him as a carrot.
   1101934|00000000||Might've eaten some nightshade or whatnot.
   1110138|00000000||I found your fire licker, but he gave up the ghost on the way back. Too much vodka.
   1110140|00000000||Just my luck to hire a drunk… And Daemon? What's with him?
   1110446|00000000||Told you we'd 'ave done better to spend the coin on a stove fitter than a fire eater. Our hearth's near shot.
   1095031|00000000||Hm. Truth be told, I'd hoped a fire eater would've done somethin' more… riveting.
   1110444|00000000||Last time I've paid a penny to any such parasite.
   1095032|00000000||For the coin he took, he should've ridden in on a fire-breathing dragon.
   1116596|002e393e||Boar
   1124943|00000000||Trail's gone cold… Need to look around. Ask. Maybe someone's seen him.
   1127264|00000000||Brought you more coin. Put it towards better equipment?
   1127266|00000000||Thanks in the thousands! Too kind you are to me, truly.
   1130148|00000000||Your work's worth the coin.
   1130150|00000000||Painite crystal I shall need also.
   1130152|00000000||Huh?
   1130154|00000000||Painite, a mineral. In my lands quite rare, here impossible surely to find. Lenses I make from it, the powder residue I blend into my mixtures.
   1127626|00000000||See what I can do.
   1127219|00000000||Got the funds for advanced tools.
   1127273|00000000||Made good use of my coin by the look of things.
   1127275|00000000||The return to my craft - know you not the pleasure it brings. I thank you!
   1127277|00000000||Don't mention it. How's the work going?
   1127279|00000000||Several lesser runes I've forged already - practice, you see. Heheh. Yet I sadden in thinking the tools and ingredients I possess are not fit to create better.
   1137374|00000000||Got lucky - found you some jade. Here.
   1137376|00000000||Thank you, I do. If you to gaze wish at my handiwork, to do so I invite you.

   1115048|00000000||Like this?
   1115050|00000000||You were meant to smile, not bare your teeth.
   1115054|00000000||No, still wrong. Smile like you did when Papa agreed we could marry. Please?
   1115056|00000000||Hm?
   1115406|00000000||You're useless. I can tell something's bothering you.
   1119394|00000000||I've a bit of work I should see to.
   1119396|00000000||Again? Olgierd… we agreed not to keep any secrets from one another. We promised.
   1119398|00000000||Forgive me. I don't wish to discuss this.

   1131313|00000000||Fits, I think…
   1131302|00000000||[Grapes on the left.]
   1131321|00000000||Let's try this…
   1131304|00000000||[Grapes on the right.]
   1131305|00000000||[Back.]
   1131303|00000000||[Grapes in the middle.]
   1131315|00000000||Maybe here?
   1128602|00000000||[Choose a place for the grapes.]
   1131275|00000000||[Leave.]
   1128601|00000000||[Choose a place for the apple.]
   1131294|00000000||[Apple on the left.]
   1131307|00000000||Let's try this…
   1131295|00000000||[Apple in the middle.]
   1131309|00000000||Hmm…
   1131297|00000000||[Back.]
   1115880|00000000||Hm. Pretty in the summer, the von Everecs' manor.
   1115874|00000000||A portrait of the married couple.
   1122664|00000000||Another blurred memory.
   1115882|00000000||Home-made paints. Strange… can still smell the turpentine.
   1128525|00000000||Fresh… as if someone just rinsed it.
   1128527|00000000||Hm. Still not right…
   1128579|00000000||She painted Olgierd… but the details are off. Living tableau's missing something…
   1131338|00000000||Dammit… Gotta go around.
   1133374|00000000||Goblet - like the one in the painting.
   1134319|00000000||Towel should hang here.
   1134321|00000000||Towel should lie here.
   1137096|00000000||Geralt was racking his brains for a way to defeat Master Mirror when Shani came to his rescue. She knew of a professor from the Oxenfurt Academy who had spent years scrutinizing every manifestation of black magic and surely would be able to help. Unfortunately, the witch hunters had decided the professor's knowledge was best used for their goals and their goals only and had placed guards outside his home. Officially he was a free man, but in reality, no one entered or left the house without their permission.<br>
   1137097|00000000||The professor told Geralt of the long hours he had spent scouring old tomes for accounts of Gaunter O'Dimm, alias Master Mirror. He had been set on this trail by Olgierd von Everec, who paid him handsomely for his labors. This research had borne fruit in the form of a great many secrets about the mysterious O'Dimm, including a possible way to outsmart him. Sadly, however, the professor did not live to see if this trick would work for Geralt in practice, for during their conversation Shakeslock made one step outside the runic circle drawn on the floor of his residence and died immediately. We will never know if this step was accidental or deliberate – by the time Geralt met him, he had become a tired and tormented wreck who just might have considered death a relief.
   1137095|00000000||Professor Shakeslock
   1018000|e223a10b||Hunter
   1140438|00000000||Doppler
   1098552|00000000||…And might ye, miss, be 'midst the unattached? I am… though only a wee spell now.
   1099392|00000000||Is that so? Impossible! Only a fool would loosen their hold on a mate like you.
   1098537|00000000||And Countess Yvonne of Lan Exeter's necklace. Your handiwork, wasn't it?
   1099387|00000000||It was. I scaled a gutter, entered her bedchamber.
   1099389|00000000||Hah! I knew it! I knew it.
   1098554|00000000||Ah, at last. We're all here. Time to begin.
   1099394|00000000||This heist, it's no jest. So if any of you has any doubts, isn't sure, now's the time to leave. Won't be able to after.
   1099397|00000000||The Borsodis' Auction House, its vault - that's our target. Eveline, you'll enter through the tower when the patrol rounds this corner. Drop us a line. We have to be inside within five minutes. Is that enough?
   1099399|00000000||It's plenty.
   1099401|00000000||Splendid. Once we're all in the tower, we'll proceed to the auction house. Shouldn't see any guards inside. If we do, we'll have Geralt and his blades.
   1098556|00000000||Then downstairs to the vault. Quinto will crack the lock. We get in the vault, take the loot, disappear out the back through a secret passage.
   1098602|00000000||What about wearin' masks? Not a city in the North that don't have wanted posters with my likeness hangin' about.
   1115209|00000000||If you're so damned scared somebody'll talk, let's all go there together. Now.
   1115371|00000000||Any objections? Anyone need more time?
   1115374|00000000||On our way, then.
   1115206|00000000||I say we go there together. Now.
   1115211|00000000||Huh, sure know how to motivate a crew. No matter. See you there.
   1115207|00000000||Meet you all there.
   1109859|00000000||Ah, one last thing.
   1099489|00000000||Inform the City Watch, blabber anythin' about this over an ale, and I'll kill you. With me own hands.
   1126071|00000000||Geralt, I see, has come prepared.
   1126075|00000000||Think it's a fetish of sorts?
   1126137|00000000||And I will bring masks for the rest.
   1098609|00000000||I'll tend to that.
   1098604|00000000||What about masks? Got a rather recognizable mug myself.
   1098591|00000000||All right. Let's get to work. Wanna be done with this soon as possible.
   1098600|00000000||We'll reconvene in the gateway beside the tower. Midnight sharp. And everyone's to make sure they're not followed. I'll get word to the cook in the barracks.
   1098564|00000000||Let's get to work.
   1099447|00000000||What about the vault? How is it secured?
   1099466|00000000||With a door. But you ought to be able to handle it. Any other problems we resolve as they come.
   1099472|00000000||Anything else?
   1099468|00000000||And the vault? Is it secured somehow?
   1099470|00000000||Even if it is, my blend of saltpeter, cordite and fulminatin' silver'll do the trick.
   1098582|00000000||Additional security measures, traps - any inside? Anything we need to watch out for?
   1098584|00000000||Nothing particularly dangerous. Here, on the ground floor, there's a rope linked to the bell in the tower. Anyone sounds the alarm, there'll be trouble.
   1099427|00000000||How do we stop it from ringing?
   1099429|00000000||Don't pull the rope. As I said, the auction house ought to be empty. I don't expect any problems.
   1098566|00000000||Any security measures inside?
   1100903|00000000||But if you were to--
   1100905|00000000||Find that location, I wouldn't need any of you. Believe you me, I've tried. Time and again.
   1100908|00000000||Anythin' else?
   1100901|00000000||Aye, but you could--
   1100895|00000000||Got a horse sense take on this. Secret passage - if we plan to use it on the way out, why not on the way in?
   1100897|00000000||Excellent question. Why not?
   1100899|00000000||Every corridor has two ends, right? Like a rope. I know the location of just one end. It's in the vault. The other, it's somewhere beneath the city. But I can't tell you where.
   1107038|00000000||Mhm. Great.
   1100893|00000000||Secret passage… why not get in that way? Seems dumb not to.
   1098565|00000000||No plan B? If something goes seriously wrong?
   1098568|00000000||Hm. All good and fine, except… what if something goes wrong? Seriously.
   1098570|00000000||You're on your own. We all are.
   1099425|00000000||Just like that?
   1099487|00000000||No room for friendship in this business.
   1099420|00000000||I've said my piece. Any questions?
   1098558|00000000||Then downstairs to the vault. Casimir blows the vault door. We go in, take the loot, disappear out the back through a secret passage.
   1137825|00000000||Why'd they send you down here? Only if it's not confidential, of course.
   1096847|00000000||I need a venom sample - from the beast that prowls these sewers.
   1097255|00000000||It doesn't just kill those who come down here, you know. The water in so many wells is contaminated. Folk're getting ill, Redanian soldiers among them.
   1097257|00000000||Plan to kill the beast. Bring you a sample of its venom after I do.
   1097258|00000000||Nice of you to offer, but I'd rather go with you, collect the sample myself.
   1097260|00000000||Creature's dangerous - you saw what it can do.
   1097262|00000000||I'm a big girl, Geralt. I can take care of myself. And you know I'll get my way, so don't try to talk me out of anything.
   1097265|00000000||Eh, fine, your choice. So show me where the monster attacked you.
   1097296|00000000||This way.
   1097166|00000000||Your mission - what was it?
   1097267|00000000||What attacked you? Get a good look at it?
   1097269|00000000||No. I started running as soon as it appeared. It was huge, spat venom and… made these… slurping sounds. That's all I know.
   1097271|00000000||Hm. Doesn't sound like a major necrophage or a pack of drowners…
   1097273|00000000||No, this was one "thing" - big, but one. Somebody threw a torch at it. Monster couldn't have cared less.
   1097275|00000000||All right, not afraid of fire. Good to know.
   1097263|00000000||His injuries - how'd he get them?
   1097167|00000000||He someone important to you?
   1097243|00000000||The soldier… he someone important to you?
   1097245|00000000||His name was Nols. Supposed to go on leave next week. Now he won't - nor will the rest of his unit.
   1097247|00000000||How many were they?
   1097249|00000000||A whole squad, six brave boys. All dead.
   1104957|00000000||Oh no you don't! Hear me? Don't you dare!
   1104959|00000000||Please don't do this to me.
   1104962|00000000||Shani?
   1104965|00000000||Geralt?
   1104967|00000000||What're you doing here?
   1104970|00000000||Trying to save his life! Help me!
   1110759|00000000||Shani, calm down. He's dead.
   1110761|00000000||I'm sure… something… can be done…
   1110763|00000000||Let it go.
   1104973|00000000||Dammit! All for nothing!
   1104976|00000000||You did all you could.
   1104983|00000000||Thanks, Geralt.
   1104985|00000000||It's, uh, good to see you.
   1097161|00000000||You, too. Lost track of you after I left Vizima. Where'd you go? What've you been doing?
   1097163|00000000||Um, long story short? I've been treating the sick and wounded, as always. Mainly at my clinic in Oxenfurt. But in Redania I'm called on to help the army at times, as well.
   1106705|00000000||I'll want to hear the long story long, too.
   1097165|00000000||Sure, but, uh, once we're out of these sewers.
   1093119|00000000||Redanian army force you to come here, too? Or you just down here for a pleasant stroll?
   1137823|00000000||Got our orders this morning. I came down here with a whole unit, but… something attacked us.
   1115890|00000000||Death! Death to you!
   1115892|00000000||You'll die here, vagrant!
   1127340|00000000||Welcome, welcome! What would you say to a hand or two of gwent?
   1127342|00000000||Uhh… not gonna try to sell me something first?
   1127344|00000000||My goods are not swallows, they will not flit nor flee.
   1128190|00000000||Cards won't, either.
   1128192|00000000||Do you wish to split hairs all day, or play gwent? Hm?
   1127356|00000000||Like to take a look at your wares.
   1127358|00000000||Like to take a look at your wares.
   1127326|00000000||Like to buy something.
   1127364|00000000||So, should we lay 'em down?
   1127366|00000000||Yes, yes, yes! You needn't ask twice!
   1127327|00000000||Sure, gwent it is.
   1127360|00000000||Should be going…
   1127362|00000000||If ever you need a partner for gwent… you know where to find me!
   1127329|00000000||See you.
   1127328|00000000||Quite the card lover, aren't you?
   1127348|00000000||Feels like you might've missed your calling.
   1127350|00000000||Oh? Curious conclusion. Why?
   1127352|00000000||Well, should be hawking goods. Instead, gwent's all you talk about.
   1127354|00000000||Hmmm… You're right! So, care for a match?
   1127346|00000000||Well, then? Shall we lay down some gwent?
   1115924|00000000||Fool!
   1115926|00000000||Die…
   1112957|00000000||Lebioda's wounds!
   1112961|00000000||Oh, whoreson!
   1112963|00000000||C'mon! Get 'im!
   1112959|00000000||Own mam won't know you once we're done!
   1112965|00000000||What the devil was that?!
   1112969|00000000||I beat up the doctor, I shat on the mountain, I spit on the children, I pissed in the fountain…
   1112967|00000000||Uh-huh?
   1126495|00000000||Phew… A taker, at long last! Poverty on everyone's lips, but when you've a job to give, no one's eager! Folk're lazy, that's the truth of it!
   1126497|00000000||Stick to the point. If you don't mind.
   1126499|00000000||Right, right… Sorry for the chatter. I'm anxious, is all. Been so long without any word… ehh.
   1126501|00000000||It's my apprentice, Folkert. I sent him to the Deadwight Wood - you know, the forest near Martin Feuille's farmstead. I'd run out of han fiber, see, and the damned stuff grows thick as weeds there…
   1126503|00000000||Lemme guess - hasn't returned.
   1126505|00000000||Yes-- No-- He hasn't. Please, find him. And bring him back, safe and sound.
   1124887|00000000||No promises… but I can certainly look for him. Any distinguishing features? How will I recognize him?
   1126528|00000000||Hrm, got to think on that… Well, he's a halfling, as I am. Light hair… Will that do?
   1126530|00000000||It'll have to. So long.
   1124878|00000000||Fine. I'll look for him.
   1124885|00000000||Sorry… No time for this now. Things change, I'll come see you again.
   1124879|00000000||Sorry, don't have time for this now.
   1124881|00000000||So? What'll it be, eh? Will you look for Folkert or not?
   1124877|00000000||Here about the notice.
   1126491|00000000||Here about the contract.
   1135310|00000000||Unfortunate accidents happen to even the most gods-fearing of men. This realization came to Geralt when he happened across the corpse of a priest. On the body he found a journal, and, after a moment of silence for the deceased's memory, he tucked the document into his satchel.<br>
   1135311|00000000||From the notes he learned locals were having a bit of trouble in the form of a haunted cemetery. Led by a sense of duty, Geralt decided to see what was disturbing the dead's peace and endangering the living's lives.<br>
   1135312|00000000||It turned out the crypt was haunted by a powerful ghost, an Accursed Mother. The wraith jealously guarded the treasures laid to rest with the dead and attacked all intruders. This time, however, she had met her match.
   1135313|00000000||Search the crypt's underground passages.
   1135314|00000000||Read the priest's notes.
   1136507|00000000||The Cursed Chapel
   1125513|00000000||She's dead. Grew weak, weaker, then - pfft! - like a spark. Devils take your soul.
   1127450|00000000||It is, to see you again, quite the pleasure.
   1114435|00000000||You're a long way from Ofier.
   1127601|00000000||A long way and with dangers fraught. But in our homeland they say, "In risk there is honor."
   1127603|00000000||Got a ring to it. Not true in my experience, though. Face plenty of risks. Honor - not so much.
   1127605|00000000||Because risk issues from intent - important is this intent! The long passage I braved to admire the unknown and bring glory to myself and my liege.
   1127607|00000000||The world we must explore, virgin lands discover, new knowledge garner among our brothers then to spread. For is there in life a beauty greater than to admire the new, to stand in awe of the never-ending creation of the world?
   1127609|00000000||That mean I've landed in a camp of explorers and philosophers?
   1127611|00000000||Indeed. Your customs we come to observe, knowledge to exchange, and goods, naturally, to trade.
   1127769|00000000||Willing to tell me about your homeland?
   1127771|00000000||Your homeland - be glad to hear some tales about it if you've got the time.
   1127773|00000000||If time you have. For of my home I could speak until your ears withered and your legs failed you.
   1127775|00000000||What here they call Ofier in truth is many diverse polities and peoples.
   1127777|00000000||A land it is of vast steppes, mountains forbidding, lakes clear as crystal and wild lands untouched.
   1127779|00000000||A land of fallen empires, kingdoms at their peak and tribes that know no monarchs yet remember in myth a time when the world was young.
   1127781|00000000||You call any of these lands home?
   1127783|00000000||Yes, a town with towers to make Nilfgaard weep with envy. Of philosophers, doctors, mathematicians and mages an enclave. But about these last you should my friend interrogate, for one among them is he - a runewright.
   1127785|00000000||I'll make it a point to talk to him.
   1128059|00000000||Fine horse you've got.
   1128061|00000000||Quite the mount you've got.
   1128063|00000000||Ah yes, a loyal friend I have in Babiyetza. And she is wiser than many a man.
   1128065|00000000||Countless races we have won together.
   1128067|00000000||So, an explorer and a jockey in one.
   1128069|00000000||From where I come, small children ride, and not a gathering is by a horse race not crowned.
   1134900|00000000||Wouldn't mind a look at your wares.
   1127465|00000000||What'd you bring from Ofier? Mind if I have a look?
   1128926|00000000||Our craftsmen's goods, you see worth in them?
   1128928|00000000||Quite a bit, I'd say.
   1128930|00000000||Ah, these are nothing compared to what I could offer had I not lost my prized diagrams.
   1128932|00000000||How'd you lose them?
   1128934|00000000||To thieves. In our travels, I and my companions surprise attacked by local ruffians were. The diagrams, their loss, I bemoan not so much as I do one of my comrades, killed in the violence.
   1128936|00000000||Sounds like a real loss. Sorry.
   1128938|00000000||I might have been more cautious. Should you encounter the diagrams, return them, and thankful I shall be.
   1128940|00000000||Duplicates I will make, with markings your craftsmen understand. A gift for you.
   1128942|00000000||I'll keep that in mind.
   1128924|00000000||Shame. Unfortunately, can't really look into this now.
   1128923|00000000||These diagrams - might be able to recover them for you.
   1128912|00000000||See if I can't find your diagrams, recover them for you.
   1128916|00000000||These instructions when followed produce items worthy of a king.
   1128918|00000000||Tell me where you were attacked. Remember?
   1128920|00000000||A crossroads, not far. Forgive me, for this area I know poorly. Detailed directions I cannot provide. North of the spot stood a residence, a near ruin.
   1128922|00000000||Should be able to find it.
   1114442|00000000||You won, congratulations. And you were right all along - Ofieri mares are swift as the wind.
   1114444|00000000||Ofieri mares may be swift as the wind, not quite as fast as my Roach, though.
   1127692|00000000||I congratulate you! A saddle for your mount your reward, our contest to commemorate. It will make you a rider even swifter.
   1128049|00000000||Thanks. Like your new gear, Roach?
   1128051|00000000||Hah! Much may be said of a man by how he treats his horse.
   1127645|00000000||Our myths tell of a time when love brought together the skies and the steppe. And from their union was born the first mare.
   1127647|00000000||Weak were the creatures called men, they fell prey to countless dangers. The mare nursed them, her milk fed them. Strong they grew, and she let them saddle her. Warriors they became and gave fight to their foes.
   1128453|00000000||The myths teach us to respect our horses, noblest among all beasts.
   1127649|00000000||Beautiful story. Thanks… for that and the race.
   1127622|00000000||Heard a lot of good things about Ofieri mares, their speed. Care to race?
   1127624|00000000||Hmhmha. Swift as the western winds are our mounts. To prove this would be an honor. So race we must!
   1127738|00000000||Care to race again?
   1127740|00000000||A pure pleasure it would be!
   1114438|00000000||Up for a horse race?
   1114440|00000000||Farewell.
   1127452|00000000||Take care, now.
   1127620|00000000||Go and in the world glory. Its never-ending creation be praised. Farewell.
   1128914|00000000||All four recover and a reward shall be yours. Duplicates I will make, with markings your craftsmen understand.
   1118605|00000000||Dammit! Stupid bugs.
   1117149|00000000||Don't like this place.
   1117151|00000000||Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
   1118008|00000000||Painting's destroyed.
   1118003|00000000||The parlor.
   1118004|00000000||Well, well… did not live in poverty, those two.
   1122478|00000000||What now?
   1128645|00000000||Come inside.
   1128647|00000000||You'll find more memories in there.
   1122480|00000000||Then he went upstairs.
   1128649|00000000||So let's follow him.
   1122482|00000000||He lied.
   1128651|00000000||Didn't want to involve her in this.
   1128653|00000000||He deceived her. And himself.
   1128655|00000000||Oh, never mind. Let's go to the study.
   1101843|00000000||To sink the Borsodis, naturally.
   1101850|00000000||You see, I learned of an interesting clause in old man Maximilian's will.
   1101852|00000000||It states that his sons must meet and shake hands in agreement at least once a year at Belleteyn. Failing that, the auction house must be auctioned off. The proceeds to go to Vilmerius Hospital.
   1101854|00000000||Guess the old man sensed what might happen.
   1137877|00000000||Ah, that's better. All right, what do you have for me?
   1101155|00000000||Max Borsodi's House. As requested.
   1101580|00000000||Dying to hear.
   1101588|00000000||No, dying to hear, though. Always liked a tale with a thrill.
   1101591|00000000||I'm in no mood for jests.
   1101593|00000000||Neither am I. Did my job, Olgierd. Delivered what you asked for. To the letter. Unhappy? Hell, should've chosen your words more carefully.
   1101630|00000000||His brother Ewald was worse.
   1101632|00000000||Was?
   1101634|00000000||Horst killed him. With his own hands.
   1107071|00000000||Horst's brother - did you know about him?
   1107073|00000000||I should think so. Ewald was famous in certain circles.
   1107075|00000000||Which ones?
   1107083|00000000||The kind noble witchers don't usually associate with.
   1107086|00000000||He murdered for coin. No questions. Without batting an eye. Always extravagantly, though. If not for his damned surname, I believe I'd have invited him to join the company.
   1107066|00000000||Did you know Horst had a brother?
   1101832|00000000||The Borsodis - what's your gripe?
   1102019|00000000||Pretty sad story.
   1102022|00000000||Sad story.
   1102024|00000000||Isn't it? Truthfully, I'm surprised I retained any cheer in my soul.
   1102020|00000000||Finish up.
   1102026|00000000||Summing up, you went broke, your woman dumped you, then you got drunk and did something stupid. Heard it all before.
   1102028|00000000||Hahaha! And folk say I've a heart of stone…
   1123146|00000000||Well? Why do you stand there? Do you need something still?
   1101974|00000000||Well? Why do you stand there? Do you need something still?
   1101965|00000000||You need something?
   1101967|00000000||Nothing more, don't think. I'm off to entertain your brother.
   1101969|00000000||Break a leg. Literally.
   1102009|00000000||What happened then?
   1102011|00000000||Argh, what happened then, witcher, was one big stinkin' pile of shite.
   1102007|00000000||What happened then?
   1101977|00000000||Wouldn't have asked if I wasn't.
   1101979|00000000||Hah! Cheeky as ever.
   1101982|00000000||My family, they took on some debt. A poor investment in a sawmill, a bad crop one year, a lawsuit lost. You know how it is - when it rains, it pours.
   1101996|00000000||We needed but a few weeks to recover, but Horst Borsodi had acquired our debt. All of it. Demanded it be repaid immediately.
   1101998|00000000||I pleaded, I begged, I tore open my shirt at his threshold. Agh, it was like talking to a wall.
   1102000|00000000||I went to the auction. Saw those perfumed pricks buy my father's sword, my mother's death mask, my brother's horse tack. Ah, Horst earned a pretty pile selling our mementos.
   1102002|00000000||No surprise the animosity you feel for him.
   1102004|00000000||That was but the start. My Iris' parents learned of my family's misfortune, and our betrothal was no more. They found her another suitor. One from beyond the sea.
   1102006|00000000||The anger I felt, I thought I'd go mad. Went to the tavern. Drank a round, a second… I brawled, then had another tankard. And then… then, I asked the wrong bloke for help.
   1101950|00000000||Yeah.
   1101953|00000000||All in all, not really. Just asking out of courtesy.
   1101955|00000000||Mhm. Commendable manners.
   1101951|00000000||No, not really.
   1101924|00000000||The Borsodis - what's your gripe? Get kicked out of an auction?
   1101926|00000000||Worse. They evicted me from my home.
   1101949|00000000||Are you really interested?
   1101834|00000000||The Borsodis - what's your gripe?
   1101839|00000000||Why'd you even need those papers?
   1101835|00000000||Why'd you need those papers?
   1107067|00000000||Did you know Horst had a brother?
   1107055|00000000||Awfully noble of you, showing so much concern for the needy.
   1107057|00000000||I couldn't give a rat's arse about the needy. May they wither and disappear along with the city.
   1107059|00000000||I wanted one thing. Revenge.
   1101920|00000000||Horst and Ewald are gnawing on soil now. But thanks to these papers, their relatives won't get the auction house. Family's lost it for good. And the hospital will have the funds it needs to treat orphans and beggars pro bono.
   1101636|00000000||Huh. It's progress.
   1101628|00000000||Made a deal with his brother. Who then beat the living shit out of Horst with a gold candle holder.
   1101597|00000000||Yes. I should have.
   1101626|00000000||I assume you came to an agreement with Horst. Shame. A right whoreson, that one.
   1101583|00000000||Dunno. Ask for legal advice? Looks to me like you might need some.
   1101586|00000000||You signed the contract, Olgierd. I'm just fulfilling its terms. To the letter. Unhappy? Hell, should've chosen your words more carefully.
   1101579|00000000||Ask for legal advice?
   1100591|00000000||The papers - where are they?
   1101567|00000000||Left them in the vault. You wanted the House, you got the House. Never mentioned its contents.
   1101575|00000000||You're a quick study. Already as tricky as O'Dimm himself. Keen to ridicule a man.
   1101577|00000000||Do you know what I and the company do with your type?
   1100587|00000000||Ah, Horst must be livid.
   1101666|00000000||He's not.
   1101668|00000000||No?
   1101670|00000000||He's not anything, except dead. His brother - same thing. A few others too.
   1101672|00000000||Stones you've got. But I didn't think you'd have the stomach for a massacre.
   1101691|00000000||Oh, think I might find the stomach for another. Once your final wish is fulfilled.
   1101693|00000000||Hah. You really don't like me, do you?
   1101695|00000000||Hate smartasses, hate it when they try to use me. It's why both brothers are dead. And why you should tread carefully.
   1101697|00000000||Noted. Now I've some advice for you.
   1101685|00000000||You underestimate me.
   1101684|00000000||Had no choice.
   1101687|00000000||Situation got out of hand.
   1101689|00000000||Hah! Oh, sounds familiar. There you are, drinking, puffing on henbane… and then - Surprise! - heads rolling across the floor. And none know how or why!
   1101716|00000000||I'm not amused.
   1101718|00000000||No? Why not?
   1101720|00000000||Cause unlike you, killing gives me no pleasure.
   1101723|00000000||The Borsodis aren't worth your tears. Sons of bitches, to a man.
   1101833|00000000||Why'd you need those papers?
   1101841|00000000||Why did you need those papers?
   1101894|00000000||Aimed to deliver those papers to the right hands. Borsodi would've landed in the streets. And the hospital would've gotten the funds it needs to treat orphans and beggars pro bono.
   1100577|00000000||Ah, that's better. Do you smoke?
   1101561|00000000||No. Supposed to be bad for you.
   1101564|00000000||Hah. You see? An advantage of being immortal.
   1101133|00000000||So, what have you brought me?
   1101145|00000000||A moment. I need to smoke.
   1101573|00000000||So, what have you brought me?
   1118753|00000000||No chatterin'! Kill!
   1118755|00000000||On your guards!
   1118757|00000000||Plough me!
   1118759|00000000||I'll shit on your grave!
   1118765|00000000||Come to papa! Come on!
   1118749|00000000||Thou shalt not suffer a mage to live!
   1118761|00000000||Faster, dammit! Faster!
   1118763|00000000||No! Nooo!

   1127416|00000000||Hey! Donkey! Lookin' for my geezer. Seen him?

   1098196|00000000||Tracks lead to the water. Dammit.
   1098198|00000000||Hugo's sleeping with the fish. No two ways about it - gotta find Eveline.
   1104132|00000000||Blood. Someone knocked their head on this beam. Open cut.
   1104134|00000000||Bare feet. Fresh prints.
   1104136|00000000||Looks like Hugo ran into trouble. Gotta find him. Fast.
   1104128|00000000||Blood… still moist. Nothing beyond that.
   1104142|00000000||Trail ends here… or continues underwater.
   1098175|00000000||Whoa, mate. Stuck your prick where you shouldn't have.
   1098179|00000000||Hey! Anyone in there?!
   1098181|00000000||Blood? Hm. This does not look good.
   1109336|00000000||You're going down.
   1109338|00000000||We shall see, my friend.
   1109346|00000000||You must find me before the sand in the hourglass runs out.
   1109348|00000000||Ready? Let's begin!
   1109319|00000000||Let's do this.
   1109320|00000000||Repeat the riddle.
   1109322|00000000||Didn't quite catch the riddle. Mind repeating it?
   1109324|00000000||To all things and men I appertain, and yet by some am shunned and disdained.
   1109326|00000000||Fondle and ogle me till you're insane, but no blow can harm me, cause me pain.
   1109328|00000000||Children delight in me, elders take fright, fair maids rejoice and spin.
   1109330|00000000||Cry, and I weep, yawn, and I sleep, smile, and I too shall grin.
   1110499|00000000||Wha… what's happening?
   1110505|00000000||You wished to play, so let us play.
   1110507|00000000||I shall tell you a riddle. Solve it, and both you and Olgierd will be free.
   1109310|00000000||And if I don't?
   1109312|00000000||Hahahaha, then we'll all three go for a wild ride. It's what you proposed, is it not?
   1109314|00000000||The riddle - lemme hear it.
   1108215|00000000||To all things and men I appertain, and yet by some am shunned and disdained.
   1108217|00000000||Fondle and ogle me, till you're insane, but no blow can harm me, cause me pain.
   1108219|00000000||Children delight in me, elders take fright, fair maids rejoice and spin.
   1108221|00000000||Cry, and I weep, yawn, and I sleep, smile, and I shall grin.
   1109316|00000000||What was that supposed to be?
   1109318|00000000||You tell me. What am I?
   1125400|00000000||Ugh… I sold my arse for a side o' bacon.
   1125467|00000000||Aah... aah... Aaah-choo!
   1125469|00000000||Flrrrp. A bit o' sauce'll drain the snot.
   1125471|00000000||Bacon don't fall far from the pig…
   1125405|00000000||Huh?
   1125403|00000000||What's new, witcher?
   1125407|00000000||Now you've fuckin' done it!
   1125409|00000000||Ahh, don't fuck with me.
   1124924|00000000||Herbalist's cart. Got some blood here.
   1102577|00000000||Don't like it when you're glum.
   1095818|00000000||I'm not. Have you seen Olgierd? Told him you fulfilled his wish?
   1102575|00000000||Don't be sad, Shani.
   1095816|00000000||I'm fine, really. And you were going to see Olgierd.
   1095857|00000000||Pretty, I guess. Thing is, will it cheer her up?
   1115679|00000000||Fine, I'll pick some. Becoming quite the romantic…
   1115676|00000000||[Pick.]
   1115681|00000000||Think I'll pass.
   1115677|00000000||[Leave.]
   1113412|00000000||A sip of something strong never hurt anyone. Question is, will it cheer her up?
   1115687|00000000||Here's hoping Shani's a happy drunk.
   1115682|00000000||[Take.]
   1115685|00000000||Good idea? Maybe not. She might be a sad drunk.
   1115683|00000000||[Leave.]
   1108891|00000000||Chamomile, looks like.
   1095859|00000000||A lad clutchin' stems is a lad caught at mischief… They never think to offer blooms 'less their stones're in a vice.
   1108889|00000000||Rowanberry brandy… Shani loves the blossoms, might enjoy this as well.
   1108887|00000000||A rowan… Shani mentioned she used to weave the berries into necklaces.
   1113410|00000000||Good mead oughta lift her spirits.
   1137627|00000000||Trail ends here. Hmm. Dirt and ground cover concealing a hatch. Secret passageway?
   1103547|00000000||Nowt? Sold us tickets, they did. Shiteaters.
   1103549|00000000||Could've apologized, the least.
   1103551|00000000||Meh. Artists - thievin' scum an' whores, every last one of 'em!
   1103705|00000000||Well, what's the hold up? Shoot!
   1112164|00000000||Are you cross-eyed or what?!
   1103708|00000000||Aim for the apple! The apple!
   1103702|00000000||Are you completely daft?
   1103567|00000000||Wonder if they need a new elf come every show.
   1103569|00000000||Most like. Just go to the forest an' trap 'em, like rabbits.
   1103573|00000000||Gods ha' mercy!
   1103575|00000000||Shoot him smack in the noggin, the mangy squirrel! Hehehe…
   1103577|00000000||I can't watch this! Tell us when it's over!
   1103579|00000000||Pfff. I could do that.
   1103581|00000000||Were I that elf, I believe I'd plain shit in my trousers.
   1103583|00000000||Were I that witcher, I wouldn't aim for the apple!
   1103585|00000000||Aye! Pointy-ears've shot droves of ours from the brush. Retribution, I say. Give 'em a taste of their own medicine!
   1103553|00000000||Folk say there's a rubbin' woman 'midst this troupe.
   1103555|00000000||A rubbin' woman? What's she do?
   1103557|00000000||You know. The kind that bends, does splits, wraps her legs round her head.
   1103648|00000000||Ah! A rubber lady! Tasteless however you cut it.
   1122593|00000000||What're you doin' here, Nemuel? Not at work?
   1122595|00000000||Afeared I'm out a job. Sawmill burnt down - thanks to the good knights of the Order of the Flaming Rose.
   1122814|00000000||First I've heard. What now?
   1122816|00000000||Agh, nothing. 'Twere monsters, we could hire a witcher. But none'll drive off those tin men.
   1124890|00000000||While searching a body he found in a ravaged campsite, Geralt found a key and a journal. Thinking the latter might shed light on its writer's fate, he slipped it into his bag.<br>
   1124891|00000000||Many tuck coin away for a rainy day. Most, however, choose more accessible places for their stash than the cellar. Geralt didn't ponder this choice of hiding places long, however, but instead pocketed the coin and went on his way.
   1124966|00000000||The notes contained information about a fortune hidden in a hut a griffin had roosted in. The coin had belonged to the deceased's aunt, but since neither she nor her nephew had any use for it now, Geralt decided to kill the beast and take it for himself.<br>
   1124882|00000000||Search the ruined hut's cellar.
   1124883|00000000||Read Knut Kreutzman's notes.
   1134729|00000000||A Surprise Inheritance
   1107010|00000000||Ran into your friend Countess Mignole.
   1107012|00000000||Ran into an old friend of yours… Countess Mignole.
   1107014|00000000||Huh? Impossible. Where?
   1107016|00000000||Auction house in Oxenfurt. She's an… aficionado, a collector. Witcher gear - imagine that. Old School of the Wolf armor, for instance.
   1107018|00000000||Hmm, right. A fine gambeson, that was. It had sleeves of chainmail and… Agh.
   1107093|00000000||Love letters conveyed by a governess, trysts in garden nooks, you scampering out a window… Heh. Last person I imagined dabbling in that sort of thing.
   1107095|00000000||Mgh, you might find it hard to believe, but… I was young too, once. Well, younger.
   1112515|00000000||She still lives in Oxenfurt. No itch to go there, see her?
   1112517|00000000||Later, maybe… Once it's over, once things're calm again.
   1115920|00000000||Sssssaah!
   1115922|00000000||You'll die here, fleshbag!
   1126239|00000000||So, the eastern front, and then…?
   1126822|00000000||Depends where they send me.
   1126824|00000000||Wherever it is, take care of yourself.
   1126826|00000000||Always do. So don't worry.
   1137744|00000000||Geralt, where do you think you're going?
   1137746|00000000||We were bound for the academy!
   1126809|00000000||To Radovid, there's little difference between the two.
   1126811|00000000||Seems to tolerate you well enough.
   1126813|00000000||Because he needs me. For now.
   1126235|00000000||So how're things at the academy these days?
   1126237|00000000||You mean since Radovid shut it down?
   1130114|00000000||I mean, is it well guarded.
   1126803|00000000||Might be all it is. Many of the faculty fled to the far north. The braver ones stayed, but assumed the guises of tailors and laundresses. Why?
   1126807|00000000||Just curious. Scholars seemed to have adopted mage tactics. They in the same bind?
    346758|c7f8d31d||Guard
   1137611|cfab3b70||Alexy von Everec
   1118277|00000000||Burned to a crisp. Everything…
   1118021|00000000||Ugh, reeks in here.
   1122488|00000000||Then von Everec ceased to be human.
   1128665|00000000||Though he still loved his wife.
   1128667|00000000||No. He merely remembered that he should love her.
   1128669|00000000||Let's go upstairs.
   1126063|00000000||Damn candles…
    432462|d9e76521||Vimme Vivaldi
    337979|df72b608||Imlerith
   1126785|00000000||Need to talk to this professor.
   1126787|00000000||We'll go together. Redanian guards all over the academy. Doubt you'll get in alone.
   1126789|00000000||Guards've never stopped me, you know that.
   1126791|00000000||Mhm. But wound these, and I'll have to patch them up.
   1126793|00000000||Besides, we might run into a friend. Get inside free and easy.
   1126700|00000000||Need to see this professor.
   1126701|00000000||Mage hunters - why're they at his door?
   1126709|00000000||Mage hunters at the door… He under house arrest?
   1126711|00000000||I can't say, really. Some of the faculty think him a traitor - say he sold out to the hunters for a hefty pouch of gold.
   1126713|00000000||The assistant, on the other hand, insists the professor wants them there to protect him. I don't know what from.
   1126715|00000000||What's your guess?
   1126717|00000000||He's certainly useful to them. A specialist in black magic and the occult? Must be a trove of knowledge.
   1126719|00000000||If he's really gone off his nutter, I wouldn't be surprised to see them using him.
   1094576|00000000||So, learn anything about Olgierd?
   1094596|00000000||Well, I abandoned the books quickly. Decided that if I was going to learn the truth, I'd need to find someone who knows him.
   1102323|00000000||Find anyone?
   1102325|00000000||Turned out I didn't need to look far. A colleague at the academy, an assistant to Professor Premethine Shakeslock, claims Olgierd von Everec met with the professor multiple times.
   1102327|00000000||Apparently Olgierd asked the professor to do some research. Professor got so worked up doing it, he went daffy. Started jealously guarding his notes. Wouldn't even let his assistant look at them.
   1103628|00000000||The professor - where'll I find him?
   1102329|00000000||Here in Oxenfurt. Cloistered inside his house on Academy grounds. Mage hunters guard his door.
   1102285|00000000||Learn anything about Olgierd?
   1102286|00000000||This departure, so sudden. Why?
   1102331|00000000||Never mentioned you'd be moving. Any intention to, either.
   1103535|00000000||I didn't know I would be. Found out this morning.
   1103537|00000000||Two soldiers came to my door. Said Redania needs me again.
   1103539|00000000||Couldn't turn 'em down, just say no?
   1103541|00000000||Ah, perhaps I could've. But I didn't want to. Treating the ill and wounded, it's my calling. No place I'm needed more than at the front.
   1103587|00000000||Can't you reconsider… and stay?
   1103589|00000000||Geralt, what for?
   1103591|00000000||The wedding, the time we've spent together… it was nice. But you have your life, and I have mine. We-- This doesn't make sense long-term. You know that as well as I do.
   1130106|00000000||Well… you take care of yourself.
   1103597|00000000||You too, Geralt.
   1103560|00000000||Don't go.
   1103561|00000000||I see.
   1103559|00000000||I understand. Any chance we'll see each other again?
   1130108|00000000||Someday, I'm sure.
   1130100|00000000||Shani?
   1123189|00000000||Oh, Geralt. Good thing you're here.
   1094564|00000000||What happened? Somebody break in?
   1102282|00000000||This? Ah, no. Just getting ready to move.
   1102284|00000000||What? When? Where to?
   1103370|00000000||Ah, not what I wanted to talk to you about, or at least not only, but…
   1103533|00000000||I'm leaving, Geralt. The eastern front beckons. I'm Kaedwen bound.
   1115147|00000000||Nothing better to do?
   1117866|00000000||Don't you have anything better to do?
   1117868|00000000||Not at the moment. Make no mistake, you cannot evade this. You must answer my questions, promptly and in full.
   1115152|00000000||Might've, once or twice…
   1117964|00000000||Might've… once or twice. Definitely no more than three times.
   1117966|00000000||And did you then file a WIPT-30/c form with the Revenue and Customs office for your place of residence? No? As I thought!
   1115159|00000000||Unfortunately, I have.
   1117994|00000000||Yeah, unfortunately, on occasion. But I didn't know it was illegal.
   1117996|00000000||"Ignorantia legis non excusat," as the ancient Vrans would say. Ignorance of the law excuses no one!
   1115164|00000000||A couple times, maybe…
   1118017|00000000||A couple times… But the owners never protested.
   1118019|00000000||In the eyes of the law that is no excuse, my good man!
   1118037|00000000||And done. Here.
   1118039|00000000||What's this?
   1118041|00000000||A summons to pay back taxes. Please report to the Vivaldi Bank with this document posthaste.
   1118043|00000000||But-- But I've never paid any taxes, not one copper!
   1118045|00000000||Precisely! Yet you've had the obligation always! Thus the arrears! I advise you well - do not treat this matter lightly!
   1130577|00000000||Ugh. Paper pushers.
   1118054|00000000||It adds up… to the crown! I say, good sir, you are exceptionally upstanding!
   1118056|00000000||It'd be rude to disagree.
   1118058|00000000||In these times, such civic virtue is a rarity. It must be commended, rewarded. Here.
   1118061|00000000||Wha… what's this?
   1118063|00000000||A diploma. I bestow on you the title of Taxpayer in Good Standing. I'd suggest you frame it, hang it in a place of honor. Congratulations!
   1115172|00000000||Now, if you could wait for one moment… Compare column B to Table VII, apply the rate for confirmed, childless bachelors, a tax credit of seven-point-three percent for practitioners of hazardous professions…
   1118015|00000000||Gotta be kidding! The witchers' code forbids it!
   1118023|00000000||I'm pleased to hear you abide by your guild's by-laws.
   1115163|00000000||No, nuh-uh, never.
   1117999|00000000||Now, for the final question. Have you ever unlawfully acquired another man's movable goods, chattels?
   1118011|00000000||Hmmm. Meaning?
   1118013|00000000||Agh. Meaning, have you ever waltzed into someone's home and taken something without their permission?
   1117992|00000000||No, never done anything of the sort. Witcher's honor.
   1115158|00000000||No, never.
   1117968|00000000||Right… next. During the current fiscal year, have you engaged in the acquisition of bivalves with the express intention of selling the pearls therein?
   1117970|00000000||Even if I have, what's wrong with that?
   1117982|00000000||Article 86, section 3 of the Tax Code: "Whosever purchases goods at an unseemly low price to take advantage of the seller's ignorance, shall be subject to a fine equaling two hundred percent of the earnings from any such a transaction." Sound familiar?
   1117984|00000000||And now, please answer. Have you, or have you not, dealt in said pearls?
   1117961|00000000||This some kind of joke? 'Course not.
   1115151|00000000||Me? Never!
   1117895|00000000||Profession?
   1117897|00000000||Witcher. Monster slayer.
   1117899|00000000||Mhm… Sole proprietorship, service sector. Type of services rendered: rat/pest/monster removal.
   1117902|00000000||Moving on. Have you at any time engaged in the wholesale trade of rawhide in the White Orchard area?
   1117864|00000000||I get how that might've happened. Be glad to clear them up.
   1115146|00000000||Be happy to clear them up.
   1115142|00000000||Halt! You there! Please wait! You're Geralt of Rivia, are you not?
   1115144|00000000||Depends who's asking.
   1117853|00000000||Revenue and Customs for Occupied Temeria, Dorian branch. Represented by yours truly, Deputy Tax Enumerator Walthemor Mitty.
   1117855|00000000||Honored, I guess. What seems to be the problem?
   1117857|00000000||In brief, undeclared income.
   1117859|00000000||Scuse me?
   1117861|00000000||We've had reports, numerous, that over the last months you've come into a great deal of coin - quickly. So quickly it's raised suspicions.
   1058289|0a09c08e||Bilge Hag
    577978|fcd21ea9||Halfling

   1113110|00000000||Nahaz a'zaza!
   1116512|00000000||Brrrp! And tomorrow, we do it all again!
   1116514|00000000||Brr, pickled herrin'. No better chaser for vodka! Ech.
   1127393|00000000||Oh, love them ears, mate! Heh…
   1097661|00000000||Looks bleak to me.
   1097672|00000000||Looks bleak to me. Tower wall's smooth as glass. Don't know about you, but I can't scale that, and--
   1097674|00000000||And I've not asked you to. Let me finish.
   1097765|00000000||Well, you've returned. What's this mean? Decided to join me after all?
   1097844|00000000||All right, I'm off. Got a bit to do.
   1097846|00000000||As do I. Get it all done, and we'll meet back here.
   1097848|00000000||What then?
   1097850|00000000||Then we'll bugger Horst up, down and sideways. All together.
   1096870|00000000||Time I was on my way.
   1097795|00000000||As far as I know, his troop's made camp east of Oxenfurt, on the right bank of the Pontar.
   1097793|00000000||Ah, right, the famed Hans. Went out with his pals to hunt monsters. Turned out they were shit at it. I know the man.
   1097797|00000000||Hm. So I'd have to rip one from his cozy home, the other from a cozy cage. Need to think about it.
   1106950|00000000||Hans or the beast?
   1106952|00000000||Both, actually.
   1106948|00000000||I know the man. Slew an archgriffin for him. Mean fiend, pretty much.
   1097058|00000000||All right, opening the vault - who do we have?
   1097060|00000000||Let's start with the fact that one of 'em's a dwarf.
   1097784|00000000||Casimir Bassi, native of Mahakam. A specialist in controlled explosions. Folk say he could blow Novigrad to the high heavens with but a pinch of saltpeter. Vault door for him should be a cinch.
   1097786|00000000||The problem is Casimir apparently hung up his detonators some time ago. He married, sired some littler ones, and settled in the village of Alness. Might plain turn us down.
   1097791|00000000||Any options?
   1097062|00000000||Quinto. The North's most famed safecracker. Arrest warrants out on him in Kaedwen, Lyria, Angren and Kovir. Sadly, he got nabbed a few days back. By one Hans of Cidaris, a prick mercenary.
   1096869|00000000||Opening the vault - what're our options?
   1124006|00000000||What's this about culling the patrols? Told you - no one dies.
   1124008|00000000||Easy. I don't want anyone's death. Just need some folk to be temporarily indisposed.
   1124010|00000000||Spit it out.
   1124012|00000000||You've got to approach the garrison's cook, convince him to spike the soldiers' nosh with somethin' to keep some of them bedridden. One in two, let's say. Wouldn't want to raise suspicions.
   1124014|00000000||Hmm. Know the formula for a potion that might do the trick.
   1124016|00000000||There, see? Brew up a bit o' that, hit the town, find the cook, then convince him to do you a favor. I don't know, cast a spell, toss him some coin… you could also use your fists.
   1124004|00000000||Culling the patrols - what's that about?
   1096867|00000000||Getting inside - who do we have?
   1097050|00000000||Break-in artists - tell me about them. Assuming lack of vertigo to be the first requirement.
   1097052|00000000||Mh. Precisely why my favorite's Eveline Gallo, a circus artist known better as "The Ermine." Just now performing with her troupe somewhere near Oxenfurt. Her specialities - rhythmic gymnastics and tightrope walking.
   1097818|00000000||Uh, breaking and entering?
   1097834|00000000||Not officially, no, but… I've compared the route her troupe's taken with a list of the most audacious thefts in recent years. A perfect match. Highly doubt that's a coincidence.
   1097836|00000000||But if she's reluctant, we've another option in Hugo Hoff, alias "Beef Patty." A halfling.
   1097838|00000000||Think he's fit? Pudgy face - doesn't really match my image of a criminal.
   1097840|00000000||You'd be surprised. Hugo's notched up more break-ins than you've felled monsters. More importantly, two years past he nicked the gold-plated cock from the roof of the town hall in Novigrad. So, the half-man's a climber.
   1097842|00000000||Word has it he's holed up in Oxenfurt in a house near the Novigrad Gate. Be careful. He's modest in size but apparently wicked dangerous.
   1097767|00000000||Agh, don't really have any other options. So be it. I'm in… but on one condition - no one dies. That clear?
   1097769|00000000||As the Great Sun of Nilfgaard. How about we knock back a round - toast a mutually beneficial relationship?
   1097772|00000000||Rather get to work. What comes first?
   1097775|00000000||First you've to assemble the crew, then… there's the Redanian patrols to cull a bit. Too many wanderin' round, we could get noticed.
   1097730|00000000||So be it.
   1097740|00000000||Hm. Gotta give it some thought.
   1097742|00000000||I get that. Think it over. You know where to find me.
   1097731|00000000||Lemme think about it.
   1097695|00000000||For this to work, we need two more accomplices. One to scale the tower, drop us a line. The other to open the vault - a safecracker or a demolition specialist.
   1097697|00000000||I've already identified some promising candidates. All we've to do is select and recruit the best among them. Also your job. I'd, uh, prefer to remain largely out of sight.
   1097701|00000000||Mhm. Assumed as much given your hood. Anything else?
   1097703|00000000||Aye… But that's among the details. Which you will learn just as soon as you declare.
   1097668|00000000||Not all bad, except… sounds like a lot of work for two.
   1097670|00000000||I'm fully aware of that.
   1097660|00000000||Sounds solid.
   1123973|00000000||I'm not a thief.
   1123975|00000000||It's opportunity makes the thief, witcher. I speak from experience.
   1096691|00000000||Ugh. Talk.
   1096725|00000000||Twenty Redanian soldiers guard the auction house. Day and night. Patrols walk in circles around it, and here, past this corner - barracks.
   1096727|00000000||Brute force is out. Gotta get in quietly.
   1097626|00000000||Exactly. Not the simplest thing, though. Main entrance - armored door. Windows - dimeritium bars.
   1097638|00000000||But, not a fortress out there without a weakness. This one's no different.
   1097657|00000000||Patience happens to be my weakness. So dispense with the dramatic pauses and talk.
   1097659|00000000||Ahem. Beside the house stands a tower, from which we can enter the attic. We can't hope to enter the tower from the street on account o' the patrols. But there's a window sixty feet off the ground. No shutters, no bars.
   1097666|00000000||We've got to get up there and sneak across to the auction house. Then down the stairs to the cellar. Crack open or blow off the vault door - and voilà.
   1096142|00000000||I'm no thief.
   1097064|00000000||Before we go any further - you even know what Max Borsodi's House is?
   1097066|00000000||I know it's in the vault.
   1097068|00000000||Didn't answer my question.
   1097615|00000000||Neither have you. Willin' to help with the heist or not?
   1097592|00000000||Maximilian Borsodi's House - know what it is?
   1101206|00000000||The vault - what's in there for you?
   1101208|00000000||Something that was stolen from me.
   1101210|00000000||Hm. Oughta go to the City Watch, tell them a crime's been committed. Not organize a heist.
   1101212|00000000||I've tried. Repeatedly.
   1101214|00000000||I see. Cheated by the system, wronged by the world. Doesn't matter. What'd they take?
   1101216|00000000||List'd take a good while… so I'd rather change the subject. You in, or not?
   1101204|00000000||What do you want to take from the vault?
   1096143|00000000||Don't even know your name.
   1096156|00000000||Come on. I don't even know your name.
   1096689|00000000||What's that matter?
   1097594|00000000||Matters 'cause you're clearly hiding something. Not just from me, either. Wouldn't be sitting in a cellar in this shithole otherwise.
   1097596|00000000||We've all some stain on our conscience. But I've not asked for your hand in marriage. Just for your help in a heist.
   1097598|00000000||We break in, each take what we need, then go our own ways.
   1097601|00000000||Try to trick me anyway, anyhow, you won't go anywhere, you know that. 'Cause I'll take your head off right where it meets your neck.
   1097603|00000000||I'm aware of the risks. So, now that you've threatened me and all… are you in or are you not?
   1096137|00000000||You've come. Good.
   1097577|00000000||Remains to be seen. Aimed to tell me something, I think, so talk.
   1097579|00000000||How do I put this… We share a goal. We both need to get into the Borsodis' vault. Both want something that's in there. Why not pool our strengths?
   1097581|00000000||Sorry, but what exactly is yours?
   1097583|00000000||I've a plan.
   1097585|00000000||…
   1097587|00000000||Spent the last year working on it - on paper. Time to set it in motion. You one I can count on?

   1138024|00000000||Ptooey. Time to fight, Geralt. May the better man win.
   1128779|00000000||Let the music play on!
   1138018|00000000||You fight well, Geralt.
   1138020|00000000||I've long not faced a foe so fierce.
   1138022|00000000||Bravo, Geralt! You force me to strive!

   1128785|00000000||Excellent!
   1128781|00000000||Nicely done!

   1138002|00000000||Damn it! Closer, witcher!
   1138004|00000000||Finish it, sir!
   1137998|00000000||Fight, damn you! Ptooey!

   1107818|00000000||All right, move along.
   1107876|00000000||Stop that.

   1137085|00000000||Geralt has escaped a great many predicaments, sometimes of his own doing, sometimes aided by others. One of the strangest helping hands was that extended to him by Master Mirror. The witcher was on an Ofieri ship, held captive and bound for a date with the gallows... when, out of nowhere, in came Master Mirror. He reminded the witcher of their first encounter, when he helped Geralt find Yennefer in White Orchard. Now he was offering help as well -- this time, for a price. In exchange for freeing Geralt from the ship, he demanded Geralt meet him at a certain crossroads. When the witcher agreed, a strange mark appeared on his face. It was as though Master Mirror had put a stamp on him to show they had entered into as pact – a suspicion later confirmed beyond all doubt...<br>
   1137086|00000000||Gaunter O’Dimm explained he and their mutual acquaintance, Olgierd von Everec, had entered into a strange pact. Their deal stipulated O’Dimm would have to grant von Everec three wishes. Yet he could not do so on his own, having to call instead upon the services of a proxy. And who better to provide such assistance than a witcher? Since O’Dimm made agreeing to be this proxy a condition for receiving help off the Ofieri ship, Geralt had little choice but to agree.<br><br>Master Mirror appeared once again – suddenly and out of nowhere, as usual – after Olgierd proclaimed his first two wishes. Mirror told Geralt of a way to show Olgierd’s brother the time of his life, even though this life had in fact ended years earlier. He equipped Geralt with von Everec blood and the knowledge of how to summon Vlodimir’s ghost. Just how O’Dimm had managed to collect a vial of von Everec blood was never made clear, but then again, burning question marks hung over everything this strange figure did.<br>
   1137087|00000000||Master Mirror made an appearance at the wedding Geralt attended with Shani and the ghost of Vlodimir, who inhabited Geralt’s body so that he may enjoy one last night of earthly revelry. When midnight struck, Vlodimir was unsurprisingly in no mood to abandon the pleasures of the witcher’s flesh. Yet Master Mirror intervened to put an immediate and cruel end to Vlod’s stay among the living. Geralt later told me the cries of torment Vlod’s ghost made haunted his dreams for months to come.<br>
   1137088|00000000||Geralt came away from his meeting with Professor Shakeslock knowing of a way to outfox Master Mirror. The demonic pact-maker could be lured into a wager: win it, and he would be defeated once and for all.<br>
   1137089|00000000||Geralt decided to deliver Olgierd to Master Mirror's murky hands, thus completing their bargain. Geralt knew it was over at once, for in that moment the mark which had appeared on his face on the Ofieri ship disappeared like charcoal smudges drenched in a rain shower. That was the last Geralt ever saw of Master Mirror. I do not think he was missed.
   1137090|00000000||Geralt soon discovered Professor Shakeslock's words were true. Master Mirror could indeed be defeated at his own game. Geralt made a bet with him, wagering everything on one battle of wits, and won. By solving Master Mirror's riddle, he drove the demon from our dimension – though I fear he may yet return. His kind always returns.

   1120672|00000000||What sport is this? Blustering about after pigs, are you?
   1120674|00000000||Lads're racin' to be crowned King o' the Swineherds. And win the prize that comes with it for their wench - um, lady, meanin'.
   1120703|00000000||And the rules? One must be a swineherd's son to enter, I suppose?
   1120705|00000000||Naay, any man can try his luck. All you need is to herd the piggies dabbed in yellow into the pen.
   1122100|00000000||The prizes - tell me more.
   1122102|00000000||King of the swineherds, eh? And what's this king get, exactly? A king's ransom, I would hope?
   1122104|00000000||No coin. Honor's the prize. King gets a crown o' laurels he pins to his saddle, rides about with pride that he's King of the Swineherds.
   1122243|00000000||You mentioned some trifles for the lasses - are they worthwhile at least?
   1122245|00000000||For certain! Lovely, every last one, pretty as a painting! Win and see for yourself!
   1122099|00000000||Let's chase some pigs!
   1122087|00000000||Sounds like damned foolish nonsense - but why not give it a try?
   1124928|00000000||We'd be honored!
   1124647|00000000||Get that cripple outta there! Couldn't chase his own wench into a bed, let alone a pig into a pen! Let the witcher give it a run.
   1124653|00000000||A witcher with ass ears chasing swine… hahaha. Better than a goddamned circus.
   1124930|00000000||What's that you say, peasant?
   1124935|00000000||Me? Uhhh, nothing.
   1124937|00000000||Good. Keep it that way.
   1120632|00000000||Look at the fools fallin' over themselves to catch a painted pig!
   1120634|00000000||Smearin' their wedding garb with muck!
   1120636|00000000||Aha! Finally, a manly man's sport!
   1121246|00000000||Stupid swine. They infuriate me anymore, I'll whack them with some sign.
   1121218|00000000||You see that, Shani! One pig penned!
   1123259|00000000||C'mon, piggy. Got a nice and cozy pen for you.
   1121165|00000000||Shame there's no painter here. It's a moment worth immortalizing for posterity.
   1121167|00000000||Watch my movements, Shani. I'm spry as a cat and sly as a fox… I'll show these imbeciles how one chases a porker.

   1123151|00000000||Come back! We must talk!
   1131873|00000000||How about this…
   1131852|00000000||[Place candles on the circle surrounding the pentagram.]
   1131876|00000000||Maybe this?
   1131879|00000000||Nope. Botched it, I guess.
   1131853|00000000||[Place candles on the vertices and the circle.]

   1131846|00000000||Egh… Black magic.
   1131849|00000000||That should do it. Now for the candles.

   1131882|00000000||Dammit - smack in the middle of a raging blizzard! Gotta find shelter, get inside.

   1103440|00000000||Geralt, ye thought o' buyin' real estate? Could get ye attractive terms on a mortgage.
   1103442|00000000||No such thing as attractive loan terms, Vimme.
   1103490|00000000||What about in Koviri marks?
   1103492|00000000||Come on. You know damn well that makes no cents.
   1139392|00000000||<i>How doth the little wild boar<br>Improve his shining tusks,<br>And rut them ‘gainst the forest floor,<br>And on the trees’ rough husks!<br><br>How cheerfully he seems to grin<br>How neatly spreads his claws,<br>And welcomes little lasses in,<br>With gently smiling jaws!</i><br>Louis of Charolle, mathematician, author and poet<br><br>These woodland beasts are as “wild” – untamed, nasty and aggressive – as their name indicates. To this day, many peasants in outlying Kaedweni villages believe wild boars persist on a diet of young maids, though in truth they most often slate their hunger with roots and acorns. Do not think this vegetarian diet makes them harmless, however. In fact, these animals’ stout build and sharp teeth render them veritable fur-covered combat machines. Mother Nature has additionally equipped them with dual pairs of tusks - upper "pipes" and lower "sabres" - and this weaponry's sum effect is to make the beasts the terrors of the woods, a threat to all who venture or dwell there, human, humanoid and otherwise. Boars also have hard, club-like snouts, which some peasants call their “whistles,” though no boar has ever been heard to make such a noise. Instead, they emit a characteristic grunt, which sounds to some like the snoring of an extremely overweight man. Another peasant belief claims boars have extremely prickly natures, and, if offended, will vent their anger by knocking down fences and gobbling up potatoes. Though they sometimes live alone, boars usually appear in small groups of 3 to 5 specimens.<br>
   1139393|00000000||Boars move with lightning speed and can attack a foe from the rear with a powerful kick of their hind hooves and slice those coming at them from the front with their sharp tusks. A wise strategy is to catch a boar (or boars, if fighting a pack and the possibility arises) in an Yrden trap, or to set alight their fur with the Igni Sign.

   1113687|00000000||This some sorta sick farce?
   1113690|00000000||You that mad cunt who hunted kings?
   1113692|00000000||That bloody Nilfgaardian 'imperior' can kiss me down there.

   1130900|00000000||The Ofieri runewright provided Geralt with very good runes and glyphs, but still was not able to exercise his art to its fullest. To forge the best tools and components, he needed painite, a very rare mineral. Geralt was interested in the best of the best, however, so he set out to visit Novigrad market stalls, in the hope that one of them would have painite crystal on offer.<br>
   1130901|00000000||Geralt's hunt for painite crystal ended in success. The mineral cost him quite the hefty sum, but from then on the Ofieri master had everything he needed to create runewords and glyphwords of the highest quality.
   1130902|00000000||Visit Novigrad merchants and see if any have painite for sale.
   1130904|00000000||Take the painite to the Ofieri runewright.

   1114253|00000000||The nature of Geralt's trade means finding corpses is a normal part of a day's work. This time the body was  found atop an observation tower near the village of Mohrin. Upon closer inspection, Geralt found the man's throat had been slit – and had some highly interesting papers in his pockets...<br>
   1114254|00000000||Geralt was able to find the spy's stash, which he then eagerly emptied of its contents. Not the noblest of actions, perhaps, but was it not better the coin went to the witcher's pouch and not the grubby paws of the Order's bandits?
   1114275|00000000||The letter revealed the man had been a Nilfgaardian spy. Disguised as a tinker named Krister, he had been following the movements of knights from the disbanded Order. It seems Krister had not exercised due caution, for his spy career had been cut short by a slash of a renegade knight's blade. The most interesting information in the letter, however, concerned the location of the considerable stash of coin Nilfgaard had devoted to this spying operation...<br>

   1101555|00000000||Take one down, pass her around, ninety-nine barrels of rum on the wall! Hah!
   1101703|00000000||Heheh, aye. Aye, rum in ninety-nine barrels - that'd be a good time!
   1101725|00000000||Whaddaya say we look for the cellar, cozy up to a hefty jug?
   1101727|00000000||Agh, you're drunk! Go home, you sots!
   1128056|00000000||"Gillian Alboco's Lesser Key." Tome's about demons. Dusty as they come…
   1128058|00000000||Silver Lamen… Don't know the sigil. Hasn't been used in ages, looks like…
   1128101|00000000||Shattered mirror… No sign of impact, probably not an accident.
   1128400|00000000||Shattered by a sound, maybe? Someone look in it and scream?
   1126243|00000000||Locked tight.
   1126245|00000000||Need another way in.
   1126903|00000000||He leave a window open, maybe?
   1117472|00000000||Your eyes, why, they're just like a cat's!
   1117470|00000000||Never mix, never - hic! - wo-worry! That's… that's my motto.
   1127424|00000000||Ass ears, cat eyes. Oh, fuck, I'm drunk…
   1105756|00000000||You don't give a shit.
   1105759|00000000||You don't give a shit, Olgierd.
   1105761|00000000||You'd make piss poor company for a talk about love, anyway.
   1105755|00000000||No, I've never loved.
   1105762|00000000||No. Haven't loved. Now let's get to the point.
   1105934|00000000||You're lying - I can tell. Come, now, let's go inside, discuss this over some fiery water?
   1105754|00000000||Yes, I've loved.
   1105772|00000000||Yeah. I've loved. Can we get to the matter at hand?
   1105774|00000000||Perhaps instead we ought to sit down inside, have a good chat over some fiery water?
   1105782|00000000||We'll drink once the job's done.
   1105784|00000000||Afraid that's impossible. Succeed, and that's the end of me. Fail, and you'll not be back.
   1105776|00000000||Once it's over, once the job's done.
   1105775|00000000||I don't want to drink with you.
   1105780|00000000||Not about to drink with you.
   1105788|00000000||Third wish - still waiting to hear it.
   1105940|00000000||My, aren't you stubborn. Fine, listen well. I had a wife once. The day I saw her last, I gave her a rose, a violet one.
   1105942|00000000||Bring me that bloom. Wouldn't mind remindin' myself what it looks like.
   1105944|00000000||Mhhh, when was that? How long's it been? Flower's wilted and turned to dust by now.
   1105946|00000000||You wished to hear a wish - now you have. Fulfill it. I ride now to visit this Dauntless, but one of my men'll remain here. He'll know how to find me. That is, of course, should you succeed.
   1105948|00000000||Least you could tell me where your wife is.
   1105950|00000000||In my old manor, east of Martin Feuille's farmstead. I'd wish you gods speed, but - well, you understand, I'm sure. Goodbye, Geralt.
   1105764|00000000||In no mood for a heart-to-heart. I'm to do something for you. Tell me what it is.
   1105766|00000000||A true professional, eh? Know what I think? I think you only feign the cold killer, when in fact you seek new and ever stronger sensations - as I do. Seek to prove to yourself that you're are still able to feel, that some remnant of humanity remains within you.
   1105768|00000000||I'd make a right good witcher. Problem is, I don't know the road to Kaer Morhen, and I doubt you'd give me a pendant.
   1105770|00000000||Cut the shit, Olgierd.
   1105753|00000000||Your third wish. Now.
   1105746|00000000||Fulfilled two of your wishes. Time I learned the third.
   1105748|00000000||Confident, aren't you? Proud, sure of your strengths, fearless…
   1105750|00000000||Third task. If you don't mind.
   1105752|00000000||Mutations - they stripped you of emotion. Tell me, have you ever loved? I mean truly loved?
   1105713|00000000||Third task - let's talk about it.
   1105738|00000000||Must've made quite a few enemies along the way. Maybe not today and not tomorrow, but someday, someone'll find a way to take you down.
   1105740|00000000||And that should trouble me why? I feel no fear, no regret…
   1105742|00000000||The wise men of Oxenfurt claim there are no gods. After death, there is only the void.
   1105744|00000000||I've known this void already. Death holds no surprises.
   1105715|00000000||You'll get what's coming to you one day.
   1105714|00000000||Why were you keeping that man in a barrel?
   1105726|00000000||Barrel - what was that about?
   1105728|00000000||On the way here we stopped for nourishment at a tavern belonging to one Lord Dauntless. We enjoyed ourselves as one does at an inn - raucously.
   1108494|00000000||Our antics were not to the liking of this Dauntless. Sent a man to warn us that if we were ever to return, we would hang.
   1105730|00000000||You burn the inn down?
   1105732|00000000||I left ample compensation with the innkeep. But it seems the rapscallion neglected to mention this to his lord.
   1105734|00000000||But that's of little import. What matters is someone called me a whoreson and threatened to kill me.
   1105736|00000000||It was one of those threats that sound like an invitation. I intend to accept it, return to those parts.
   1107009|00000000||The Ofieri believe one should only discuss important matters out of doors, with the gods as witnesses.
   1137144|00000000||Sadly, Geralt never got to see if the dwarf lived up to his reputation, for he blew himself into a fine mist soon after the witcher met him, bringing his criminal career to a halt before what would have been its crowning moment. The culprits behind this catastrophe were multiple: Casimir's moody temperament, his unfaithful wife and a certain virile postman.
   1137145|00000000||The dwarf's role would be to bypass the vault doors using explosives. True, Casimir seemed an unreliable partner in crime, given his oscillations between rage and despair after learning of his wife's cuckoldry, but Geralt decided to risk it and enlist the dwarf in his crew.<br>
   1137146|00000000||Bassi's method were far from subtle, but no one can deny their effectiveness. His skillfully placed explosives blew the vault door to pieces, opening the way for the crew to grab the valuables within. The dwarf walked away laden with riches and clearly no longer bothered by his wife's infidelity.
   1137634|00000000||In a strange sequence of events Geralt found himself participating in the robbery of the Borsodis' Auction House in Oxenfurt. How this came about is a fascinating story – which must be left for another time. Let us here focus on a few facts: the witcher was tasked with putting together a crew of expert thieves and break-in artists. One of the candidates was a certain Casimir Bassi, a demolitions specialist who had cut his teeth in the mines of Mahakam...<br>
   1137642|00000000||Bassi's method were far from subtle, but no one can deny their effectiveness. His skillfully-placed explosives blew the vault doors to pieces, opening the way for the crew to grab the valuables within. The dwarf was not given long to enjoy his newly-begotten wealth, however: when the witcher and the surviving Borsodi brother dueled, Casimir supported the losing horse – and paid for this mistake with his life.

   1128099|00000000||This is my house…
   1128625|00000000||Leave before it's too late…
   1128629|00000000||Turn back…
   1128627|00000000||My house…
   1128631|00000000||You will die here…
   1128633|00000000||Thief…
   1128635|00000000||I'm afraid…
   1128637|00000000||Who comes…?
   1128095|00000000||Begone…
   1126930|00000000||We won. That's all that matters.
   1095164|00000000||Master Mirror… agh, the details don't matter. I beat him. You're free.
   1104383|00000000||I thank you. Though I've no notion what to do with this freedom, now.
   1104401|00000000||Mirror took everything. Everything I loved, all I held dear…
   1104403|00000000||Not true. Got your heart back.
   1104405|00000000||A bitter victory. Now at last I sense how much I've lost.
   1104407|00000000||I've a heart again, yet all it feels is grief, sadness and defeat. My life is a ruin.
   1119526|00000000||True. I don't envy you.
   1119540|00000000||Hm, can't say I envy you. As the saying goes, careful what you wish for.
   1119542|00000000||Oh, I shall be, believe me.
   1119545|00000000||Actually, I've a better idea - I'll never wish for anything again.
   1119547|00000000||It's time I took fate into my own hands. Lived life anew… and truly, this time.
   1119886|00000000||Sounds like a plan.
   1119905|00000000||I'll never forget what you did for me, witcher.
   1119907|00000000||I have something for you.
   1119910|00000000||Can't accept this.
   1119912|00000000||You can and must. This saber's been in my family for generations. Even when I'd lost all else, it remained at my side. Means a great deal to me.
   1119914|00000000||All the more reason why I can't take it.
   1119916|00000000||Do me the honor. This'll mark the start of my new life - and such a weapon could be right useful to you.
   1119918|00000000||Thank you.
   1119944|00000000||Ow.
   1119946|00000000||Sorry.
   1119948|00000000||You needn't be.
   1134236|00000000||I thank you again, Geralt. And good luck on the Path.
   1119922|00000000||Good luck to you, too.
   1119534|00000000||You've handled tougher situations. You'll figure this one out.
   1119536|00000000||Got a company of faithful comrades waiting. Got a home, your fortune…
   1119538|00000000||No. I cannot live as I did before.
   1119572|00000000||So what'll you do?
   1119574|00000000||I don't know.
   1119576|00000000||But one thing's clear - it's time I took fate into my own hands. Lived life anew… and truly, this time.
   1119525|00000000||Don't worry, it'll all work out.
   1095182|00000000||O'Dimm decided to have some fun at my expense. Devised a game I was supposed to lose.
   1104376|00000000||Seems he'd forgotten the training you put me through - in doing the undoable.
   1104378|00000000||Sought only to protect myself. In doing so, I put you in harm's way. Forgive me.
   1104380|00000000||Hm. Well, don't have to worry about him anymore. You're safe. And free.
   1126929|00000000||Mirror dragged me into a game.
   1126931|00000000||Why don't you tell me what it's like to have a heart of stone?
   1119502|00000000||First off, you tell me what it's like to have a heart of stone.
   1119504|00000000||Ah, it's wonderful at the start.
   1119506|00000000||You feel no fear, no angst… but also no concern, no care for anyone, not even those you loved.
   1119508|00000000||And gradually you lose them… Well, you know how it ended.
   1119510|00000000||What about your senses? Taste, smell?
   1119874|00000000||All there. At first, I savored the world like never before. It was stronger, more clear.
   1119876|00000000||How's that possible?
   1119512|00000000||I did not wish for a heart of stone. That was a mere… side effect.
   1119514|00000000||I wished to win back Iris' hand and have my fortune restored. And then to live like there was no tomorrow.
   1119516|00000000||And thus I lived until… until I ceased to feel anything at all.
   1119518|00000000||What a joy to be done with it. Because I am done, right? Will you tell me what happened?
   1095154|00000000||So, any better?
   1095156|00000000||Yeah, thanks.
   1119497|00000000||Wine's revived me a bit.
   1095158|00000000||This plonk could revive a corpse. An exquisitely rank vintage.
   1119499|00000000||You know what, though? It's good at last to taste something… real.
   1102423|00000000||Ugh - so, have at it. Tell me what the blazes just happened.
   1126946|00000000||Your brand's gone - guessing that's a good sign?
   1104730|b0682205||Daemon
   1092444|00000000||Figured out at long last what's puttin' the pus in our men's wounds, makin' 'em fester?
   1096370|00000000||An infection.
   1096372|00000000||Care to elaborate, madame medic? Here's a matter of grave concern to the Redanian Army, which I represent.
   1096383|00000000||Septicemia usually begins in the mucous membranes, digestive tract, genitourinary system or simply on the skin.
   1096385|00000000||In this case, we're dealing with a dermal invasion resulting in toxins entering the body.
   1096387|00000000||A, err… wha?
   1096474|00000000||What do scholars look like?
   1096488|00000000||Interesting. Curious to know, what do scholars look like, to your mind?
   1096490|00000000||Err, well, all that readin's hard on the eyes, right? So they wear spectacles.
   1096492|00000000||Oh, aye. Thick ones, propped on wrinkled noses. And their clothin' - frumpy at best.
   1096494|00000000||Who've they got to dress up for? The books?
   1096496|00000000||Fascinating, really. But if I were you, I'd make sure no medic ever overhears you.
   1107570|00000000||Huh? Why's that?
   1107572|00000000||Because when you get cut in a battle, she might just refuse to stitch you back up.
   1092463|00000000||Shani's not my type.
   1113419|00000000||There's no denying her beauty, but… she's not my type.
   1113421|00000000||Bah. Talkin' out your arse, mate.
   1113423|00000000||Passin' on quite the catch. She looked at me like she does you, I'd not dally long thinkin'.
   1107791|00000000||Shani, I need your help this time.
   1107793|00000000||I'd guessed this wasn't a social call. All right, tell me what you need.
   1129222|00000000||Is it at all related to that mark on your face?
   1107795|00000000||Ahh, and you must tell me what happened in the sewers!
   1107878|00000000||I killed a prince and was taken prisoner…
   1107889|00000000||Hm, where do I start…
   1107892|00000000||All right. Monster in the sewers turned out to be a giant toad. And this toad was actually a prince - an Ofieri one, at that.
   1107894|00000000||Mhm. And I'm a Koviri duchess.
   1107896|00000000||It's the truth, uncolored, I swear. When I killed the toad, some Ofieri soldiers led by a mage showed up. Captured me.
   1107898|00000000||Man named Gaunter O'Dimm freed me.
   1108053|00000000||Who's this?
   1108055|00000000||Someone powerful.
   1108060|00000000||Hm. Could be a mage, a demon… or a djinn.
   1108068|00000000||You don't know?
   1108070|00000000||He's very powerful - that's all I need to know.
   1108056|00000000||Don't really know.
   1108058|00000000||Frankly? I don't really know…
   1107902|00000000||He helped me out of a bind. Now he expects me to fulfill some nobleman's wishes in return.
   1107904|00000000||First one's to summon the ghost of his brother, then show him the time of his life.
   1107978|00000000||Amuse a ghost? How do you intend to do that?
   1107980|00000000||Not my chief concern at the moment. Gotta find his grave and summon him, first. Then we'll see.
   1115408|00000000||But that's necromancy! It's extraordinarily risky and involves higher magic.
   1115410|00000000||O'Dimm told me how to do it - no sorceress or necromancy involved.
   1127183|00000000||Gave me this… concoction that summons ghosts. I'll need a censer, too.
   1127185|00000000||That can be arranged. They keep one in a storehouse at the academy. I can fetch it for you.
   1127187|00000000||Thanks.
   1115412|00000000||Don't mention it. But I still don't like this…
   1121438|00000000||Don't whine.
   1121445|00000000||Shani, please. No use complaining. Just help me.
   1121447|00000000||I'm not complaining. I'm concerned.
   1121450|00000000||Oh, fine. So whose ghost is it?
   1107982|00000000||Olgierd von Everec's brother.
   1107986|00000000||Von Everec? Hm.
   1107997|00000000||In my third year at Oxenfurt we had to choose an elective. My options were "Pearls of Wisdom from the Hierarchs" or "Famous Redanian Dynasties."
   1107999|00000000||I chose the latter.
   1107989|00000000||Here it is!
   1107991|00000000||Von Eyegrid… von Esteken… von Everec!
   1107993|00000000||Hmmm. It says Olgierd had a brother named Vlodimir. He lies in the family crypt, near their manor.
   1108001|00000000||Thanks. Knew I could count on you. I'm off.
   1108003|00000000||The crypt's described as quite a work of art. I'd love to see it. Why don't I bring the censer. We can meet at the entrance.
   1121440|00000000||Neither do I. But I don't really have any options. Gotta summon that ghost.
   1121442|00000000||I understand. Whose ghost is it?
   1121437|00000000||Me neither.
   1108062|00000000||Met him a while back in White Orchard. At the time, he claimed he… dealt in mirrors.
   1108064|00000000||Mirrors. Buy one from him that grants your wishes?
   1108066|00000000||Something like that.
   1108054|00000000||A merchant of mirrors.
   1107882|00000000||Long story.
   1107884|00000000||Give me its essence.
   1107886|00000000||The essence? I'm deeply in debt. To a man named Gaunter O'Dimm.
   1107877|00000000||Long story. Waste of words.
   1107672|00000000||Need your help.
   1107674|00000000||Where've you been these past years?
   1107694|00000000||Aside from the incident in the sewers, we last saw each other… hmm… must've been in Vizima.
   1107702|00000000||Uh, yes, yes. When it was ravaged by the Catriona.
   1107696|00000000||Feels like a century ago. Where've you been? What've you been doing since?
   1107709|00000000||Well, I left Vizima and returned to Oxenfurt. Proceeded to finish my doctorate and then opened a practice.
   1107711|00000000||Shortly thereafter, war broke out, and I was press-ganged into the Redanian Medical Corps.
   1121456|00000000||So what now? Radovid's dead.
   1121464|00000000||But the war's not over yet. The chaos continues, I'm still very much needed.
   1121468|00000000||Though I can't complain. At least I live at home, now - and I treat the ill, as is my calling.
   1121454|00000000||Yeah, classic Radovid.
   1121466|00000000||Can't complain, really. I've lived at home since the fighting subsided. Resumed my practice and simply treat the ill.
   1121470|00000000||Though I must always be ready - for at any time the Redanians might knock with some painfully urgent assignment.
   1092470|00000000||Here's the medicine. It's a strong solution, so careful with the dosage. Each patient gets exactly two drops after meals, three times a day. At the most in three, four days, the infection should recede.
   1092472|00000000||I thank you - in Redania's glorious name.
   1092474|00000000||Serving the Redanian cause now?
   1092476|00000000||I serve individuals, I treat them. That they're Redanians is coincidental. I'd help Nilfgaardians as well, were I in a position to.
   1096600|00000000||Kaedwenis, Aedirnian, elves, dwarves, halflings - the same. Come on, Geralt, you know me.
   1113442|00000000||It'd take a blind man to shrug and turn away.
   1113444|00000000||Too true! Meantime, you witchers've got especially sharp senses, heheh.
   1092462|00000000||Shani's a beautiful woman.
   1107573|00000000||Not your business.
   1107578|00000000||Sorry, none of your business.
   1107580|00000000||C'mon! This some kind of secret? You embarrassed?
   1107582|00000000||She's quite fetchin', and you're… well, none too handsome, but a witcher. Lasses like your type.
   1107596|00000000||Come, now. Fess up, you fancy her or not?
   1096498|00000000||You're a lucky bastard, witcher. We've seen her makin' eyes at ye. Nowt like she looks at us. Ain't that right? Admit it… you fancy her, too, eh?
   1096476|00000000||So, think learned women are ugly as a rule?
   1096478|00000000||Well, it's lucky they've brains, 'cause they've not got beauty .
   1096480|00000000||Ain't that right, lads?
   1096482|00000000||Oh, aye! Mutts, all of them.
   1096484|00000000||Hideous things. Wouldn't touch one with a ten-ell pole.
   1096486|00000000||But this lass is different. Exceptional.
   1096473|00000000||Scholars aren't necessarily ugly.
   1092456|00000000||Tasty number, that medic. Not like a scholar at all.
   1092448|00000000||I've tested the slime samples. I believe I'll be able to brew an antidote.
   1092450|00000000||Good. A pox in an army can prove more ravaging than even the fiercest foe. Your service will be recognized.
   1096389|00000000||How? Will I get a toad-shaped medal?
   1096391|00000000||The army's not got any medal like that.
   1096401|00000000||Geralt? Are you all right? What's that on your face?
   1124666|00000000||Long story.
   1092452|00000000||Ahem.
   1096403|00000000||We're conductin' important business. Youse can catch up later.
   1092454|00000000||Uh, yes. Right. I'll get to work on the antidote. Shouldn't take long.
   1137977|00000000||When he found himself witnessing a battle of brothers, Geralt chose to stand by his partner, Ewald, and with their combined strength they defeated Horst and his bodyguards. Ewald then repaid Geralt in the worst possible way: he tried to cheat him by keeping Maximilian's House for himself. Luckily the witcher kept a clear head and, instead of slaughtering Ewald at once, proposed a compromise both sides would find acceptable. Their paths parted soon afterwards, as Ewald left to manage his family fortune and Geralt returned to the Path of a witcher.
   1137978|00000000||When he found himself witnessing a battle of brothers, Geralt chose to stand by his partner, Ewald – and with their combined strength they defeated Horst and his bodyguards. Ewald repaid Geralt in the worst possible way: he tried to cheat him by keeping Maximilian's House for himself. This treachery pushed even the usually level-headed witcher over the edge – his steel sword flew into motion at once and soon Ewald's corpse lay next to that of his hated brother. The tale of the Brothers Borsodi had come to a tragic close.
   1137979|00000000||When he found himself witnessing a battle of brothers, Geralt chose to stand by Horst. Though the elder Borsodi was undeniably arrogant and mean-spirited, he, at least, had not tried to cheat the witcher or use him in a private vendetta as had Ewald. The witcher thus foiled Ewald's years of planning moments before they were to come to fruition, then put an end to Ewald's life as well.
   1139715|00000000||Ewald Borsodi
   1124790|00000000||Living World EP1
   1127505|00000000||Good folk, did you see?! The bloke literally dropped dead!
   1127507|00000000||He were there, alive, a moment ago!
   1128071|00000000||Blind drunk, he was. Maybe he fainted.
   1128073|00000000||Fainted? He's soaked in blood!
   1128075|00000000||Witcher in the house. No wonder folk're droppin', cursed and hexed!
   1093109|00000000||Boot prints, large. A man's, most likely. Hm, thought only women came looking for the cursed prince.
   1093111|00000000||Strange slime…
   1093113|00000000||Slash wounds made by a blade. No monster did this.
   1093142|00000000||Noise coming from the other side of the wall.
   1110741|00000000||Ah, a woman's prints alongside. Single set - she came alone.
   1093115|00000000||Dead drowner. Covered in the same strange slime.
   1093117|00000000||Oh, come on. Please…
   1101984|00000000||They eat 'n drink 'n smoke 'n fight,
   1101986|00000000||And dance with lasses blithe and bonny.
   1101988|00000000||They stomp 'n shout throughout the night,
   1101990|00000000||Singin', "Hey, nonny, nonny!"
   1134635|00000000||You're not him…
   1134638|00000000||Wait. I wanna talk.
   1134640|00000000||Not here, not in this place.
   1112427|00000000||When you placed the sketchbook on my grave, I remembered learning to draw my husband's face.
   1112423|00000000||When you placed the painting on my grave, I remembered the day of my marriage.
   1111662|00000000||He pretends to be happy, but isn't.
   1111686|00000000||Your husband… hunts out ever stronger sensations. He tempts fate. Because at heart he's unhappy.
   1111722|00000000||At heart he is stone. So nothing has changed.
   1111663|00000000||Olgierd's doing all right.
   1111724|00000000||Olgierd's… fine. No ailments, in any case.
   1111726|00000000||Always healthy as an ox, always escaping trouble without a scratch.
   1106297|00000000||I can't take the rose.
   1106303|00000000||I can't take the rose.
   1106361|00000000||Is it not what you came for?
   1106363|00000000||Can't force Iris into… oblivion. She thinks and feels, still. And she's no danger to anyone but intruders.
   1106365|00000000||Look at her, look at her world. She's doomed to relive the painful past eternally. Take the rose, show her mercy.
   1106820|00000000||What should I do? What do you want me to do?
   1106822|00000000||I do not know what I want.
   1106875|00000000||I'm so very, very afraid…
   1106825|00000000||You two, why do you want me to take the rose so badly?
   1106827|00000000||You two - you want me to take the rose, trying to convince me. Why?
   1106830|00000000||We want to help Iris von Everec. And you.
   1106831|00000000||Generous demons? I don't buy it. Because you are demons, right?
   1106833|00000000||You were to serve Iris until the end of her days. End didn't come with her death, so you were sentenced to stay in the world of her torment for all time.
   1106835|00000000||Can't break the contract yourselves, so you need me to do it for you. If I take the rose, Iris'll cease to exist, but you'll also be freed.
   1106837|00000000||You're right. But are we wrong to want that? Our intentions are pure.
   1106839|00000000||We're but bit players in this tragedy, a performance that's gone on too long. We can't help the mistress, and her fate no longer moves us.
   1106877|00000000||Can we be blamed for simply wanting to leave the stage?
   1140107|00000000||Painting's changed. Got the violet rose there now.
   1140109|00000000||And Iris, ready to see her husband again.
   1106860|00000000||I won't decide your fate. I can't accept the rose.
   1106862|00000000||Will you leave empty-handed? What about your task?
   1106864|00000000||Rose stays with Iris.
   1106866|00000000||So that is how it's to be. Perhaps in the years to come another will appear to free us.
   1106868|00000000||I don't know that you've chosen wisely. And though I feel no gratitude, I'll not send you away empty-handed.
   1106870|00000000||Look, the petal edges darken. The flower closes, and I am overcome with sleep.
   1106880|00000000||Goodnight, stranger. You must leave. The rose awaits outside this world. While I… I descend once more into my dream of what was.
   1106882|00000000||Olgierd, I wish to be with Olgierd. To gaze again into those eyes, eyes the devil would be proud to have.
   1106884|00000000||Farewell.
   1106824|00000000||Not my place to decide Iris' fate. I won't take the rose.
   1106823|00000000||This needs to end. I'm taking the rose.
   1106355|00000000||I need the rose. Will you give it to me?
   1106841|00000000||It's so fragile… Look, the petal edges have turned crimson. As they were on the day I received it.
   1106843|00000000||The one thing missing is the single drop of dew which slid down the leaf when I took the rose in hand. Or was it blood - because I'd pricked my finger? I can't remember.
   1106845|00000000||You know, I never did read the letter from Olgierd. I didn't have to. And I needn't have kept the flower he left me.
   1106847|00000000||I've come to a decision - I shall give you the rose.
   1106852|00000000||Our service thus ends. Thank you, stranger, for freeing us.
   1106854|00000000||Before we go, some advice - beware of the one called the Man of Glass. Stand in his way, and you'll meet a fate worse than death. Seek salvation in glass that can't be broken.
   1112499|00000000||Glass that can't be broken?
   1112501|00000000||So long.
   1106856|00000000||I'll remember you, Iris von Everec.
   1106858|00000000||That no longer matters. Farewell.
   1106296|00000000||Can you give me the rose?
   1106298|00000000||The rose - more than a memento, isn't it?
   1106300|00000000||Got a feeling the rose is important to you, more than a memento.
   1106328|00000000||I remember so little… Yet when I think of my rose, I begin to recall what was.
   1106330|00000000||The world around me turns real. And I-- My eyes open wide and I recognize things, remember who I am and who I was.
   1106349|00000000||Friend once told me about a case like this. Could be strong emotions that bind you to the rose, feelings we witchers call "pins." They're what keeps you in this world.
   1106351|00000000||Like an insect pinned in a collection case? Horrible.
   1106353|00000000||Need to be honest. If I take the rose, you might cease to exist, as might the world you've built around you.
   1106357|00000000||And what will happen then? Shall I be free of the suffering, the sadness? Is it the void that awaits?
   1106359|00000000||I don't know.
   1128623|00000000||I don't wish to suffer any longer… but I fear there will be cold and darkness, until… there is nothing at all.
   1111774|00000000||And did… did Olgierd mention me? What did he say?
   1111777|00000000||Not much, but I didn't ask about you. He just sent me to retrieve the rose.
   1111780|00000000||The rose? The last I have left of him? His last gift.
   1111666|00000000||Shouldn't worry about him at all. He's no longer the man you loved.
   1111668|00000000||So his heart remains hardened.
   1111661|00000000||Olgierd doesn't deserve your concern.
   1111664|00000000||Your husband has a powerful enemy.
   1111761|00000000||Your husband's got a powerful enemy. Gaunter O'Dimm - know the name?
   1111763|00000000||I curse the day I first heard it.
   1111765|00000000||Who is he? And how'd he step into your lives?
   1111767|00000000||It's my fault. It was for me Olgierd summoned the Man of Glass. And it was my fault he wished for riches, then immortality for us both…
   1111769|00000000||Olgierd will best O'Dimm, won't he? Now tell me - how is my husband?
   1112455|00000000||Tell me, how is Olgierd? Healthy? Does he fare well?
   1112452|00000000||When you placed the hairbrush on my grave, I remembered brushing my hair while Olgierd watched in silence.
   1106284|00000000||I've come for the violet rose Olgierd gave you--
   1106286|00000000||On the day we saw one another for the last time. I dried it and placed it in our chamber. At my bedside.
   1131919|00000000||I lay there for days, staring at it, until at last it crumbled into dust. As did I, soon after.
   1106288|00000000||So… the rose is gone?
   1106290|00000000||Not from this world. Look. You buried my body, and the flower's bloomed once more.
   1106293|00000000||And I… I was held in a deep, dark sleep. Only now have I awoken. Just like my beautiful rose.
   1130628|00000000||I've come for the rose Olgierd gave you.
   1130629|00000000||We've met before.
   1106942|00000000||Saw you before, but you weren't yourself-- Then I saw you again in your memories.
   1106944|00000000||We've met? I don't recall…
   1106946|00000000||I had bad dreams - that is all I know.
   1106153|00000000||I'm sorry. I mistook you for another.
   1111654|00000000||For Olgierd?
   1106155|00000000||I thought he'd returned. To me.
   1106157|00000000||What are you? A ghost? An illusion?
   1106159|00000000||I am sadness.
   1129276|00000000||The memory's blurred.
   1130396|00000000||You must search for a way to restore it, complete it.
   1131236|00000000||Ah, dammit all.
   1115761|00000000||Tattered decorations for a special occasion.
   1122656|00000000||Olgierd and his wife? Look frozen mid-motion.
   1126451|00000000||One of her memories.
   1126465|00000000||It is blurred, incomplete. You must restore it.
   1115766|00000000||Hm? Medallion's humming…
   1115769|00000000||A wraith…?
   1119379|00000000||No. A nightmare.
   1119381|00000000||A fear crystallized. One you must now face.
   1130622|00000000||A wedding veil?
   1115763|00000000||Same figure.
   1119383|00000000||You'll see more of them.
   1093202|00000000||Your health, my dear wife.
   1101786|00000000||And yours, my husband.
   1126524|00000000||In my land, custom calls that newlyweds be greeted with bread and salt. But we're alone for now.
   1101790|00000000||I need none but you. Ah, if only this moment could last forever.
   1103953|00000000||I shall see what I can do. But come in and see our home.
   1116113|00000000||Gladly, but… I know this sounds silly… yet the house has sat empty for so long, and I'm…
   1126526|00000000||Afraid of spiders, I know, I know. I swept them all up and tossed them in the garden.
   1131207|00000000||My knight… you've seen to everything.
   1115842|00000000||Wine cup. Just like the one Olgierd's holding.
   1093985|00000000||I won't even think on the coin we lost on that fire eater.
   1101794|00000000||She's my only daughter, shan't begrudge her any expense.
   1101796|00000000||Oh, it would've been perfect! Damned mutt!
   1093987|00000000||That woman'll lament my head off if no one finds that juggler.
   1105492|00000000||You needn't worry. The witcher - that is, I - will find this swallower of heated things.
   1105494|00000000||Oh, mighty generous offer, but no one knows where to look.
   1105496|00000000||Matters not. Witchers-- that is, we have our ways. The flame gulper, what did he look like?
   1105498|00000000||He wore a jester's cap, typical sort. Ought to be enough to identify him.
   1105505|00000000||I shall find him.
   1110573|00000000||We thank you. And hope for the best.
   1116484|00000000||Agh, awfully nice of you to offer your help, but are you sure you're up to it? You're not actually a witcher, Vlodimir.
   1110576|00000000||I wish to find this magician. Give it a go, all right? But you cannot help me. I must do it alone - I expect it will be great fun.
   1116487|00000000||Ugh. Fine. Don't have to do this, but if I were you, I'd find the dog's tracks, follow its trail. Just a thought.
   1116498|00000000||Excellent advice. I'll take it!
   1116489|00000000||Shani, Vlodimir and I need to find the fire eater. If we're not back by midnight, then…
   1110578|00000000||Relax. You'll be back in no time. I believe in you.
   1116491|00000000||Tally-ho! Adventure awaits!
   1105483|00000000||I shall find him.
   1105484|00000000||Tell me everything you know.
   1110554|00000000||Before I can begin my witcherly investigation, I require guidance, clues. Tell me all you know. Everything.
   1105507|00000000||Well, the fire eater arrived around noon. Ate his fill, of food not fire, then went for a stroll, to air some gasses, he said. That horror Daemon saw him and started barking like a thing possessed.
   1105509|00000000||Why so?
   1105511|00000000||Haven't a clue. Didn't like the man, sensed something awry. Perhaps that the man swallowed fire - animals fear fire.
   1110556|00000000||If afeared, it would have fled, not given chase.
   1110558|00000000||Damn fool dog - how can you know? But it snapped its chain and chased the fire eater into the woods.
   1110560|00000000||Foolish or not, it's our son-in-law's beloved pet. There'll be hell to pay if it goes missin'.
   1101758|00000000||Do you need help?
   1101760|00000000||Shani, darling… Oh, you shan't believe what's happened. I'm marrying off my only daughter. Wanted a proper wedding for her, wild revelry. So I hired a true fire eater - you know, whoosh, gulp, sizzle, sizzle.
   1101762|00000000||Oooh, I've not seen that sort of trickery.
   1101764|00000000||Horribly dear, diversions of that sort. He'd journeyed here from Novigrad.
   1101766|00000000||But I'll not squeeze coppers on my daughter, oh no. The groom's family have us for paupers, but we'll show them how wrong they are.
   1101768|00000000||Seems we won't, in fact, for our fire swallower's as gone as last Yule's puddin'.
   1093899|00000000||Groom's hound chased him off! That blasted Daemon. Hrmph, they sure named it right!
   1116482|00000000||Calm yourself, dumplin'. Master witcher's here now, perhaps he can aid us.
   1124664|00000000||How? The man's got ass ears. He should first seek to help himself.
   1126601|00000000||Such ears might be high fashion in his parts…
   1126605|00000000||Oh, I doubt that…
   1093957|00000000||He arrived, that's certain - I saw him myself.
   1101776|00000000||So if he arrived, why's he not here now?
   1101778|00000000||The bloody dog chased him away!
   1093959|00000000||Daemon?
   1101780|00000000||None other! Hideous mutt.
   1101782|00000000||Oh, bother… means we're missin' a fire eater and a dog…
   1107332|00000000||A missing hound, it seems. Perhaps we can be of service. My first witcherly investigation - I've goose pimples!
   1106643|00000000||So much coin, all for naught. I do hope the mutant can find the fire eater.
   1107236|00000000||And I hope he finds Daemon. A quarrel with the in-laws? Wouldn't want that.
   1107238|00000000||The fire eater will prove us a decent family. A family that throws a proper wedding - can afford it!
   1106647|00000000||Stop your grievin'. Mutant like that's made to hunt beasts, track down the missin'. He'll dig him up.
   1096410|00000000||No idea.
   1096412|00000000||Hm. Gotta admit - haven't the foggiest.
   1096414|00000000||You needn't have said it. Your crude-looking mug, as you put it, radiates ignorance. I bid you adieu.
   1094317|00000000||Not a bit, and I don't much care to learn.
   1094335|00000000||No. I'm more interested in the culinary arts, too.
   1094337|00000000||Why stand near me, then? You ought to be hovering about the buffet.
   1096409|00000000||[Indicate the battle scene.]
   1096428|00000000||The battle piece, if I'm not mistaken.
   1096430|00000000||You err. Deeply. I bid you adieu.
   1096408|00000000||[Indicate the still life.]
   1096424|00000000||Hm, the still life?
   1096426|00000000||Of course not. That's a Longendijk. The palette, the brushwork… Obvious from a mile away! Adieu.
   1096406|00000000||[Indicate the view of Novigrad.]
   1096420|00000000||The panorama of Novigrad, I'd say.
   1096422|00000000||Pff. There's not a bumpkin who does not know van der Knoob never ventured outside Maribor. Adieu.
   1096432|00000000||What a jackass.
   1096434|00000000||Ah, fuck him. Typical aristocunt. I've grown accustomed.
   1096416|00000000||Hm, the pastoral scene, I think.
   1096418|00000000||Incorrect. But I suppose I might've expected your gaze to look homewards to the country… Adieu.
   1096405|00000000||[Indicate the pastoral.]
   1096472|00000000||Nothin' special.
   1096554|00000000||Ah, nothing special.
   1096556|00000000||Truly? Hm. Shame, that.
   1096558|00000000||All right. Let's go. Ink spot upon ink spot - sheer number of them's doin' my heid in!
   1096550|00000000||To buy the van Rogh. Apparently, this bookseller in Novigrad's willing to pay top coin for his work.
   1096552|00000000||Oh? Who'd 'ave thunk.
   1096471|00000000||To buy the van Rogh.
   1096442|00000000||Ugh, really? Merchant with the pearl, no two ways about it.
   1096444|00000000||My, my. Who would have thought? Hm, might I have a word in private?
   1096461|00000000||Forgive me my impertinence. At first I thought you an ignoramus, Vivaldi's equal.
   1096463|00000000||I feel I should apologize and atone, so I shall tell you a secret. A van Rogh is due to appear on the block. The painter's unknown, largely, but has a fierce admirer in Marcus Hodgson, a bookseller, has his shop in Novigrad's main square. I wager you'll sell him the canvas at a tidy profit.
   1096465|00000000||Thanks.
   1096467|00000000||Think nothing of it. Now please excuse me. My friends beckon.
   1096470|00000000||So? What did he tell ye?
   1096407|00000000||[Indicate the portrait of the merchant.]
   1094316|00000000||Realize this might be hard to believe, given my crude-looking mug, but yeah - I know a thing or two.
   1094319|00000000||Truly? We ought to see what.
   1094323|00000000||Do you know our friend Vivaldi is in possession of five canvasses by van der Knoob? Yet he cannot distinguish them from landscapes at five crowns apiece.
   1094325|00000000||I shan't pretend it's otherwise.
   1094327|00000000||Yet for you, my dear connoisseur witcher, that should present not the slightest problem. So do tell, which of these is the handiwork of Edward van der Knoob, the master from Maribor?
   1094313|00000000||A bit.
   1094306|00000000||Yaromir? Might we trouble ye a wee spell?
   1094308|00000000||Mhm. Greetings, Vivaldi. Who's this?
   1094310|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. Witcher.
   1094312|00000000||Thought ye might have a blether with us. Aboot the paintin's on the block today. Hm?
   1096362|00000000||Ah, sniffing for a quick turnaround as usual, are we?
   1096364|00000000||Pot callin' the kettle black, I'd say. Do a lively trade in canvasses yerself, my friend.
   1096366|00000000||True. Yet first they delight my eyes. Whereas you treat them as mere promissory notes. The only arts that interest you are those culinary.
   1096368|00000000||What about you, witcher? Do you know anything about paintings?
   1096560|00000000||Not now, witcher.
   1093808|00000000||Column seven, row twenty - you've an error.
   1093810|00000000||By golly, indeed. The decimal belongs after the seven. Hm, shame you caught it.
   1093812|00000000||You've prepared the schedule of outlays?
   1093814|00000000||Of course. In duplicate.
   1093804|00000000||Babergé Egg - white gold and mother of pearl with topaz insets. Sold to Madame Villepin.
   1093806|00000000||Dress of Haaki silk trimmed with amethyst beads. I've a starting price of two thousand crowns.
   1137755|00000000||Tasked with finding the violet rose Olgierd had given his wife, Geralt traveled to the von Everec family's abandoned estate, which had become home to a host of strange and horrifying creatures. Among these were a black cat and dog who, though able to speak, chose to say very little about themselves. Geralt surmised they were demons from another sphere who had been summoned by black magic, trapped in animal bodies and bound to serve Iris von Everec. The enigmatic duo trusted Geralt would help them regain their lost freedom, even though he himself had no idea how he might go about doing such a thing.<br>
   1137756|00000000||Later, when Geralt encountered Iris von Everec's memories, he learned Olgierd had summoned the otherworldly dog and cat to keep his wife company in his absence – an idea only a man with a heart of stone could have imagined working. The two creatures remained loyal to Iris even after she died and transformed into an enraged ghost, but they never loved her and felt no sympathy for her fate, for such feelings did not form a part of their nature and did not reside in even the darkest corners of their souls.<br>
   1137757|00000000||In the end the strange dog and cat regained their longed-for freedom when Iris von Everec gave Geralt the violet rose, thereby ending her existence. With their lady gone, the dog and cat's service ended, and they were free again at long last.
   1137758|00000000||In the end the strange dog and cat did not regain the freedom they craved. Geralt refused to cause Iris von Everec to cease existing, meaning these creatures would continue in her service, for such was the nature of the pact they had made with Olgierd. Perhaps they still keep their lady company in her dreams to this day – no man can know for sure.
   1137754|00000000||The Black Cat and Dog
   1130690|00000000||Yes, Geralt?
   1136510|00000000||You know, been wanting to ask you something…
   1136512|00000000||Ask me now.
   1137396|00000000||Just… curious. You ever play gwent?
   1137398|00000000||Oh, Geralt, Geralt… Of course I play. What else is there to do come evening when one's among soldiers?
   1137400|00000000||Come on, let's lay them out.
   1136514|00000000||Care for a round of gwent?
   1136516|00000000||I should think so!
   1136508|00000000||Care for a game of gwent?
   1134325|00000000||Came by after I… escaped from Ofieri ship. Must've just missed you.
   1134327|00000000||My commanders summoned me. Interrogated me about the sewers, what happened there.
   1134598|00000000||Interrogated?
   1134600|00000000||Had some questions. I went down there with a whole unit. Only I came out alive, they wanted to know why.
   1134602|00000000||What'd you say?
   1134604|00000000||What could I say? Sewers're are swarming with drowners, soldiers died as heroes protecting me. All of which is true.
   1134606|00000000||Captain sent me off to test the samples I'd collected, then ordered the sewers locked down.
   1134608|00000000||That's good, at least.
   1134307|00000000||Came by earlier. You were out.
   1130770|00000000||You mean after you left Vizima with Triss? Hmm…
   1130692|00000000||Well, the peace was brief, but I used it well. Went back to Oxenfurt, completed my doctorate. Then I believe I did time in every field hospital and medic's tent north of the Yaruga.
   1130694|00000000||Never could stand to be idle.
   1130696|00000000||I'm not a witcher, not likely to live a hundred and fifty years. My time's much shorter, so I try to use every bit wisely.
   1130698|00000000||Always did know what you wanted.
   1130700|00000000||True. Nothing's changed in that sense.
   1130768|00000000||After… our paths diverged? Hmm…
   1130298|00000000||Finally, some time to talk. Tell me where you've been, what you've done - since you left Vizima.
   1106939|00000000||These last years - where've you been, what've you done?
   1130321|00000000||See you later.
   1102944|00000000||Farewell.
   1096833|00000000||Aldona and Johnnus - a lovely wedding.
   1130723|00000000||Gotta say, wedding was a great idea. Rarely have a chance to rest, get away from it all. Did me good to do just that.
   1130725|00000000||I'm a medic. I tend to know what I'm doing when I prescribe something.
   1130727|00000000||Hope Vlodimir's antics weren't too annoying.
   1130729|00000000||A… peculiar man, ghost - true. But I found him… likeable. Wager he was a real hoot when he was alive.
   1130719|00000000||You're right… but… promise to share a bottle of wine with me from time to time?
   1130721|00000000||Of course! Tell you what - I'll keep one handy.
   1130766|00000000||Ah, besides, we tried once… and you know how that worked out.
   1102959|00000000||Said you needed to think things over. Have you?
   1102961|00000000||Yes. I decided you're incredibly sweet, but--
   1130715|00000000||But we're better off keeping things as they were?
   1130717|00000000||Mhm. You're always going places, and they're likely to ship me off soon…
   1102955|00000000||Should do it again some time. Except, with no ghost possessing my body.
   1102957|00000000||I'd be glad to.
   1136530|00000000||You lost. My, you actually stink at this. Worse than an enema tube, in fact..
   1137402|00000000||Need to demand satisfaction for that insult. We'll have to play again.
   1136528|00000000||You're good. So good I'd say you spend more time chatting up folk for games, than you do on serious matters.
   1137404|00000000||Naaa, got lucky, that's all.
   1137406|00000000||Mhm, likely. But here - an, I daresay, formidable card from an old friend… so you won't have to rely entirely on luck.
   1139677|00000000||<i>The girl walked up to the edge of the pond. There, squatting amidst the fragrant lilies and broad lily-pads, she saw a most unusual sight: a small green frog with a golden crown perched on its warty head. Charmed by this curious little creature, the girl picked it up and gave it a kiss. Immediately the little frog transformed into a handsome prince. Overcome with gratitude, he asked the girl to be his wife.</i><br>– folk tale, author unknown<br><br>Timeless tales always carry within them a grain of truth. The legend of the frog prince is no exception, or at least that’s what the folk of Oxenfurt wished to believe when they found out a monstrous toad lurked in their city sewers. The women who hunted it in search of romance and a better life, however, found their tales had a most unhappy ending. The creature they encountered was no small, sweet frog but a bloodthirsty beast, who not only did not let them in for a kiss, but instead greedily devoured them and anything else that strayed into its slime-covered lair.
   1139676|00000000||The Toad Prince
   1106901|00000000||Hahah! Come on, Zorin, stop being a nancy!
   1106899|00000000||Hahahaha! Go on, give it to him!
   1127230|00000000||Greetings.
   1127232|00000000||Greetings, and praise the world in its never-ending creation.
   1127234|00000000||Don't take this the wrong way, but, honestly, world doesn't deserve much praise.
   1127236|00000000||Ehh, Nordlings. Hm. Disagreeable always, faces crinkled, soured, ready to quibble to death even a simple greeting.
   1129894|00000000||Aha! But my tongue now has soured, while you for trade have come. Sadly, I can forge for you nothing - my belongings, tools inclusive, all lost.
   1129895|00000000||Your trade - what exactly is it?
   1129910|00000000||You a craftsman or a mage?
   1129912|00000000||Your tongue has no word to fit my trade. A scholar and artisan I am, part craftsman, part mage.
   1129916|00000000||Gematria, runecraft - familiar to you are these words?
   1129918|00000000||No. Runecraft seems pretty self-explanatory, though.
   1129925|00000000||True, though my craft further ventures. Runes and glyphs I first make, then arrange into powerful magic words.
   1130035|00000000||Great practical applications has my art. For runestones properly forged, in a sword set so as to form a magic word, the blade more power grant than runestones set haphazardly.
   1130070|00000000||Such words too can of glyphs be made and set in armor.
   1129908|00000000||Lemme help you recover what you lost.
   1129927|00000000||Listen, folk sometimes hire me to solve their problems. Even retrieved a missing item or two in my time.
   1129929|00000000||For me, this you cannot do. I sailed upon a great ship. It sank, and my instruments took to the sea's dark depths.
   1129931|00000000||Buying replacements not an option?
   1129933|00000000||Of my own design they were, specially forged. A fortune it cost to make them. And all the coin that with me I had brought lies now in the murky abyss with my instruments.
   1129907|00000000||Might be able to help each other.
   1129934|00000000||Seems your skills could be useful to me. Given that, I'd be happy to help you out.
   1129936|00000000||What do you say I get you the coin you need? Could pay me back in runes and glyphs.
   1129938|00000000||Is it certain your offer? A great sum I require. Tools of great expense I need to make even the simplest glyph. I make no mention of the more advanced or master-crafted.
   1129940|00000000||Rest easy. Got a feeling this'll be a good investment.
   1127250|00000000||Got some coin on me. This enough?
   1127252|00000000||A… start it is.
   1127254|00000000||Costly craft.
   1127256|00000000||Yet the costs do not end with coin. Need I shall also a jade stone of size substantial.
   1127615|00000000||Hm, see what I can do.
   1127213|00000000||Got some coin for you.
   1127244|00000000||Way you talk about your art, sound more like a man of faith than scholarship.
   1127246|00000000||Faith and scholarship for you lie in conflict. Yet in my land, holy men are scholars, wisdom their source of esteem.
   1130140|00000000||The Ofieri believe in any gods?
   1130142|00000000||From region to region this varies. Raised I was to believe in one God - the world. Hm. Symbols are God's speech, to study His words is to draw nearer to Him.
   1127248|00000000||Symbols - meaning runes and glyphs.
   1130144|00000000||Mere signs are these - an attempt by men imperfect to describe the world. Yet a magic to them there is, and from God all magic issues.
   1130146|00000000||When runes I create, when into words I arrange them - this is prayer. And when into swords I enchant them, that is my benediction.
   1127215|00000000||Your art - talk about like it's a religion.
   1127216|00000000||Farewell.
   1127214|00000000||What brought you to our lands?
   1127240|00000000||Can't help but wonder what brings you to our lands.
   1127242|00000000||A simple thing - for knowledge a thirst. All he could my mentor had taught me. The tongues of our lands I'd learned, of all our plants and animals I know the names.
   1130129|00000000||Risked that long a journey to learn new words?
   1130130|00000000||A life of plenty I would have lived at home, for the beauty and import of my art are respected. But such a life would be unfulfilled.
   1130132|00000000||Great and diverse is the world, for apace continues its creation. A riddle it is which through symbols speaks.
   1130134|00000000||The world's tongue to learn I wish. The signs by which it speaks to discover, their syntax to master. Through this to learn the principles of creation.
   1117641|00000000||Track's are clear. Lead into the woods.
   1117643|00000000||Mhm. "This little piggy ate raw and steaming human flesh…"
   1117639|00000000||Bolt between its ribs. It was being hunted. Something went horribly wrong, though.
   1117637|00000000||Shit.
   1125411|00000000||Ugh. Humans.
   1048438|cb8e3ab1||Horse
   1116971|00000000||Smile, Shani.
   1116973|00000000||You brought me… chamomile?
   1116975|00000000||Not a girl out there doesn't like flowers, right?
   1116977|00000000||Can't speak for other girls, but chamomile is tea to me. Thanks, maybe I'll boil them tomorrow morning.
   1113416|00000000||Brought you some mead. Best medicine for a troubled soul.
   1114116|00000000||Thanks.
   1113414|00000000||Seemed to like the rowan. Thought you might want to try another form of it.
   1114114|00000000||I liked to make necklaces out of the berries, but… guess I am curious how this will taste.
   1116980|00000000||Wedding's still in full swing, but your face - I'd say you were at a funeral. Why so sad?
   1116982|00000000||Sad? Not really. It's just, after I caught the garland I realized something.
   1116984|00000000||The years're flying by, yet all I ever do is study, pump stomachs, and reattach limbs. All alone.
   1116986|00000000||You've got friends.
   1117017|00000000||You've got friends. Me, for one.
   1117019|00000000||In that case, let's drink to our friendship.
   1117021|00000000||To friendship.
   1114133|00000000||His will, sure, but my body. Felt everything. Reminded me of the old times.
   1117078|00000000||Uh, Vizima, you mean? Oh, I thought you'd forgotten our whole Catriona story.
   1102807|00000000||It was all right.
   1102819|00000000||Not half bad. Might've even enjoyed myself if I hadn't had to argue with a madman's ghost, be his puppet.
   1102821|00000000||Gotta admit, though - thanks to him I did experience a lot of things I might've missed otherwise.
   1102823|00000000||Mean chasing a dog through the woods, or brawling fence board in hand?
   1102825|00000000||Forgetting something. There was also a kiss.
   1117098|00000000||True. Though that was so clearly Vlodimir, I nearly forgot you were involved at all.
   1114120|00000000||Kinda like Vizima - remember? You, me, Zoltan, Dandelion, endless drinking binges…
   1114123|00000000||And the Catriona plague.
   1117111|00000000||That was background. What I remember most - the mood, the feelings, the people I met… and those I met for the second time in my life.
   1117113|00000000||You're right. I was up to my elbows in work, but those were good times. They're nice memories.
   1117115|00000000||For me, too.
   1114201|00000000||Seems the families are bonding.
   1114203|00000000||A bride's father and his son-in-law? Stiff at first, but add drink and they bond or slap each other silly.
   1114205|00000000||I was afraid the wedding wouldn't happen at all.
   1114207|00000000||Mean the differences in wealth?
   1114209|00000000||Mhm. Johnnus' family didn't consider Aldona worthy.
   1117119|00000000||Clear they love each other, though. Parents usually give in if that's the case.
   1117121|00000000||Oh, I don't know. My mother would never accept an "unfit" beau. Even if I insisted I loved him, had chosen him.
   1117123|00000000||You'd convince her, I'm sure.
   1117134|00000000||Doubt your mother's that unbending. You'd win her over, I'm sure.
   1117136|00000000||I haven't managed to yet.
   1117181|00000000||That was Vlodimir, not me.
   1117183|00000000||That was Vlodimir, not me. Remember.
   1117185|00000000||But pretend for a moment it had been you. And the situation had been different.
   1117187|00000000||Say you're at the wedding, and that very girl keeps glancing, smiling at you. Then she finally walks up, and you know exactly what she wants.
   1117189|00000000||What do you do?
   1102977|00000000||Would've survived, somehow.
   1102992|00000000||I couldn't have done anything, sadly, but somehow, I think I would've survived.
   1102994|00000000||I think so, too. I imagine you've lived through worse than a tryst in a barn with some milkmaid.
   1102996|00000000||Definitely. A tryst in a barn would be a much more pleasant experience than a fight in a manticore's den.
   1119299|00000000||Completely different.
   1119295|00000000||Honestly? Completely different.
   1119297|00000000||Better or worse?
   1119291|00000000||Just… impossible to compare.
   1119293|00000000||Just different.
   1119292|00000000||Better.
   1119317|00000000||Definitely prefer kissing you without Vlodimir's help.
   1119319|00000000||Not going back, but not about to waste any time, either. Gonna use every minute wisely.
   1132055|00000000||To yourself, either.
   1132057|00000000||You're right. I shouldn't mix.
   1132060|00000000||I hope they don't see you drinking their wine.
   1132062|00000000||Got their hands full at the moment.
   1132064|00000000||Uh, they could finish quicker than you think. Catch you with your hands full.
   1132066|00000000||Let's hide.
   1132052|00000000||You probably shouldn't mix.
   1132053|00000000||You're right, let's empty it.
   1132068|00000000||You're the medic. Recommendation?
   1132071|00000000||Hey, leave some for me.
   1132073|00000000||We need to drink fast. Before they catch us.
   1132079|00000000||Come on, let's hide.
   1119315|00000000||Let's go back.
   1119375|00000000||Love to stay, I would. But we oughta get back to the wedding.
   1119377|00000000||Yes… yes, that's best.
   1119366|00000000||Penny for your thoughts?
   1119368|00000000||Just thinking that friends should stay friends.
   1119370|00000000||Mhm. My feeling, too.
   1119372|00000000||I have a lot to think about. Alone. So, I'm not going back to the wedding. Not really fond of watching drunks stagger around, anyway.
   1119347|00000000||Shani, wait!
   1119350|00000000||Before you go… need to ask you a favor.
   1119352|00000000||Yes?
   1119354|00000000||It's about Olgierd. Seems a mysterious man. Can't escape the impression his story's more complicated than I thought.
   1119356|00000000||Could you look into it? See if you can learn something?
   1119358|00000000||Sure, be glad to.
   1119360|00000000||Thanks. Be seeing you.
   1119362|00000000||Yes, see you later, Geralt.
   1119329|00000000||Awake already?
   1119331|00000000||For a while now. Did you know you've gained twenty-seven new scars since we last saw each other?
   1130277|00000000||Keeping count?
   1130279|00000000||Hm… I do that sometimes.
   1119334|00000000||Did we make it to the Moon?
   1119336|00000000||Forgotten already?
   1119338|00000000||Nah. Not the sort of thing you forget.
   1119340|00000000||Exactly…
   1119342|00000000||Sound like you wish you could.
   1119344|00000000||No. Certainly won't forget that, and I definitely don't regret it. But I do need to sort it all out in my head. Alone.
   1132095|00000000||Sorry…
   1132097|00000000||Was it that bad? Or have you developed an allergy for me?
   1132099|00000000||Had too much to drink.
   1132081|00000000||Row me to the Moon.
   1132084|00000000||Gotta fly to get to the Moon.
   1132086|00000000||You're dead wrong. Look, it's right there! In the middle of the lake!
   1132089|00000000||What're you doing?
   1132091|00000000||What one usually does on the Moon.
   1132035|00000000||Rats, pier's taken…
   1132037|00000000||Got a feeling it's about to free up.
   1132040|00000000||How did you know...?
   1132042|00000000||I'm clairvoyant.
   1132045|00000000||Mh, practically full…
   1132047|00000000||Be a shame to let it go to waste.
   1132049|00000000||Besides, we leave it here, a very drunk person could find it - drink themselves into even more trouble.
   1132051|00000000||And I swore a solemn oath - “First of all, do no harm.”
   1119321|00000000||And I aim to be direct, even more so than Vlodimir.
   1119323|00000000||Sounds interesting.
   1119325|00000000||Interesting is what interesting does.
   1119364|00000000||Promised you this night. Aim to keep my word.
   1119314|00000000||Kiss sure didn't sate me.
   1119306|00000000||Correct me if I'm wrong, but I do believe Vlodimir was after more than a kiss. Said so openly, in fact.
   1119308|00000000||Mh, all true. He was very direct, I'll give him that. Which on occasion has its advantages…
   1119310|00000000||You're right. Can save a lot of time.
   1119313|00000000||So how do you stand today, Geralt? Have some time to waste with me, or would you rather go back now?
   1119304|00000000||Definitely rather kiss you alone, of my own free will.
   1119298|00000000||Better by a mile.
   1119302|00000000||So, how'd it compare?
   1114212|00000000||Ooh. Gorgeous.
   1114214|00000000||Been thinking about that kiss.
   1114216|00000000||What kiss?
   1114218|00000000||The one Vlodimir planted on your lips… with my lips. Just wondering if it would've felt any different without him there.
   1114220|00000000||That I cannot tell you.
   1114222|00000000||Only one way to find out.
   1117201|00000000||Hmm. Put it that way, and I guess I don't really have a choice.
   1117203|00000000||A witcher never lets an opportunity pass, is that it?
   1117246|00000000||No. He does… if he spots a better one nearby.
   1117191|00000000||I go with her.
   1117190|00000000||Let her down easy. I prefer you.
   1117193|00000000||Hmm. If Dandelion was around, and he usually is, I'd introduce her to him and walk off.
   1117195|00000000||I don't believe that. You'd let the opportunity pass?
   1102984|00000000||I don't need opportunities like that.
   1102986|00000000||Changed your style?
   1114186|00000000||Let's say I've grown choosy.
   1114188|00000000||You say that as if you've already picked.
   1114190|00000000||Cause I have. Guess who?
   1117197|00000000||I wasn't in the mood. Would've resisted, tried to regain control.
   1117199|00000000||I think you would've seized the opportunity.
   1102976|00000000||I prefer you.
   1102929|00000000||Look. The brave brothers.
   1102931|00000000||Drank themselves stiff as the boards they tore from the fence.
   1102933|00000000||Wonder where the sister is. Couldn't protect her from a cheeky four year old in their condition.
   1102935|00000000||If they hadn't intervened, you'd have gone for tumble in the hay with her. She was willing, if you ask me.
   1117158|00000000||You only ever bring home fiddlers, jugglers and witchers?
   1117160|00000000||Hahaha. No. But she'd want me to choose someone wealthy, or with a good trade, well brought up.
   1117162|00000000||Nothing wrong with that, is there?
   1117164|00000000||Uh, I guess not. But it's hard to find one like that who's still even slightly amusing.
   1117166|00000000||That's probably true.
   1117168|00000000||Tell that to my mother. She actually thinks I should've found a husband at the Academy.
   1117172|00000000||But I didn't. Ugh, I'm certain she thinks there's something horribly wrong with me.
   1117170|00000000||Oh please, Shani.
   1117174|00000000||It's the thirteenth century. Women don't go to the Academy to find a husband. They go to learn, pursue their passion. You did that. I'm sure your mother appreciates it.
   1117176|00000000||You got a doctorate, have your own practice, been at the front lines many times. You're a good person. Not a thing wrong with you.
   1117178|00000000||Really think so?
   1117180|00000000||Really.
   1117128|00000000||What kind of beau's "unfit"?
   1117130|00000000||Ah, so far, every kind.
   1117122|00000000||"Unfit" - what's that mean?
   1114192|00000000||You needn't worry about our finances, sir. My workshop? Business is boomin'.
   1114194|00000000||Good, I'm relieved to hear it. See, coin's tight at our end. But don't tell the old battleaxe. She'd be furious if she learnt I let it slip.
   1114196|00000000||Never you worry, sir. My lips're sealed as the grave. Us menfolk need to stick together.
   1117117|00000000||"Sir," "sir!" Hahah, enough o' that! I'm Vassy. But you can call me "da."
   1114198|00000000||Oh, thank you, da. I feel honored. Let's drink on it!
   1117109|00000000||Epidemic's long forgotten, sure. But the romantic bits in that adventure - don't plan to forget those.
   1117094|00000000||Though, in fact, I did start having fun when I kissed you.
   1117096|00000000||Thought that was more Vlodimir's doing.
   1102809|00000000||Not exactly my idea of a good time.
   1102811|00000000||What is?
   1102813|00000000||Time I spend with people I know.
   1102815|00000000||You know me.
   1102817|00000000||True. And now I'm starting to enjoy this.
   1102806|00000000||Weddings - not my thing.
   1114118|00000000||Did you enjoy the wedding?
   1102608|00000000||I'm afraid the drink's gotten to our minstrels. Horribly off-key.
   1102610|00000000||Let's go for a walk.
   1102612|00000000||Good idea.
   1116992|00000000||You got me.
   1116994|00000000||For how long? A day, two? Don't get me wrong, it's nice, but… you come and go. Yet I need someone who'll be there every night when I come home. After a day of bandaging wounds and sewing up guts, I need a good glass and a good laugh with someone who'll help me forget it all for a moment…
   1116996|00000000||I get it. And yeah, could never be there for you everyday. But I am happy to see you always. And today, I'm all yours.
   1117023|00000000||Hm, well, in that case let's drink to tonight.
   1117033|00000000||To tonight. May the moment last.
   1116985|00000000||You've got me.
   1095906|00000000||Smile, Shani.
   1095908|00000000||You remembered I liked the rowan.
   1113306|00000000||Remember a lot of things about you.
   1122474|00000000||Still here? Thought you had to meet Olgierd.
   1122476|00000000||You and I see each other so rarely. Figured Olgierd could wait till morning.
    465467|05df8c2c||Golem
   1116675|00000000||C'mon, old chap. To the newlyweds!
   1116673|00000000||The bride and groom!
   1127410|00000000||White Wolf's turned into the White Ass! Hahahahah…!
   1125214|00000000||Blood stains… months old.
   1114706|00000000||Greetings, honored guest.
   1114702|00000000||Yes?
   1114704|00000000||C-c-calm down!
   1115994|00000000||Ehh?
   1115996|00000000||Stop that!
   1115998|00000000||Beg your pardon!
   1116002|00000000||Aaarrrgh!
   1116000|00000000||Geralt! Help!
   1112928|00000000||Rot take your arsehole!
   1112936|00000000||Oooh! Wolf pup's got teeth!
   1112938|00000000||Bugger's going down!
   1112930|00000000||Your mam smells of gooseberries!
   1112940|00000000||Eternal Fire!
   1112944|00000000||Oh, parched. Could really use a swig o' somethin'.
   1112942|00000000||Got me a great job, eh?
   1112946|00000000||You! Yeah, you! No funny stuff.
   1114929|00000000||Olgierd's wishes were unusual, to say the least. One demand was for Geralt to bring him the house of Maximillian Borsodi. He didn't supplement this request with such key details as where this house was located or just how the witcher was to transport said real estate. Geralt only knew his first stop should be Oxenfurt, the city to which the Borsodis had moved their world-famous auction house...<br>
   1114930|00000000||Horst Borsodi did not demonstrate a flare for hospitality. He greeted Geralt with unmasked disdain, then, upon hearing the witcher had come for Maximilian Borsodi's House, had him summarily tossed into the gutter. Geralt was still picking himself up when he discovered a stranger awaiting him there... a man who could help him fulfill Olgierd's wish.<br>
   1114931|00000000||The mysterious stranger revealed that he was planning to rob the Borsodis' Auction House. He swore Geralt would find Maximilian's House within it, as impossible as that sounded. First, however, the witcher would have to help him put together a full break-in crew of daring professionals and find a way to weaken the Redanian garrison. Though Geralt usually tried to live within the bounds of the law, this time he had no choice but to agree to help in this criminal enterprise.<br>
   1114932|00000000||Geralt managed to put together a full crew, though this was no simple task. His next was not any easier: he and the assembled crew had to break into the Borsodis' well-guarded auction house, then force open the door to the vault located within. Many a safecracker had tried this before – and all had landed in the dreaded Oxenfurt prison.<br>
   1114933|00000000||Not everything went according to plan… to say the least. Geralt successfully broke into the vault, though at the cost of some nerve-wracking moments and a good deal of bloodshed. Once in the bowels of the auction house, he found out his partner-in-crime was none other than Horst Borsodi's long-missing brother, Ewald. Cheated by his brother out of his inheritance, Ewald had planned his revenge during long years of exile – and the witcher helped him bring this plan to fruition.<br>
   1114934|00000000||Not everything went according to plan… to say the least. Geralt successfully broke into the vault, though at the cost of some nerve-wracking moments and a good deal of bloodshed. Once in the bowels of the auction house, he found out that his partner-in-crime was none other than Horst Borsodi's long-missing brother, Ewald. Cheated by his brother out of his inheritance, Ewald had planned his revenge during his long years of exile. Yet now, on the cusp of his plan's completion, the White Wolf stood in his way. Geralt hadn't trusted Ewald from the very start and decided to hold his nose and support the disagreeable Horst rather than help Ewald commit fratricide.<br>
   1114935|00000000||Yet fratricide occurred nonetheless – for Horst killed his younger brother. The blood still on his hands, he gave Geralt the golden casket known as Maximilian Borsodi's House in compensation for his help, though not before taking for himself the will hidden inside it. With this in his possession, Geralt was set to fulfill Olgierd's request.<br>
   1114936|00000000||Ewald killed his older brother, avenging years of poverty and humiliation in one furious moment. The blood still on his hands, he gave Geralt the golden casket known as Maximilian Borsodi's House in compensation for his help, though not before taking for himself the will hidden inside it. With this in his possession, Geralt was set to fulfill Olgierd's request.<br>
   1114937|00000000||Yet when Geralt realized the remaining Borsodi brother was using him as well, he made sure he joined his recently murdered sibling in the afterlife. With no one left to lay a competing claim on it, Geralt took the golden casket known as Maximilian Borsodi's House and the will hidden inside it. Now he was set to fulfill Olgierd's request.<br>

   1118318|00000000||Did you find my shoe?!
   1118320|00000000||If not, I think you should come back and look for it! In the lake!
   1093620|00000000||Damn mucky, that pond. Sank in up to my armpits.
   1101522|00000000||Mucky as it might be, the lake still couldn't keep my shoe from you.
   1093630|00000000||See, my blueberry? Such devotion in a small matter. Now imagine my devotion in matters large.
   1101524|00000000||Hmm, something specific in mind?
   1101526|00000000||Why, naturally! Ride off with me, Shani! To Kovir, Poviss, Zerrikania, even! With a maid like you at my side, I could conquer the world!
   1116535|00000000||Haha. Lovely plans, but I fear they're impossible to realize in just one evening.
   1116537|00000000||Too true. But it's nice to dream.
   1118957|00000000||It'll be midnight soon. The capping will begin.
   1118959|00000000||What? How? Already? Damn, time soars…
   1118961|00000000||We need to go to the barn. All the guests must attend the capping. Including you.
   1120071|00000000||I know, I know. I shall be there soon.
   1116568|00000000||Ah well. Recognize this, Cinderella?
   1116570|00000000||My shoe?
   1127133|00000000||Mhm… now extend your supple leg and let me slide it in-- that is, on…
   1127135|00000000||Uh, thank you.
   1115664|00000000||Huh. I see no amount of silt could keep you from my shoe. And all the other shoes ever tossed in the lake.
   1115666|00000000||Always better to do a bit more and even gain naught by it, than to do too little and face regret.
   1129224|00000000||Hm, that's quite the theory.
   1129226|00000000||One founded in practice. For instance, I can now approach the owner of any of these slippers and she will lift up her skirt and bend over… to don it, of course.
   1129228|00000000||Ah, so generous - and clever!
   1115668|00000000||Just figuring that out? Hm, I believe I've earned a kiss.
   1115670|00000000||Well, find the owners of those shoes. One might agree.
   1116565|00000000||Don't be jealous, Shani, that was but a jest. I don't give a piffle about the others.
   1118371|00000000||Stay calm, my crimson dove. Vlod will see to everything.
   1101516|00000000||Never expected silt could conquer a man like you.
   1093622|00000000||Alas, I couldn't raise it up - for the first time in my life, I swear, Shani.
   1093624|00000000||Devastating for you, I'm sure - but I'm left without a shoe.
   1093626|00000000||Never fear. I shall retrieve it - or drown trying.
   1093640|00000000||Seen what he pulled from the water? An old pot!
   1093642|00000000||Mayhaps his lass wears pots for shoes - case she can't find a privy!
   1093644|00000000||You were s'posed to fish out me slipper. How'm I to dance now, with one foot bared? 'Tis a wedding, I've got to wear slippers!
   1101494|00000000||I looked, dearie, I did. 'Tain't there. Muck must've sucked it deep in.
   1101496|00000000||Well poke your paws in there! Rut for it! Rubbish game.
   1110432|00000000||What's all this, then?
   1101485|00000000||They're playing "Slip In for a Slipper." Never heard of it?
   1110434|00000000||Never. Us gentryfolk have other diversions. What's the object?
   1110436|00000000||Maid tosses her shoe in the water, her man's got to dive in an' fish it out.
   1124658|00000000||Look, mutations don't just turn them barren as a mule, they give 'em an ass's ears to boot! Hah. Must have some other horse part hidden in his trousers.
   1126581|00000000||Oh my…
   1126584|00000000||Oh, there's more to come…
   1112345|00000000||Prime game! Shani, your slipper! I shall prove I'd dive to any depth for you!
   1105324|00000000||I'd like to join in this fun.
   1105325|00000000||What will I get if I retrieve the shoe?
   1116516|00000000||And once I retrieve it?
   1116518|00000000||Well, your maid'll be pleased as punch, for it means you're a gallant beau and awful handy…
   1116520|00000000||Is that all? No prize? Not even a kiss?
   1116522|00000000||That depends on the miss in question. If she wants to give you a kiss, she will. But she ain't obliged.
   1120061|00000000||Just when you think you know all the ploughfolk's customs, they surprise you with slippers.
   1118442|00000000||So now the shock's faded, perhaps you could stop talking and fish out my shoe, which I so unfortunately lost in the pond?
   1093650|00000000||See how quick he come up with her shoe, loves? Ehh… lad like that'd be a treasure 'round the farm.
   1093652|00000000||Really? Dunno, meself. Losin' shoes in lakes has never been much of a problem at my place.
   1101534|00000000||Thick, y'are. 'Tain't about fishin' up shoes - it's about what else he might do a proper job of.
   1093646|00000000||He looked hearty enough, but couldn't even pull up a measly slipper.
   1093648|00000000||That's how it goes - the louder a cow moos, the drier its udders.
   1101537|00000000||Still, he's right 'andsome.
   1101539|00000000||What of it? He'll fatten, then wrinkle like a prune without. Stay the same good-for-nothin' inside.
   1112651|00000000||Nothing like a good swim.
   1112653|00000000||Now we must do something else. Something wild.
   1107318|00000000||Look, a lake! I can't remember the last time I had a dip…
   1107320|00000000||What're they up to…?
   1116573|00000000||Jozzy! What's takin' you so long?
   1116575|00000000||Bring me my shoe! Quick, now! It's gettin' shameful!
   1116577|00000000||Fine lad you got there, haven't you, Yagna?! Can't even pull a li'l slipper out of a pond…
   1116579|00000000||An' here I swim like a greased minnow - best in the village. Told you.
   1118457|00000000||Seems to think the slippin'll be easy, don't he?
   1120063|00000000||He talks a big talk, let's see how big his stroke is.
   1118459|00000000||That one's a witcher.
   1120065|00000000||Beh, so what? Witchers famed for shoe-fishin' skills, or somethin'?
   1120067|00000000||Sure as rain, he'll come up empty-handed.
   1122756|00000000||Observe, Shani.
   1122758|00000000||My eyes are glued.
   1118461|00000000||What's this one playin' at? Slip In for a Slipper, or stand-there-'n-do-nothing?
   1118463|00000000||Tossed the shoe in all gallant-like. Seems lots less eager to dive in after it.
   1118465|00000000||Guess his maid's gonna dance the rest o' the weddin' barefoot.
   1120069|00000000||Or just hop 'round on one.
   1123053|00000000||Though he carried several pounds of silver on his back at all times, Geralt was usually quite coin-poor. Quality witcher gear costs a fortune, the rewards for his contracts were often meager and he often found it hard to resist splurging on rare gwent cards.<br><br>Just when, despite all these obstacles, he'd managed to put together something of a nest egg... the tax office turned its greedy gaze on him!<br>
   1123054|00000000||Geralt evaded the tax man without much difficulty, however - he muddled  Deputy Tax Enumerator Walthemor Mitty's mind and sent him off into the wilds. A shame us mere mortals have no such means at our disposal!<br>
   1123055|00000000||Geralt patiently explained to the tax collector that he had made his modest fortune honestly, without breaking any of the tax codes numerous rules.  Deputy Tax Enumerator Walthemor Mitty was so impressed by this honesty he awarded the witcher a commemorative vellum diploma. He advised Geralt to hang it somewhere at Kaer Morhen – above the mantle, if possible.<br>
   1123056|00000000||The audit ended with Geralt receiving a summons for the payment of back taxes. A rather unpleasant turn of events, but what could Geralt do? Fighting the Wild Hunt's one thing, but taking on the tax office… that could get him in real trouble.<br>
   1123057|00000000||The witcher thus made his way to the Vivaldi Bank's Novigrad branch and paid every crown of his tax arrears. This lightened his coin pouch considerably and put him in a foul mood, but at least he could rest assured the tax office was now off his back.<br>
   1123059|00000000||Talk to the Deputy Tax Enumerator.
   1123058|00000000||Pay your back taxes at the Vivaldi Bank.
   1123181|00000000||The Taxman Cometh
   1103092|00000000||So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
   1103120|00000000||I wanted to congratulate you. You acquitted yourself splendidly with Olgierd. In fact, you've almost satisfied your debt.
   1103122|00000000||Was supposed to fulfill his three wishes. Did just that. This is where you remove the brand. 'Cause we're even.
   1128054|00000000||Nearly. To fulfill the terms of the contract to the letter, you must do one more thing - draw Olgierd to the Temple of Lilvani.
   1103124|00000000||We never discussed that.
   1103146|00000000||Oh, but we did. As a man of the world you should know every contract contains a catch or two. Small print, which nevertheless changes the ultimate meaning of the pact.
   1130087|00000000||This applies to oral contracts as well. Recall that I said, and I quote, "I believe, however, that all will end well. And once it does, we three shall meet and thank one another for the voyage we shared" - end quote.
   1130089|00000000||Mh, yeah, I remember.
   1103149|00000000||Fulfill your end of the bargain, and I will remove the brand.
   1103152|00000000||That was the last time you interrupted me while I was talking to someone.
   1103155|00000000||What the devil?
   1103157|00000000||Why's there a fly in my soup?
   1103159|00000000||Was waitin', had an eye out for you. Didn't see you come in. How's it you're here?
   1103177|00000000||I can control time.
   1103195|00000000||Old witcher's trick. I concentrate real, real hard, and I can control time and space.
   1103181|00000000||You toss this fly in my soup?!
   1103183|00000000||No. Now listen carefully. Tell your ataman to come to the Temple of Lilvani. It's south of here. Entrance is inside a cave.
   1103495|00000000||Aaaaaa!
   1103497|00000000||What's the commotion?
   1103185|00000000||Lilvani's Temple. Got it?
   1103187|00000000||Aye. Got it.
   1123158|00000000||Hold there!
   1123161|00000000||Your friend, the medic - she were here. Asked that you look in on her.
   1103189|00000000||Thanks.
   1103179|00000000||I'm a witcher. Superhuman quickness - just one of my many qualities.
   1103160|00000000||I'm quick. Real quick.
   1102867|00000000||Why're you even here?
   1102964|00000000||Who are you, really?
   1102966|00000000||Gaunter O'Dimm, also known--
   1102968|00000000||Not what I'm asking.
   1102970|00000000||Ah, so you'd rather know what it is I do?
   1102972|00000000||In brief, I give folk what they ask for. You might say I simply grant their wishes.
   1102974|00000000||Yeah, awfully noble of you.
   1103038|00000000||That'd be downright noble… if you didn't always demand something in return.
   1103040|00000000||Law of the market. I was not the one to coin the phrase "Nothing comes free."
   1103249|00000000||You're not human, that's clear. So what are you? A demon? A djinn?
   1103251|00000000||Do you really wish to know?
   1103253|00000000||Yes.
   1103255|00000000||No, Geralt, you don't. This one time I shall spare you and not grant your wish.
   1103263|00000000||All who have learned my true name are now either dead or have met an even worse fate. Yet I still need you.
   1103015|00000000||And drop them in a world of hurt.
   1103017|00000000||No, not I. That would be their poorly formulated wishes.
   1103019|00000000||I'm no cheat. I give folk what they want, nothing more. That they oft desire unworthy things - that is entirely the fault of their rotten natures.
   1102973|00000000||And get them into trouble.
   1102865|00000000||Who are you, really?
   1102866|00000000||You control time, or is this just some trick?
   1102881|00000000||You actually control time, or is this just some conjurer's trick?
   1102883|00000000||What difference does it make?
   1102885|00000000||A big one.
   1102887|00000000||Hmm. Let us say time has always fascinated me, so I taught myself how best to use it.
   1102889|00000000||Why time, of all things?
   1102891|00000000||Geralt, there are four dimensions - length, width, height… and time. What would you have me fall in love with - width? Come, now - tsk tsk, tsk.
   1103359|00000000||Two pints! And be quick about it!
   1103361|00000000||Ugh, please, good sir - a bit of courtesy!
   1103363|00000000||So I look up, and, Bob's your uncle, he downs half the barrel in one draught!
   1102835|00000000||Geralt! Over here!
   1103378|00000000||Oi, whitey-locks! You's the look of a man who knows how to drink!
   1103380|00000000||Thanks. Some other time.
   1103382|00000000||Hey now, don't make me beg! It's my treat!
   1094528|00000000||Show off.
   1094530|00000000||Of course I am. Wouldn't you be? Time's a marvelous plaything.
   1102198|00000000||And a great spice to use in gingerbread.
   1102200|00000000||So… you were listening.
   1102840|00000000||Indeed, occasionally I find time manipulation irresistible. Controlling it offers so many appetizing opportunities.
   1102843|00000000||Like spiking the soup of unsavory individuals with appropriately ghastly things.
   1118737|00000000||Get behind him!
   1118739|00000000||Witchcraft!! Spells!
   1118741|00000000||Show no mercy nor compassion!
   1118743|00000000||You shall raise a sword and cut away the world's chancres!
   1118735|00000000||Death has come for you.
   1118731|00000000||From fire you were born and in fire you shall perish!
   1118745|00000000||Together, brethren! Our faith makes us one!
   1118733|00000000||I shall meet you in hell!
    577863|d84f8157||Noonwraith
   1107747|00000000||Agh, and to think I turned down a spot at Bonham's…
   1107749|00000000||Argh, you call this living…?
   1107745|00000000||That one's going places. Round the world, even.
   1107751|00000000||Mh?
   1107753|00000000||Uhh… yes?
   1117283|00000000||Seven li'l botchlings jumpin' on the bed, one fell down and broke its head…
   1117281|00000000||What can I do about it? Nothin'! That's what!
   1127414|00000000||Ah! "With monstrous 'ead and sickenin' cry, and ears like errant wings!"
   1107529|00000000||Esteemed ladies, honorable gentlemen! The auction will begin shortly! Take your places, please!
   1107531|00000000||Ah! At long last! Come with me to the fore. I won't see much elsewise.
