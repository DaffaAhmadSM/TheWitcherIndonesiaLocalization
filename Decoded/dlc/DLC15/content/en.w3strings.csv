   1071244|256561ab||Read for additional information.
   1092303|bd0bf760||Gaetan,<br><br>It's over. Soldiers have taken the school. They killed Axel and Cedric. As for Schrödinger, well, I can't say for sure - might be alive, might be dead. Bounties have been put on your head and mine. Avoid cities and the high roads. Don't attract any attention.<br><br>-Joël

   1138188|382945e1||Quest: Where the Cat and Wolf Play…
   1138211|bd35f62f||Explore a forgotten village and discover its terrifying secret. Find out who or what slaughtered its inhabitants and use all your witcher skills to confront this mysterious force.
   1088809|00000000||Fifty crowns.
   1090064|00000000||Fifty.
   1090060|00000000||Not in the mood for riddles.
   1090066|00000000||Not in the mood for guessing games.
   1090068|00000000||Hah. Knew you were no fun the minute I saw you…
   1090085|00000000||How'd you survive that?
   1090091|00000000||How the hell did you survive that? Pitchfork wounds're bad - know that all too well.
   1090093|00000000||I turned at the last instant. Prongs went in shallow, at an angle. Missed my lungs.
   1090108|00000000||Not my job to judge you.
   1090157|00000000||Ultimately, it's not my job to judge you.
   1088871|00000000||That's it? Not gonna lecture me? Make me promise to mend my ways?
   1088875|00000000||They call me the Butcher of Blaviken. For good reason. I know how it is. Sometimes… sometimes heads just roll.
   1090133|00000000||Wait.
   1090135|00000000||I'm no cheap prick like those hayseeds. I owe you something. Here, directions to my stash. Take what you want.
   1090137|00000000||Thanks.
   1090139|00000000||No, thank you. Good luck on the Path, wolf.
   1090154|00000000||Take care, now.
   1090119|00000000||Godspeed.
   1091227|00000000||You need to die.
   1091242|00000000||You won't leave here alive. Not after what you did.
   1091244|00000000||Uhh… don't I even get a chance to explain?
   1091246|00000000||This isn't a trial. Stand up.
   1091254|00000000||Fine. Drink.
   1091256|00000000||Hah, much appreciated. Behold, a witcher with honor…
   1091260|00000000||And no brains.
   1091251|00000000||Fine. Drink.
   1091262|00000000||From what I saw, uneven odds're what you like.
   1091264|00000000||Yeah. But only when they're in my favor.
   1091266|00000000||Sorry, not this time. Draw your sword.
   1091252|00000000||No chance.
   1091248|00000000||Hm, awful chivalrous. A regular defender of the downtrodden… so, mind if I have a dose of Swallow?
   1091250|00000000||C'mon, I'm injured. It'll even the odds a bit.
   1090122|00000000||Stand and fight.
   1090124|00000000||Ah, wow… So that chat - what the hell was the point?
   1090127|00000000||I give folk a chance to defend themselves. Unlike you.
   1090120|00000000||Prepare to fight.
   1088877|00000000||A lot of innocents died in that village.
   1088879|00000000||Yeah, they did. My fucking bad. Got carried away.
   1090115|00000000||Not the first time, either. Right?
   1090118|00000000||Wanna kill me, wolf? Fine, draw your blade. But don't force me to confess.
   1090107|00000000||Lots of innocents died in that village.
   1090109|00000000||Why'd you spare the girl?
   1090141|00000000||The girl - why'd you spare her?
   1090143|00000000||Cause-- Ah, it doesn't matter.
   1090145|00000000||Wouldn't have asked if it didn't. Talk.
   1090148|00000000||Reminded me of my sister - how I remember her from… just before they took me away to the School of the Cat.
   1090150|00000000||How is she now?
   1090152|00000000||Died about ten years ago. Of old age.
   1090192|00000000||Well, we've had our little heart-to-heart, witcher to witcher. What now?
   1090095|00000000||I admit, I lost my temper. Lost it bad.
   1090097|00000000||I'm used to shit bounties. To the cheating, to them begging me for help, then spitting as I pass.
   1090103|00000000||But murder me - just to save a few crowns? I'm supposed to protect whoresons like that?
   1090106|00000000||So I drew steel… and didn't sheathe it till the ground was slick with blood.
   1090087|00000000||So you decided to massacre the whole village.
   1090089|00000000||What would you have done? Gone to the local magistrate to file a complaint?
   1090084|00000000||You slaughtered every last villager.
   1090072|00000000||Twelve. Understand, pal? Twelve fucking crowns. Barely covers my potion ingredients.
   1090074|00000000||What had you agreed to?
   1090076|00000000||That several times over. But when it came time to pay up… ah, you know the routine. "Good sir, me young 'uns are starvin'. There's a war on! Gods have mercy! Show some pity…"
   1090187|00000000||Rings a bell. But that's no reason to kill.
   1090189|00000000||I'm not finished.
   1090079|00000000||Told them I wouldn't show pity. That if I didn't see gold, they'd wish they had the leshen back. They got these grim looks… then the ealdorman spoke.
   1090081|00000000||"Calm now, master witcher. Me and the lads, we hid some gold in the barn, so's the baron's men wouldn't take it. Come, you'll get your coin right quick."
   1090083|00000000||I fell for it. Like a fool. One of 'em chattered on, while another jabbed me in the back with a pitchfork.
   1090070|00000000||Ha-ha. If only.
   1090062|00000000||A hundred.
   1088808|00000000||A hundred crowns.
   1091229|00000000||I wanna chat first. Then we'll see.
   1091231|00000000||Take a seat.
   1091233|00000000||I'll stand.
   1091235|00000000||Now talk. Honorton - what happened?
   1091237|00000000||Come on. You know what happened.
   1091240|00000000||Know what they wanted to pay me for the leshen? Go on, guess.
   1091226|00000000||Not sure yet. We need to talk.
   1088775|00000000||You lost something.
   1088777|00000000||Come all that way to give me my medallion? Thanks. Craft solidarity's alive and well.
   1091223|00000000||Huh. But our craft's reputation is on its last legs. Folk won't easily forget that massacre.
   1091225|00000000||Occupational hazard. Could've happened to any one of us.
   1090016|00000000||Well? What're you still doin' here?
   1091111|00000000||A fellow witcher? Well, well, small world.
   1095549|00000000||Well, well, what have we here? Feline armor, wolf's head medallion - a crossbreed?
   1091545|00000000||Well? We gonna stand here like pricks on Belleteyn?
   1091547|00000000||You that eager? Well go ahead, then, check for traps.
   1091907|00000000||Bolko ought to go. Chap's got one lame leg already. He's not got so much to lose.
   1088652|00000000||Calm down. Just wanna talk to y--
   1088654|00000000||Leave me be! Killer! Murderer!
   1089880|00000000||Got it wrong. I'm--
   1089884|00000000||You've cat eyes! Same as him!
   1088656|00000000||That's 'cause I'm a witcher.
   1088662|00000000||That's 'cause I'm a witcher. I kill monsters.
   1088664|00000000||Said the same, that 'un! And ye seen what he done!
   1089885|00000000||I found your doll.
   1091135|00000000||Huh. This doll yours, maybe?
   1091139|00000000||T-tis.
   1091141|00000000||He got a name?
   1091144|00000000||M-master Freckleface.
   1091146|00000000||Hm, pretty.
   1091150|00000000||G-give 'im to me? Please?
   1089968|00000000||Shh. That's enough.
   1089974|00000000||Sh-sh-sh. Think I know the rest.
   1089967|00000000||What happened?
   1089970|00000000||And… what?
   1089972|00000000||I'm not sure… I… I heard 'em screamin'… Uncle Sobemir… and the others.
   1090183|00000000||Then that… that witcher, he ran outta the barn, blood all over 'im. And anybody who… well, all of 'em, one by one - with his sword, like this. Me mum and me brother, too.
   1089977|00000000||He let me go. I don't know why. And then… he went thataway, towards the circle where we leave gifts for the gods. I hid… in the barn. Found this lyin' in the hay.
   1089979|00000000||School of the Cat…
   1089981|00000000||Thanks. You've been a big help. What'll you do - got any family around here?
   1089983|00000000||Me auntie. Lives in Oreton.
   1091536|00000000||I'll take you to her. But first I gotta see to this bad man.
   1091989|00000000||This doll's yours, right? Hug it close and stay put, understood?
   1091541|00000000||Wait here for me. Master Freckleface can keep you company. Stay put and keep quiet, understood?
   1091538|00000000||Stay put and keep quiet, understood?
   1091177|00000000||Sit tight, kid.
   1089956|00000000||Our woods - they was haunted. Some spook. Uncle Sobemir said we'd best fetch a witcher.
   1089958|00000000||So one came. Looked lots like you, but… there were evil in his eyes.
   1089960|00000000||He brought us the spook's head 'cept… Uncle Sobemir weren't happy 'bout somethin'. They yelled and they cursed.
   1091168|00000000||And then… they went to the barn, and… and…
   1091156|00000000||Doubt Master Freckleface'd be much help on the Path, so… here.
   1091166|00000000||Now, think you could tell me what happened here? I need to know.
   1091151|00000000||Of course. Here.
   1091152|00000000||First tell me what happened.
   1091158|00000000||Oh, you'll get him back… but you gotta tell me what happened here first.
   1091161|00000000||Pinky promise?
   1091163|00000000||Cross my heart.
   1089919|00000000||All right, enough. Tell me what happened here.
   1089948|00000000||Aye… I'll tell ye.
   1089887|00000000||Stop it. Tell me what happened.
   1088670|00000000||Did he have two swords? On his back?
   1088672|00000000||Not tellin' ye nothin'! Go away!
   1088658|00000000||Same as…?
   1088660|00000000||Same as 'im! The bad man who killed everyone!
   1088655|00000000||Same as who?
   1091174|00000000||Go and find her. Travel by day. Stay on the main road and don't make any noise, got it?
   1091172|00000000||Take Master Freckleface and go and find her. Travel by day. Stay on the main road and don't make any noise, got it?
   1091902|00000000||I'm cold.
   1055372|ad41ad88||Alghoul
   1097623|00000000||Gaetan probably hadn't expected that Geralt would spare his life. Out of gratitude, he told Geralt where he'd hidden a stash of goods and said he could take from there whatever he wanted. Then the two witchers parted ways - and never met again.
   1097624|00000000||It turned out local bandits had found Gaetan's stash first. Yet before they could seize it and liquidate its assets, Geralt liquidated them.
   1097776|00000000||Go to the School of the Cat witcher's stash to collect your reward.
   1105282|00000000||Take What You Want
   1089876|00000000||Shit… Stop!
   1089878|00000000||Something odd about this. Might find more clues in the village.
   1088526|00000000||Imperial mustache, plump cheeks… important man.
   1088528|00000000||Cause of death - stab wound. Blade between the ribs, straight to the heart.
   1088530|00000000||Holding something. Silver chain - snapped. Ripped it off someone.
   1091131|00000000||Hey, wait! Dammit…
   1091133|00000000||Hey, wait! Dammit…
   1092008|00000000||Gaetan
   1091801|00000000||You're back! I thought… thought you'd not return! That he'd hurt you, too!
   1091909|00000000||I'm fine.
   1091911|00000000||And he won't hurt anyone ever again.
   1091913|00000000||And you don't need to worry about him anymore.
   1091915|00000000||So… so you'll take me to my auntie's? It's… it's awful here.
   1091807|00000000||Sure thing. Let's go.
   1091809|00000000||Think… think I could ride on your shoulders?
   1091919|00000000||Hm. So long as you promise not to pull my hair.
   1091921|00000000||I promise!
   1091924|00000000||Then hop on up.
   1091802|00000000||Yeah. Let's go.
   1091805|00000000||I will, but not yet. Wait here just a bit longer.
   1091803|00000000||In a bit.
   1091838|00000000||Auntie! Auntie Lucy!
   1091840|00000000||Millie? What're you doin' here, you naughty girl?!
   1091842|00000000||I… 'cause… back in the village… there's no--
   1091929|00000000||I'll explain. You run along and play a bit, all right?
   1091844|00000000||There was a massacre in Honorton. No survivors - well… except her.
   1091933|00000000||Gods… What happened? A bandit attack?
   1092040|00000000||He's received the ultimate punishment. Enough said.
   1097963|00000000||What of it? Ye think that settles things? That folk'll forget?
   1097965|00000000||No, they won't forget. They'll continue to fear us, hate us. I've grown accustomed.
   1097967|00000000||Doesn't matter. Didn't come here to make peace.
   1091940|00000000||No. A… another witcher did it. Villagers provoked him.
   1091943|00000000||They speak true of you lot. Heartless and cruel, murderers all.
   1091945|00000000||Not all.
   1091935|00000000||Another witcher did it.
   1091947|00000000||A monster killed them. A leshen. They'd posted a contract… but I arrived too late.
   1091949|00000000||Twas a lovely village… Good folk lived there, good and true. Ahh, 'tis tragic! Tragic indeed!
   1091936|00000000||The spook they were having trouble with killed them.
   1091934|00000000||Something like that.
   1091938|00000000||You could say that.
   1091952|00000000||You'll look after her?
   1091955|00000000||Truth be told… you'd do better to take her with you.
   1091957|00000000||What? You call me a murderer, then wanna entrust a child to me?
   1091959|00000000||Ye shan't lead her round with an empty belly, there's that.
   1091961|00000000||Funny. Used to be folk were afraid we'd take their kids.
   1091963|00000000||Used to be folk weren't so in need.
   1091965|00000000||Got four of me own grandkids. Used to be six… but we buried two last winter.
   1091967|00000000||Hard to live off naught but bark soup.
   1091850|00000000||Times're tough.
   1091973|00000000||Agh, what do you know about it? Begone, already.
   1091846|00000000||Times are tough.
   1091845|00000000||Take this coin.
   1091848|00000000||Take this. Use it for food - and only food. If I come back and see you drinking…
   1091971|00000000||So much? The gods reward ye, master witcher! A thousand blessings!
   1091852|00000000||Time I was on my way.
   1091854|00000000||Now? But… but why?
   1091976|00000000||Witcher's lot in life - always on the road, on the Path.
   1091978|00000000||Will ye comeback and see me sometime?
   1091980|00000000||Hope so. Take care, kid.
   1091983|00000000||Millie! Come, child, we'll buy a bit o' flour. Your aunt'll whip up some pancakes. Sound good to ye?
   1091986|00000000||Millie! Drop that doll and grab the broom! There's work to be done!
   1091991|00000000||It's me, Millie! Remember me?
   1091993|00000000||Course I do.
   1091995|00000000||I… I've a gift for ye. 'Cause mummy always said if someone's nice, ye gotta thank 'em!
   1091998|00000000||If only more people believed that.
   1092000|00000000||I best be goin'. Auntie says I'm not to stray far from home.
   1092002|00000000||Wise words. Be careful… and thanks for the gift.
   1092007|00000000||Hey! Wait! I've somethin' for you!
   1089167|00000000||Life in Velen is not easy. Bandits and monsters prowl the woods. Armies trample the fields and raid the granaries. Disease is on everyone's lips - literally. Yet, as the popular saying in those parts went, nothing's so bad that it can't get worse - the truth of which the inhabitants of Honorton learned in the most brutal way possible. Their entire village was murdered, leaving only necrophages to walk the paths between its huts.
   1089168|00000000||Geralt would often state that every witcher contract is the same. Read a notice, find who posted it, argue over the reward, seek out witnesses, etc., ad nauseam. I, however, always held that beneath these superficial similarities lay an ocean of difference. For example, Geralt would sometimes discover his employers had brought the beast upon themselves, while other times he'd learn killing the monster in question was but part of someone's larger (usually nefarious) scheme. And once, in Honorton... Ah, now that was another contract altogether.
   1089169|00000000||It turned out the brutal perpetrator of the massacre of Honorton was not a monster nor even a bandit, but one of Geralt's fellow practitioners - a witcher from the ill-famed School of the Cat.
   1089170|00000000||Geralt held his duty was to protect sentient beings from threats no others could vanquish - no matter whether the beings in question were cheats or saints. Gaetan had proven himself just such a threat, so Geralt paid no heed to his justifications and killed his fellow witcher.
   1089171|00000000||Gaetan, a witcher from the School of the Cat, murdered people he had sworn to protect. They themselves were, to say the least, not without sin - instead of showing due gratitude for his completion of a dangerous contract, they had tried to take his life in an underhanded manner. Be that as it may, if the matter had been put before a judge, Gaetan would have surely ended on the gallows. But Geralt was no judge. He was a witcher.
   1091884|00000000||As for the little girl who was the sole survivor of the massacre, the witcher did the only thing he could - he took her to her kin. He then bid farewell, hoping she would be given a warm nook to sleep in and a bowl of nourishing vittles every evening.
   1097798|00000000||As for the little girl… to speak truth, I don't know what became of her. Perhaps she managed to find her aunt in Oreton on her own. Or perhaps she ended in a wolf's belly.

   1088564|00000000||A leshen's head. Chopped off with a sharp knife.
   1088548|00000000||Must be Honorton, village from the notice. Except… it's awful quiet.
   1088550|00000000||Necrophages. Great.
   1088552|00000000||Quiet here… and it stinks of carrion. Not good.
   1088554|00000000||Not a living soul in sight. Something evil's been here. Necrophages appeared after.
   1088556|00000000||Necrophages tore the body apart. Can't say what killed him, though.
   1088558|00000000||Hut wasn't looted. Can rule out robbery as a motive.
   1088560|00000000||Fire's still burning. This happened recently.
   1088562|00000000||Somebody's well-off. Especially for Velen.
   1088570|00000000||Cuts. Shallow… but each hit an artery.
   1088572|00000000||Blade pierced her back, between vertebrae. Severed her spinal cord.
   1089872|00000000||She couldn't move. Bled to death.
   1088574|00000000||Arm severed above the elbow. With one blow.
   1088576|00000000||Blood… mixed with something. That smell… alcohol, earthball and wolfsbane. A potion.
   1089874|00000000||This blood didn't come from a peasant.
   1088578|00000000||Pitchfork. Dangerous weapon at close quarters.
   1088580|00000000||First cut severed the aorta. Second hit the femoral artery. He died quickly, didn't put up a fight.
   1088603|00000000||Bolt… snapped in half.
   1088605|00000000||Aha - gotcha.
   1088607|00000000||Don't worry. I'm not going to hurt you.
   1088566|00000000||Well, well… somebody beat me to it.
   1088644|00000000||If he went off towards the circle, that'd be the place to start.
   1088646|00000000||Palm print… in blood. Had his hand on his wound. Slipped and leaned on his hand to catch his balance.
   1088648|00000000||Footprints. Barely visible. Must be him.
   1088650|00000000||Blood… still fresh. He's close.
   1088893|00000000||Foglet, ghoul, grave hag… Wonder why he didn't turn in these trophies. Maybe they tried to cheat him then, too.
   1090378|00000000||Perfect strike. Died before he hit the ground.
   1090387|00000000||These must be her tracks.
   1090389|00000000||The stone circle. Need to look around.
   1090448|00000000||Gut sliced open. Probably died defending its owner.
   1090446|00000000||Blade pierced internal organs.
   1090444|00000000||Died without a fight. Butchered.
   1090354|00000000||Sword wounds.
   1091091|00000000||A doll… and a child's footprints.
   1091093|00000000||In one window, out the other. Smart.
   1091113|00000000||A doll. Fabric's saturated with smoke… Same smell's coming from somewhere else.
   1091474|00000000||The soil lie light upon you.
   1088895|00000000||Must be the hideout. Let's see what School of the Cat witchers stash away.
   1097887|00000000||Should get back to the kid. Before something else sniffs her out.
   1088568|00000000||Nice work. Must be an expert.
   1088582|00000000||Dammit. Must've been a witcher. Killed the leshen… then the villagers.
   1088584|00000000||That was his medallion chain in the barn. Might've lost something else there. Should look around.
