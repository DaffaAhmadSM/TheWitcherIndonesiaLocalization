   1144407|00000000||The blade - put it away, witcher.

   1172874|00000000||To have a specimen like that for an autopsy…
   1172878|00000000||How's your health, witcher?
   1172880|00000000||No aches? No itches?

   1193327|00000000||What a story… A wandering witcher slew the Beast…
   1175186|00000000||My, do I ever feel like doing absolutely nothing…

   1106251|00000000||A short distance from Castel Ravello, Geralt happened on a notice posted by Jacob, a lumberjack. The logger was in search of someone who had no fear of spells and could thus face a witch. This was the very description of the witcher, no two ways about it, so it was no surprise that our hero took an interest in the notice and decided to visit Jacob.<br>
   1106252|00000000||Geralt found the witch of Lynx Crag and did precisely what the knight from Herrera's tale was said to have done. He bowed before her and asked her for help. Though fussy, the witch seemed appeased and betrayed the manner in which the woman imprisoned in the tree could be freed. The success was bitter-sweet, however, as neither the witch nor the witcher could restore to the woman the life she had lost. Shortly after being freed, her spirit left this world, though it did so at peace with its fate.<br>
   1126011|00000000||Upon Lynx Crag the witcher encountered the witch, but he decided not to seek her aid in freeing the woman enchanted in the tree. Our hero decided he would employ his own devices to lift the curse. He managed to free Daphne's ghost, yet her specter was crazed and filled with pain. Geralt had no choice but to defeat it.<br>
   1155688|00000000||Upon Lynx Crag the witcher encountered the witch and resolved to force her to help him. Defeated in combat, she pledged to free the cursed woman from the tree. Yet her pledge proved a ruse. Upon returning to the tree, the witcher found the lumberjack's cold corpse at its foot. Freed by the witch, the young woman's ghost, crazed with pain, had killed Jacob, then disappeared to parts unknown.
   1106254|00000000||Jacob proved a true expert on tales. The lumberjack readily explained to Geralt that the woman enchanted in the tree was Daphne, transformed out of great longing due to her deep love for the knight Gareth, whose return she awaited. Gareth had gone off to scale Lynx Crag, atop which he was to find the witch who dwelled there. He was to force her to lift the drought that plagued the land. Alas, the knight had not returned, and the tale from which the logger drew his knowledge said nothing about what had befallen the knight. if there was any answer to the mystery, if could only be found on Lynx Crag.<br>
   1155687|00000000||In a loggers' clearing near the village of Fox Hollow, Geralt happened upon a lumberjack named Jacob. The man claimed to have recently discovered an enchanted tree that seemed straight out of Herrera's Tales. He believed a young woman was imprisoned in the tree and desperately wished to free her. Though not one to believe fables and similar tales, Geralt nonetheless had to admit the tree was peculiar, for cut with an axe head it seeped not sap but human blood.<br>
   1104596|00000000||Examine the bleeding tree.
   1104597|00000000||Talk to Jacob the woodcutter.

   1104604|00000000||Defeat the wraith from the bleeding tree.
   1104605|00000000||Return to Jacob the woodcutter.

   1105036|00000000||Examine the woodcutter's body.

   1205791|00000000||Descending the hill atop which stood Dun Tynne, Geralt came upon a wounded vintner begging for help. The dugout he had turned into a barrel storeroom was infested with monsters!<br>
   1205792|00000000||It was witcher's work in its purest form, and Geralt tended to the matter quickly.<br>
   1205793|00000000||The vintner thanked the witcher in hard currency, and our hero once again set off on his Path.<br>
   1205794|00000000||Kill all the monsters feeding in the cave.

   1147948|00000000||Hm, scissors're completely dull. No way he could use these to cut hair.
   1100667|00000000||Lock's untouched. No attempt at forced entry.
   1145749|00000000||This jar's empty, too.
   1205819|00000000||No evidence of a break-in, no signs of a struggle. To my mind, he just went out to find ingredients for his pomade. Looks like he ran out… of pomade.
   1205821|00000000||Yes, indeed! He'd have gone into the meadows beyond the city to gather flower petals for it. Trolls must have devoured him! Or a cyclops! Splendid, either way!
   1205823|00000000||Think you could find the place using his map?
   1205825|00000000||Naturally.
   1092920|00000000||Empty pomade jar… Strong floral fragrance. Akh akh. Ugh, very strong.
   1104928|00000000||That's Jean-Louis' Special Floral Elixir! Recipe's a jealously guarded secret.
   1188856|00000000||Hmm… looks like he ran out.
   1147970|00000000||Dried flowers. Pretty fragrant, still…
   1097288|00000000||The coiffeur's log… A manicure, curling, Cintrian pendulum, Rivian ponytail, raftsman's do. Hm, long out of style in Novigrad.
   1105974|00000000||Ah, his appointments. Last one was a certain… Lady le Pompidou. Know her?
   1097290|00000000||Yes, a dear old bird. Jean-Louis's done her hair for a decade. Completely harmless.
   1164865|00000000||Sketch here, looks like a map. This mean anything to you?
   1164867|00000000||Hmm. I may understand where it points. But if so, there's naught there. Just fields and meadows…
   1205815|00000000||Around he looked, yet all was quite proper. "I see razors, pomades, but no blasted hair-chopper!"
   1205817|00000000||Mind being quiet for a minute? Think I might know what happened to the hairdresser.
   1205827|00000000||Lead the way, then.
   1163049|00000000||Think I understand--
   1163051|00000000||As do I! Perhaps.

   1182519|00000000||My hands shake so bad, I cannot hold my tools!

   1135519|00000000||How might I help, friend? Do you need to swap currencies? Or perhaps a small loan at a reasonable rate?
   1135533|00000000||I'd like to change some coin.
   1135535|00000000||Naturally. How much do you wish to swap?
   1135512|00000000||Want to change some coin.
   1135537|00000000||Be back later.
   1135539|00000000||You know where to find me.
   1135513|00000000||Farewell.
   1135523|00000000||A regular customer is always a pleasant sight. Have you some custom for me?
   1135541|00000000||Psst, florens, orens, crowns - I've got them all! At preferential rates, too!
   1196715|00000000||Stay here, hunker down till dawn. Breath slowly, shallow breaths. Wont' be able to hear you, then. Understand?
   1196717|00000000||Y-y-yes.
   1159843|00000000||They'll not have my blood! Never!
   1159845|00000000||If I can just last the night…
   1160344|00000000||Deliver us, gods, from all fleders, bruxae and alps…
   1160342|00000000||Tell me, witcher, should I go at them with a stake? Or use temple-sanctified water?
   1160348|00000000||This is punishment for our many sins.
   1160346|00000000||That one, is he no vampire? He's pale… and has strange eyes.
   1160350|00000000||A silver sword? You must fight vampires with fire, that's what my nonni said!
   1160352|00000000||The palace awash with blood… Great gods.
   1196440|00000000||Faster! Crikey, faster!
   1196448|00000000||That's enough! We cannot hope to carry more!
   1196450|00000000||Shut your trap! You'd do better to keep a keen eye out for beasts. Or the Guard.
   1196452|00000000||Shhhh.
   1196454|00000000||He'll tell the Guard! He's got to die!
   1196458|00000000||Lovely, that armor! More loot once we're done with you!
   1196456|00000000||Many folk have died today. What's another corpse? No one'll give it a second thought.
   1196474|00000000||Virtues! You knights have forsworn the virtues! The gods have seen fit to punish us all!
   1196476|00000000||Shut your mouth! You'll draw them here!
   1196482|00000000||Dammit. Swarms of 'em. Probably better to go around.
   1196484|00000000||No way I'll get through there in one piece…
   1196488|00000000||Help! Help! Save me!
   1196490|00000000||Help me! I beg you!
   1196494|00000000||Aaargh! Aaargh! No! Help!
   1196492|00000000||Aaaaargh! Help me!
   1196591|00000000||A true champion slayer, you are. I thank you.
   1196589|00000000||Thanks… I would doubtless lie dead now were it not for your aid.
   1196597|00000000||Champion! Thanks be to the gods, the gods reward you!
   1196595|00000000||The beasts, I could barely see them. Gods, had you not come along… I…
   1196609|00000000||Ooph… I owe you my life, I do…
   1196611|00000000||Our champion! He'll fell the beasts, save all our skins!
   1196636|00000000||He's withdrawn to the palace. But his men… decimated.
   1196634|00000000||Word is he's holed up the bank. Barricaded in. But they'll not keep them out long.
   1196628|00000000||What the bloody misery is this?! What're our orders?! Speak!
   1196630|00000000||I don't know… It's a slaughter… Clement's unit, smashed… Cosma is dead…
   1196632|00000000||What of Captain Damien?
   1196650|00000000||N-n-n-n-no… P-p-p-please…
   1196652|00000000||B-b-b-bats… B-b-batfolk…!
   1173237|00000000||What can I forge for you today?
   1173235|00000000||Hip hip hullo!
   1197094|00000000||Bravo, bumbotching bravo! A thumping good show at the tournament, witcher!
   1197096|00000000||Behold, Geralt the witcher! The scourge of Starling Straggen and his hanse! Bravo, you old bumbasher!
   1197098|00000000||What a story! A lone witcher against a swarm of those stone-stingers… And he licked them, one and all!
   1198883|00000000||I heard you brought the hammer down on Fourfingers' hanse!
   1173239|00000000||Bastards! Mauls! Misericordes!
   1173241|00000000||Iron longs to be red hot!
   1173243|00000000||Watch it, or I'll take this hammer and--!
   1173245|00000000||Hold on. What's this supposed to mean?
   1191498|00000000||Fare thee unwell.
   1191500|00000000||Yes?
   1191502|00000000||Piss off.
   1191496|00000000||Kiss a dog's arse.
   1191504|00000000||Why'd y--?

   1195734|00000000||Now?! Or else?!
   1195736|00000000||Criminy!
   1195738|00000000||You're startin' to annoy me, grayboy.
   1176934|00000000||Expect me to thank you?
   1176944|00000000||Expect me to thank you? For taking such good care of the orphans?
   1176946|00000000||You care so much for their well-being… Hrmph, amusing. How do young witchers fare? How many survive your Trials?
   1176948|00000000||Don't change the subject. Not about to let you.
   1176950|00000000||Then get to the point.
   1176929|00000000||Did what you asked. Children's slaughter's the work of a garkain. One of those summoned by Dettlaff. Probably supposed to attack the city, children's scent lured it here.
   1188911|00000000||Yes… It carries quite a way. Its sweetness teases the nose, gets the mouth watering.
   1188913|00000000||Unseen Elder - where'll I find him. Talk.
   1153101|00000000||His lair lies west of the city, across the lake. Look for a cave near the shoreline… and this stone will open a hidden door.
   1153108|00000000||Not gonna take me there?
   1153111|00000000||I visit the Elder only when I absolutely must. You'll know why once you meet him.
   1179961|00000000||I'll come back for you one day. You realize that, right?
   1179963|00000000||Hm. Then I shall keep an eye out for you.
   1176936|00000000||I run into dilemmas all the time. Situations where it's hard to judge, hard to know what's right, make a decision.
   1176938|00000000||This is not one of them. You disgust me. And deserve to die.
   1176940|00000000||But?
   1176942|00000000||I'm in a hurry, and you're hiding behind a child. So you'll live this time. I'm letting you.
   1176933|00000000||You disgust me.
   1174627|00000000||I thought it would take you longer.
   1176916|00000000||It will. Still not done. Got one more thing to tend to. You.
   1176918|00000000||The orphanage - your wine cellar, right? A larder for blood?
   1174629|00000000||Tsk, tsk, tsk, I never said I helped these children out of the kindness of my heart.
   1176920|00000000||Go outside, little man. And lock the door behind you.
   1174633|00000000||No!!! Don't hurt her!
   1176930|00000000||Lady Orianna took care of us! She took us off the street, brought us sweets, sang to us! Leave her be!
   1176932|00000000||You see, witcher? The world's not black and white, it's shades of all kinds. I drank from the children, true… but never so much as to kill. And I gave them a great deal in return.
   1174617|00000000||Orianna?
   1174619|00000000||Aaargh…. Ugggh…

   1193013|00000000||But you promised! Uncle Durand said he'd throw a ball in his garden! With lovely elven statues!

   1156410|00000000||<i>A knight errant might manage to kill a ghoul and a peasant with a pack of dogs can at times take down a bear. Yet let us make one thing clear: not even the finest steel armor ever forged or the collar bone of Saint Plegmund himself will give a mortal man any chance of surviving a fight against the creatures that dwell deep beneath the earth.</i><br> – veteran Toussaint Ducal Guardsman, briefing new recruits<br>
   1173830|00000000||Imagine a creature that kills men, feeds on kikimore eggs and digs underground tunnels so wide they’d fit the emperor of Nilfgaard’s coronation carriage along with a team of six horses. And now imagine this creature digs with such force, the earth quakes and the houses up above tremble and collapse. Noting these symptoms, Geralt was at first unsure what sort of a beast he could be dealing with, knowing only that he needed to be very, very careful.<br><br>Only after he carefully examined the monster’s tracks did he realize it had to be an aged female shaelmaar.<br>
   1173833|00000000||The monster destroying Tufo turned out to be an old shaelmaar matriarch. Geralt hunted it down and fought it deep under the ground.<br><br>Though blind like all members of its species, this creature could easily maneuver by sensing vibrations and noises. As long as Geralt stood quiet and motionless, he was safe. Yet if he took one step or breathed a bit too loud, the matriarch would start moving in his direction with great speed.<br><br>Geralt had a very difficult time taking out this monster, whose armor could not be pierced by any of his weapons. In the end, however, he succeeded and the monster of Tufo was no more.

   1188874|00000000||<i>If you must travel through the woods, steer clear of any places where you can hear several different kinds of birds at once. That sound means you’re entering a bruxa’s territory and can kiss your life farewell.</i><br>– anonymous piece of advice</i><br><br>Fortunately for us all, bruxae are rare creatures. Most live far from population centers, for they care greatly for their own safety and make their lairs in places where they cannot be taken by surprise. Those who decide to live near men avoid crowds and emerge from their shelters only at night. When they do, one could almost mistake them for delayed travelers hurrying towards their night’s lodging, yet subtle details give them away: their close ties to birds, their piercing voices and the breathtaking speed of their movements. Bruxae are far swifter and stronger than men, but their greatest asset is their ability to turn invisible.<br>
   1208638|00000000||Bruxae dart about with uncanny speed, and with their power of invisibility they can easily confuse opponents and attack unexpectedly or from behind. Thus when fighting these vampires the Moon Dust bomb is a great aid – while it cannot eliminate the vampire’s invisibility altogether, it can make it easier to track its motions. A generous smearing of vampire oil is also effective.<br><br>Bruxae use their sharp claws to attack and can easily break through an opponent’s guard by buffeting him with a hail of blows from all directions. They will try to bite their prey and drink its blood once it is weakened, so every witcher who expects to encounter such a monster should swallow a Black Blood potion beforehand. Bruxae are also known for their sonic attacks, which knock down and stun their prey.

   1092717|00000000||That oughta do it.
   1092719|00000000||Already started in on it. Hope they didn't muck up the tracks.
   1123267|00000000||What the hell happened here…?
   1200578|00000000||Traces of draconid blood, barely perceptible. I'm on the right track.
   1201298|00000000||Good thing I incinerated those eggs back there. Now to collect my reward…
   1201300|00000000||Blood… Draconid must've hit it pretty hard. Dropped the cow, then probably tried to steady its flight. Got hurt in the process.
   1201302|00000000||Good. Should be simple to track down.
   1201306|00000000||Started bleeding, heavily. Wound was more serious than I thought, looks like.
   1201308|00000000||Paw prints. Crawled through here. Clearly too tired to fly.
   1201304|00000000||Landed on the roof of the distillery. Raised a ruckus, made a mess, then moved on…
   1201336|00000000||Dammit… Half-eaten body with… scorch marks? Hmm, definitely not a wyvern.
   1201629|00000000||Slyzard - gotta be. They breathe fire.
   1201338|00000000||Mhh, had it right. Slyzards stole the cows. Well, killed them already. Maybe now I can get someone to pay me for it.
   1201667|00000000||*Sniff sniff* Hmm. Smells like… sour mash. Draconid must've attacked a local distillery. Bastard.
   1204696|00000000||Aha. So it's a slyzard…
   1123616|00000000||Right. High time I collected a trophy.
   1092715|00000000||Rest of the eggs haven't hatched yet. Need to burn the whole nest.

   1188777|00000000||Every day the same - wine, wine and more crackswaddling wine. It's enough to drive you batty.
   1188785|00000000||Don't hurt me… Please!
   1198764|00000000||The word is the witcher commanded the Guard to chomp on garlic. So as to gain strength to fight the vampeers. The guardsman ate through the Pheasantry's whole supply!
   1198762|00000000||They say some daffy city girls try to summon ghosts in the old amphitheater!
   1198760|00000000||I hear there's a farm by the lake whose sheep-shearer was once hairdresser to the duchess!

   1184226|00000000||Of course! I shall be silent as the grave.
   1173552|00000000||Come, we must consider what to do.
   1181988|00000000||I… I'd recognize that voice anywhere!
   1181990|00000000||You… you must be mistaking me for someone else.
   1181992|00000000||I served fifteen years in the palace. Your Grace, I'd not mistake you for anyone.
   1181994|00000000||Shh! Not so loud. We are here incognito. On state business.
   1181996|00000000||Yes, Your Grace! How may I serve?
   1173606|00000000||Quickly! Upstairs.
   1184265|00000000||Lady Orianna's guests only.
   1189200|00000000||I'd give my life for Her Grace.
   1189198|00000000||You can count on me.
   1191859|00000000||Mm-hm...
   1191861|00000000||Care for a nibble?
   1191863|00000000||A beverage, maybe?
   1191865|00000000||Hungry or stupid?
   1213036|2abed69a||Messenger
   1197086|00000000||Some woman in town's gone mad. First she cut off her hubby's… bait and tackle, then, to spite all members of the uglier sex, she chiseled off Reginald's privates as well!
   1197088|00000000||When Count Borhis di Salvaress learned the witcher had found his basilisk and - swish! - he was so aggrieved he found a sturdy tree branch and - clunk!
   1197084|00000000||The Caroberta Woods have swallowed up yet more victims… Folk say… they're hauuuuunted! Heheh.
   1197092|00000000||Pigs' trotters! That's quite the tale!
   1197090|00000000||Ehh, there you go scheming again…
   1190609|00000000||You would hit a woman?!
   1190615|00000000||Ooh, the witcher, our hero!
   1190617|00000000||Deadly effective, deadly good looks!
   1190613|00000000||Where's the Guard?! You just stole my heart!
   1190611|00000000||Did you fall for me at first sight, or did it take a time to sink in?
   1190619|00000000||Why so aggressive?!
   1190623|00000000||Salut, clever man!
   1190621|00000000||Hey, hey, hey!
   1153750|25753b28||Ducal Guardsman
   1192431|00000000||All right. Convinced me. Lay 'em out.
   1192428|00000000||Yeah. Let's play.
   1192433|00000000||No thanks. Think I'll pass this time.
   1192435|00000000||Bumbotch. But a no's a no. I'll not insist nor beg. Your loss.
   1193616|00000000||Take care, now.
   1192429|00000000||Not in the mood.
   1110591|00000000||That's rich! De Corentin's dead. Who are you? His brother? His lover? Louis never mentioned either.
   1110597|00000000||Maybe so, but he told me a bit about you. Heard you used to play a little gwent, had a habit, in fact, till your wife helped you kick the addiction. Real treasure, wife like that.
   1110620|00000000||Argh, the bumpoke! Ehh, here I thought I might hang it over the mantle again, with Louis gnawing radishes from the underside. But it seems I must…
   1110625|00000000||So be it, the sword's yours. Uh, but don't leave me high and dry. Give me a chance to win back my dignity, at least. Perhaps a round or three for coin?
   1192500|00000000||What about the wife? Not afraid she'll--?
   1192502|00000000||In my home, what I say stands. Women've got no power. Besides which the wife's away for a few days visiting her sister in Belhaven. So, shall we play?
   1129920|00000000||I've come for Louis' sword.
   1129922|00000000||Here to collect Louis de Corentin's sword.
    496161|99a744ea||Basilisk
    458131|19a6fc60||Guard
   1153222|00000000||Was looking to buy something… maybe sell something, too.
   1153218|00000000||Willing to do a bit of trade?
   1153228|00000000||Time I got back on the Path. So long.
   1153220|00000000||Farewell.
   1153219|00000000||Been in the wine trade long…?
   1153224|00000000||Wine trade - been at it for a while?
   1153226|00000000||Not terribly long, to be candid. I apprenticed to be an alchemist, but proportions were never my strong suit. So I took to trading in wines. More pleasant, I must say - one drinks on the job and no one ever complains.
   1184077|00000000||Makes sense. And the world's always a bit more bearable on a buzz.
   1175353|00000000||Will you help? Or not?
   1175349|00000000||Heard you calling. Wanted to talk?
   1175351|00000000||I did! For we're neck-deep in trouble! Of the spider kind!
   1184081|00000000||Need a maid with a broom, not a witcher.
   1184083|00000000||You fail to understand! These are huge - the size of pigs or dogs. Black and hairy, spewing webs!
   1184085|00000000||Mhh. Not talking about spiders, then. Talking about arachnomorphs.
   1184087|00000000||Call them what you will! You must smash the rogues, will you? Those caves would be prime barrel storage were it not for the beasts…
   1175345|00000000||Arachnomorphs don't look much like bunnies, but they sure breed like them. Best nip the problem in the bud. I'll look into it.
   1175346|00000000||I can take care of that for you.
   1175363|00000000||Any tidings?
   1175365|00000000||None yet. Rest assured, though. It'll all work out.
   1175367|00000000||Need to think about it. Sorry, got a pretty full plate.
   1175347|00000000||Lemme think it over.
   1210173|00000000||My pay - let's talk…
   1210175|00000000||First things first. Need to talk about my reward.
   1210177|00000000||Err, not an amount I can afford. Perhaps a modest reduction, eh?
   1210179|00000000||Not far now. We find ourselves a hair from agreeing.
   1210183|00000000||I knew we would agree terms!
   1210181|00000000||No, no, no! You exaggerate. Take what I offer or I'll find another for the job!
   1175355|00000000||All taken care of. Went inside and cleaned up.
   1175357|00000000||Thank the gods! And you too, of course!
   1153217|00000000||My savior, my spider smasher! How might I be of service?
   1175369|00000000||Hey! Over here, please!
   1172790|00000000||Health! I wish you health!
   1172792|00000000||Yes?
   1198483|00000000||Congratulations on your win in the tourney, witcher.
   1172794|00000000||Oh my, a witcher. He's like to keep us busy…
   1172796|00000000||You cut, we sew…
   1172798|00000000||Watch it!
   1172800|00000000||How can you…?!
   1191232|00000000||Eh…
   1191234|00000000||Woooo… arrrgh…
   1191238|00000000||Crikey.
   1191240|00000000||Eeerrr akh akh akh akh-akh-akh… Argh.
   1191247|00000000||What in the--
   1191236|00000000||That scoundrel playin' cutpurse 'stead o' stickin' to honest beggin'?
   1191243|00000000||Help a poor fellow out!
   1191245|00000000||Alms for the poor?
   1191253|00000000||Heheheh! Akh akh… Hehehe!
   1191249|00000000||Demon!
   1191251|00000000||Aaaa!
   1178491|00000000||Laundry's the most important corner of this coop. Take it away, remove it, we'd be no different from the rats.
   1185625|00000000||Whoa, you get skunked out of your ragshirt playing gwent? Never fear, you'll get you a new one… for a small fee, of course.
   1173764|00000000||Bloody hand print… Mhm. It's his.
   1207896|00000000||Broke the flowerpot when moving the door… then stepped in the soil.
   1189099|00000000||That… that must be Cecilia.
   1173749|00000000||No pulse. We're too late.
   1173751|00000000||He… he slit her throat. The brute…
   1184246|00000000||Hmm. Didn't go out the door, guard would've noticed. Might still be somewhere here…
   1176356|00000000||You must find him before he harms another. I shall alert Orianna at once. She should bring her soirée to a close.
   1173753|00000000||Shouldn't split up.
   1173755|00000000||Geralt, I will be fine. Go after that rogue. I shall fetch help.
   1207898|00000000||Footprints. Made by soiled boots.
   1185562|00000000||Tore down the door, made a platform. Clever. Must be pretty strong, too.
   1173762|00000000||Hm. Killed her, then went out on the balcony.
   1179010|00000000||Does it hurt? Does it? Does it?
   1179012|00000000||Come, geezer! Move it!
   1179008|00000000||Gray, haggard louse!
   1144658|00000000||Yesss?
   1144656|00000000||Do I know you?
   1144660|00000000||Slide that right back where it belongs.
   1144664|00000000||Oh, you'll regret that!
   1144666|00000000||Drop your sword!
   1144662|00000000||Meet my cold steel!
   1144670|00000000||This is Beauclair and everything's peachy!
   1144668|00000000||For watering down wine - the pillory!
   1144672|00000000||You're in Toussaint! Behave yourself!

   1180942|00000000||{A-réir brùi… A-réir fireann.} [Why, you are brutal… You are manly.]
   1180940|00000000||Ah, you there, knight… what is your… crest?
   1180944|00000000||Think before uttering something stupid!
   1180946|00000000||Greetings, stranger.
   1175214|00000000||Is there anything I can do for you?
   1175212|00000000||Yes, witcher?
   1175216|00000000||Better to push quills than drag hoes, don't you think?
   1175218|00000000||Drumming up work for yourself, witcher?
   1181966|00000000||We came here to meet you. Specifically.
   1181968|00000000||To meet… me? But… why?
   1181970|00000000||Cintrian noble you came here with - wanted to ask you about him.
   1181972|00000000||Cintrian noble…? Ahhh, you must think I'm Cecilia!
   1193674|00000000||Orchid, confused me…
   1184188|00000000||I told you not to move!
   1181976|00000000||As she concluded her performance, Cecilia tossed the flower into the crowd, I caught it… but I did see the nobleman.
   1181978|00000000||Really like to talk to him… What'd he look like?
   1181980|00000000||Like many here. Tall, dark, masked…
   1184168|00000000||Know where he might be now?
   1184170|00000000||He gave Cecilia a small gift - a heart-shaped box. Then they strolled off together towards the refreshment tables…
   1184192|00000000||Excuse me - madame, monsieur, I cannot work like this. You must leave. Now.
   1181957|00000000||You Cecilia Bellante?
   1181958|00000000||Lovely portrait.
   1181962|00000000||Wow… Impressive portrait.
   1184142|00000000||I know the style, the stroke - this is Dorian Vilesse!
   1184144|00000000||The gracious lady has heard of me?
   1185582|00000000||I… I've heard Anna Henrietta herself wished you to paint her portrait once.
   1185584|00000000||Ah, at one point the palace chamberlain even wrote to me, but, alas, ultimately refused my terms…
   1185610|00000000||What was the matter?
   1188972|00000000||When he learned I only ever paint nudes, he severed all contact. He said he would not dare offend Her Illustrious Highness with such a proposition.
   1188974|00000000||I've always longed to paint her… Such a shame.
   1188976|00000000||I think… you may still get your chance.
   1181950|00000000||Do not disturb! Shoo! Shoo!
   1184101|00000000||Mhm… it's the right flower.
   1181952|00000000||Of course it is! A Koviri orchid lends just the right contrast to her complexion.
   1181954|00000000||Need to talk to your model. It'll only take a minute.
   1184137|00000000||To me…?
   1181956|00000000||Lie still! You may speak, but for love's sake, do not move!
   1119070|b73cbf23||Hermit
   1124709|49cac332||Prince Anséis
   1182509|00000000||Well? Out with it.
   1182507|00000000||How goes it?
   1182513|00000000||I do what they pay me to do. That's it.
   1182511|00000000||Not even a draft horse will tug without some carrot to move it.
    515159|ca8b0c01||Townswoman
   1196258|00000000||Watch it.
   1196260|00000000||All right…
    346758|c7f8d31d||Guard
   1154422|00000000||Mean me?
   1162998|00000000||Who else?! You are the White Wolf, are you not? You saw my notice, I presume?
   1172444|00000000||I've a rather extraordinary proposition for you.
   1163015|00000000||Need some details before I can say anything. Where're we going, what'm I supposed to do, exactly…?
   1163206|00000000||In the roundest terms, we shall admire the local flora and fauna. And while we do, I might preserve a thing or two.
   1164429|00000000||Preserve?
   1163017|00000000||I've this device, see - a parestisomach. It, uh, it captures, uh, likenesses.
   1163196|00000000||A parisestawhat?
   1163198|00000000||It's like a moveable megascope, capturing moments, transforming them into illusions, based upon which I then paint a painting.
   1163200|00000000||So… you want me with you, looking at animals and flowers and…
   1163202|00000000||That's more or less what it amounts to, yes. Except, you will first have to track down the creatures I wish to capture. I know only the very approximate locations of their habitats.
   1164408|00000000||Well, and should any trouble arise, we'll have your sword at the ready, right? So, agreed?
   1171553|00000000||What's this job entail, exactly?
   1171549|00000000||Need to know who you are. Tell me more.
   1163039|00000000||Count Beledal? Famous poultry farmer - is that it?
   1163041|00000000||Ahem, heheh, that was my grandpapa. Dear man. But my trade is the wine trade - I import the finest vintages to Kovir, my homeland.
   1163043|00000000||The very reason for my frequent visits to Beauclair, during which I like to, hmm, partake of nature, let us say.
   1163045|00000000||Really need a witcher to, uh, partake? Got guards of your own. Take them, save some coin.
   1172530|00000000||I could, surely, but they too deserve a bit of rest, relaxation - right, lads? Besides, I've plenty of coin, coin that needs spending. Who dares stop me?
   1163047|00000000||Ah. So this is about a rich man, bored stiff, seeking thrills.
   1163131|00000000||There's also Clarissa, who--
   1179824|00000000||Vilmar, please…
   1179826|00000000||Who what?
   1179828|00000000||Ehh… my daughter. I always return from my travels with some souvenir or another. She looks forward to them tremendously.
   1179830|00000000||But we did not meet to chat about my family. We must discuss our venture, must we not?
   1172451|00000000||I'm a lover, witcher, of nature, haha! A devotee of the wild, and Toussaint is home to several species not encountered elsewhere.
   1172453|00000000||I'd like you to accompany me on an expedition whose aim is to… hmm, preserve them.
   1172455|00000000||Ahem.
   1172457|00000000||Ah, yes. Naturally, you'll protect me should the need arise. My ever vigilant guards, see, will report any reckless behavior to my wife if I get so much as a scratch. And then woe will be me.
   1172446|00000000||As you've no doubt gleaned from the notice, I've a rather extraordinary proposition for you.
   1186790|00000000||But Count, sir, d'you mean to go off with just this witcher? A right hardy fellow he is, no ponce, I'm sure, but your expedition's too risky on the whole. And not takin' us with you's, pardon my sayin' it, right daft.
   1186794|00000000||You exaggerate, Vilmar. I believe I can manage to survive half a day without someone there to wipe my arse in my stead.
   1186798|00000000||My guards lament, witcher, but you must forgive them. Now, to get down to brass tacks.
   1163002|00000000||Forgive me. I should introduce myself. Count Beledal, a great admirer of your deeds.
   1172351|00000000||Thanks. Not something we witchers hear often.
   1154424|00000000||Greetings.
   1163000|00000000||Greetings to you, White Wolf! I presume you saw my notice? Ah, a foolish question - you are here, thus you must have seen it!
   1171542|00000000||Lads, I find your concern touching, I do. Yet I've long awaited this day. So you must forgive me, but I shall go through with it as planned.
   1163007|00000000||Ah! It seems my guide has arrived!
   1159710|00000000||White Wolf! You're back after all! A change of heart, is it?
   1163342|00000000||Still thinking about it.
   1163344|00000000||You don't deem this witcher work, I know, yet I assure you it shall leave no stain on your honor.
   1163346|00000000||Apart from which, it's a chance at easy coin. Perhaps also a pleasant diversion.
   1163366|00000000||So, how do you see it? Are you in?
   1154432|00000000||My pay - let's talk.
   1154439|00000000||Pretty unusual contract…
   1163247|00000000||I couldn't agree more, yes. And I'm prepared to pay a commensurately high fee.
   1163249|00000000||Don't mind if we actually talk about exactly how high that'll be first, do you?
   1163251|00000000||Why ever would I? Please, simply tell me how much you wish to receive.
   1154443|00000000||Hm. I'm close to agreeing, very, very close… Could you drop it just a bit lower?
   1154441|00000000||Sorry, but that's too much. Even for one like me.
   1154447|00000000||No! Now that's going too far. I believe I was mistaken about you, witcher.
   1163269|00000000||Either take what I offer, or we can forget the whole thing.
   1154445|00000000||Sublime! We've a deal!
   1154437|00000000||Not sure you actually get what it is I do. I'm a professional monster slayer.
   1163317|00000000||Not some guide for nature walks.
   1163319|00000000||Forgive me, master, I meant no offense.
   1163321|00000000||None taken. Just, next time you post a notice for a witcher, at least make sure it's witcher work you've got in mind.
   1163323|00000000||Naturally. Yet should you have a change of heart, whatever the reason, I shall wait here a while longer.
   1154433|00000000||Doesn't sound like a job for me.
   1154431|00000000||I'll take the job.
   1186305|00000000||Doesn't seem hard… Be glad to do something pleasant for a change.
   1177922|00000000||I'm afraid we've to await the morn. Proper light, see, it's very important.
   1177997|00000000||In the meantime, be my guest at my fire, sir. In fact, I'd be delighted to hear some tales of witcher life…
   1178079|00000000||Well, the wide and wild world beckons. The light now is perfect.
   1177920|00000000||Yes, let's. The light seems perfect just now.
   1177906|00000000||Sublime. In that case, here's your map.
   1177908|00000000||Before coming here, I dispatched requests to several local hunters. They located the habitats of the species of interest to me and marked out their ranges on the map.
   1177910|00000000||Good thinking. It'll save us some time, won't need to track. Ready to go?
   1163407|00000000||All in all… why not. You convinced me, let's say.
   1171535|00000000||You make mountains of molehills, Vilmar. I shall be better than fine.
   1172314|00000000||I must insist, Count. You'll be much, much the safer with us at your side.
   1171537|00000000||Balderdash!
   1172316|00000000||Count, if I may. I believe Vilmar's in the right. There's no knowin' what lurks in these wilds.
   1189886|00000000||Oh, you've returned. Splendid! We shall await dawn's superior light and venture out then.
   1206067|00000000||Seems I got the map, so I'll lead.
   1032899|3036a253||Preacher
   1191494|00000000||All right!
   1191486|00000000||Ehhh… Greetings…
   1191488|00000000||Akh akh akh akh akh. What?
   1191490|00000000||Akh akh akh akh akh…

   1181196|00000000||Oh, to be a witcher and not give one hoot about anything…
   1181194|00000000||It's all wrong… Nothing's ever to his liking! Old wet fart…
   1181200|00000000||Sorry.
   1181198|00000000||I'm not permitted to talk to you, sir.
   1165436|00000000||Your place or round the corner in the alley?
   1165434|00000000||Well? What'll it be?
   1193632|00000000||Those vampires left me so afeared, I've not managed to stand to attention all day! Hahaha.
   1165438|00000000||Looking to have the time of your life?

   1162843|00000000||Go stir the pot elsewhere, Graylocks…
   1194589|00000000||I heard you did a jaunt in the joint. Is that true, Graylocks?
   1162847|00000000||Buuuurp! Ugh, blast… I hawked up a bit of sick.
   1162845|00000000||Learn some bleeding culture, Graylocks. You're in Toussaint.
   1162849|00000000||Beat it, twit.
   1162851|00000000||Can you do this? *Frrrrp* Bwahaharahar!!
   1162853|00000000||Pash off! Come here!

   1193400|00000000||You look dapper today.
   1193402|00000000||Hey, what--?
   1193406|00000000||Whaaa…
   1193408|00000000||I beg you… help!
    338912|9f754b64||Blacksmith
   1193432|00000000||To think I never believed in vampires… Then one bit my neighbor's noggin off!
   1165484|00000000||The gods partook of the vine as well!
   1165482|00000000||We've seen the day come when our culture is threatened by the very means of its own cultural reproduction…
   1165488|00000000||Heheheh. Come, come, we must behave!
   1165486|00000000||Sobriety - that's the transitional state.
   1135060|00000000||Head to the top of Lynx Crag. And good luck.
   1119113|00000000||Always chat with 'em before you chop 'em down?
   1151206|00000000||Fee fi fo fum, a bleeding jester has come! I'll set my hound on you, you bum rag…
   1151208|00000000||Whoa, there. Just curious why you were talking to a tree. But all in all, not my concern.
   1151210|00000000||Wait. Hold, now. My dander's up, true, for scoundrels come and laugh at me. But you, you're, uh… well, just what the demon are you?
   1152314|00000000||A witcher. Name's Geralt. So, folk laugh at you because…?
   1135037|00000000||So? Have you time to help Daphne now?
   1138495|00000000||I cannot pay that much . I do not have that much.
   1138497|00000000||Lower, you must go lower. Willing I am to pay, but I've not near that much.
   1150863|00000000||Willing to help, but first I gotta figure out where to start.
   1150865|00000000||No need. I know it all.
   1152454|00000000||Miss Daphne and Sir Gareth shared a terrible and fearsome love for each other. Yet to prove himself worthy of her hand, Gareth was to face the witch of Lynx Crag.
   1152513|00000000||Before Sir Gareth set off for the hill, Miss Daphne gave him her kerchief, a token of her favor.
   1152515|00000000||Lemme guess - he never returned.
   1152517|00000000||He did not. She stood here, day upon day, night upon night, trying to spy him.
   1152519|00000000||Till she sprouted roots and turned into a tree? Wonder why--
   1152521|00000000||I will fecking tell you why - to await the moment when Gareth returns, kerchief in hand! That is the power of love, the power of longing…
   1152525|00000000||So you must scale Lynx Crag, search there for a means to free Daphne! I will give you my book of tales to refer to… And good luck, witcher.
   1150818|00000000||Willing to look into it.
   1150857|00000000||Lemme take a look at the tree.
   1152407|00000000||Careful, now!
   1150809|00000000||Lemme examine the tree.
   1163658|00000000||Got me curious, gotta admit. You really think the old tales're true.
   1163660|00000000||Taking the wee-pee, are you? Do you think me barmy?
   1163662|00000000||No. It's just these're dark, grim times. No room for knights pure of heart or happily-ever-afters. So I don't often run into folk like you.
   1163725|00000000||Yes, true, the times are crudpie. But I see this as all the more reason to remember the tales.
   1163727|00000000||My gran would say, "If you know not what to do, think to the Chessboard Knight and Noble Alondra - and the path they would choose."
   1163729|00000000||She schooled me so thorough in it, I could not do otherwise even if I wished to.
   1163654|00000000||Fond of fairy tales - why?
   1105028|00000000||Interesting case, can't deny it. But I just don't have the time.
   1133362|00000000||You'll be back, witcher. In Herrera's tales you witchers always return.
   1105018|00000000||Don't have time for this.
   1138221|00000000||Let's talk about my reward.
   1138503|00000000||My help doesn't come free, you know.
   1138763|00000000||You speak to a lowly woodcutter. No stench of coin about me.
   1138501|00000000||I have never even seen this much.
   1138499|00000000||Agreed. I will pay - as soon as the young maid is free.
   1167815|00000000||And? Did you look at the tree, close?
   1167817|00000000||Mhm. Actually does bleed. Pretty incredible. Looks… wondrous.
   1167819|00000000||Did I not say so?
   1138223|00000000||So what makes you think there's a girl cursed inside the tree?
   1106186|00000000||Well… I came out with my dog Morholt to cut her down . Axe in hand, a broad swing I took. The edge burrowed deep in her trunk. And bumbotch me if blood didn't spurt forth!
   1119072|00000000||My jaw dropped in the dirt - but right then I knew! Every jot of it in the tale of Daphne, Gareth and the Witch of Lynx Crag!
   1152366|00000000||Don't tell me - from Herrera's "Tales and Fables."
   1152368|00000000||You porking bet! Second edition, amended, in octavo. I know those tales by heart, my nan read them to put me to sleep!
   1138237|00000000||Guess she read it cover to cover, colophon included.
   1152372|00000000||Tree's a cursed girl? What makes you say so?
   1152373|00000000||You believe the tale? Aren’t you a little too old?
   1152385|00000000||Bit too old to believe in bedtime stories, aren't you?
   1152387|00000000||Want your chops busted, witcher? How old I am, that is none of your porking concern.
   1152389|00000000||Fair point - not my business what you believe, either.
   1152391|00000000||Huh. I'm content we see eye to eye.
   1152316|00000000||Hold up. A witcher, you say? Like in Luis Herrera's "Tales and Fables"? Luckier than a green-bleeding leprechaun, I am!
   1152322|00000000||See, not a soul around believes this tree is Daphne, the cursed lady of legend. But you - you could lift the curse!
   1104203|00000000||You Jacob?
   1151204|00000000||Heel, Morholt, down. Who asks?
   1152397|00000000||A witcher. Saw your notice.
   1137222|00000000||Gods be bumpoked, you must hang on, m'Lady!
   1127002|00000000||Stay with me a bit longer, Lady Daphne.
   1151214|00000000||Right lucky thing you showed up.
   1157001|00000000||So? Have you scaled Lynx Crag yet? Know what to do?
   1163656|00000000||Getting to it now. I'm ready.
   1199577|00000000||Well? What did you learn?
   1201832|00000000||Hullo, cheers, howdy-do! In need of anything?
   1201889|00000000||See you.
   1201828|00000000||Take care.
   1201827|00000000||Show me what you got.
   1154701|00000000||Mind if I glance at your stock?
   1154696|00000000||Greetings, monsieur. You need something?
   1201830|00000000||Welcome, Snow White! Wish to look over my goods?
   1205936|00000000||Witcher! Save me!
   1205938|00000000||You save my life, I thank you. Should you need something, find me at the Cockatrice.
   1210059|00000000||This painting, it's rather… it's very…
   1210061|00000000||Bloody colorful, that's what! Haha!
   1210063|00000000||Hrmph. Ignoramus.
   1210065|00000000||A true talent! Paints like the Great Boiles!
   1210067|00000000||The Great Boiles? But… he's a dancer.
   1210069|00000000||Umm… that's to say… the other Boiles! His brother!
   1210051|00000000||It must be someone famous, I tell you. Such talent…
   1210053|00000000||Exceptional, true! My, would I ever love to meet him… It's a shame he didn't come alone.
   1210055|00000000||Need I remind you that neither did you?
   1210057|00000000||Pff.
   1210027|00000000||Purple… Quite the noble color.
   1210029|00000000||Splendid… The sky over Toussaint before a storm.
   1210039|00000000||Or a deeply internalized fear of intimacy.
   1210031|00000000||Gods! Scarlet, crimson, oxblood!
   1210033|00000000||I see lips… Full, sensually parted lips.
   1210035|00000000||I've got it! It's the Sansretour!
   1210037|00000000||It's not a landscape, you pleb! It's a manifestation of the man's soul.
   1210041|00000000||Hiccup! Blue blotch is all I see.
   1210043|00000000||That green! Lush and verdant as a field of vines!
   1210086|00000000||To vines! And to wine!
   1210047|00000000||The composition takes shape!
   1210049|00000000||Yes, it's sure to be a masterpiece.
   1210023|00000000||Yellow? Why ever yellow?!
   1210025|00000000||It's obvious! It represents transgression in its purest form!
   1210017|00000000||This is no game, no diversion. It's a paradigm manifested.
   1210019|00000000||Paradigm, shmaradigm! Throw the damn thing!
   1210021|00000000||Shh! Silence! The artist must focus!
   1195351|00000000||Good toss! It added some depth.
   1195347|00000000||Superb! The composition!
   1195234|00000000||What a toss! What style!
   1210045|00000000||Voilà - fin. Now allow me a moment to ponder.
   1195414|00000000||My appraisal? The painting depicts spiritual dualism. The continual battle between good and evil. And defiance.
   1195238|00000000||Oh, yes, that's him, all right. Good versus evil. The dualistic nature of man.
   1195240|00000000||And defiance.
   1195230|00000000||All have the right to create! Cast some paint balls, discover your artistic soul!
   1198106|00000000||Come and express yourself! Besmirch the canvas and behold your emotions!
   1198108|00000000||Anyone can be an artist! Even you! Come, toss some paint!
   1195228|00000000||An artist naps in each of us! Come, toss a paint ball or two!
   1210100|00000000||Should you tire of these hues, drop them in the pail and grab a different array.
   1210092|00000000||Good sirs, noble ladies, it seems real art requires time.
   1210094|00000000||Clearly, not all are cut out to be artists…
   1210096|00000000||An artist must have stones! Oversized stones!
   1210098|00000000||Pff…
   1210015|00000000||Good folk, yet another soul longing to express its creative side!
   1195232|00000000||Well, well… you and modern art?
   1207108|00000000||Go on, Geralt, be bold! Show us the artist in you! The paint balls - cast them at the canvas!
   1210102|00000000||Wine, wine's what's needed. Wine renders all art digestible. Hiccup!
   1210104|00000000||Rather inspiring, isn't it?
   1210106|00000000||I do hope this soirée concludes more civilly than the last.
   1210108|00000000||You look to me an artist of immense talent.
   1210110|00000000||Artistry through brutality. Pellets that rupture upon striking a canvas. Deeply moving.
   1210112|00000000||Yes? How might I assist you?
   1194732|00000000||Animals!
   1194734|00000000||He-llo...
   1194736|00000000||How are you?
   1194738|00000000||Jackass.

   1126567|00000000||Master witcher! A man of action, a man of valor - are you not?! Would you care to challenge Still Waters?
   1126565|00000000||Who dares to bounce fists with Still Waters?
   1190028|00000000||Mnhhmm.
   1055084|06691856||Peasant
   1154206|00000000||Greetings, sir. What is it you need?
   1185589|00000000||Hm. Had wine on my mind all day.
   1185591|00000000||What kind? Red, white, rosé? Dry, semi-dry, sweet? How heavy? What appellation?
   1185593|00000000||Hmm. I'll need to think about it.
   1154210|00000000||Tell me something about the area?
   1154213|00000000||Tell me something about the area, would you?
   1154215|00000000||Hmm… What's there to tell…? That the master of these lands, Monsieur de Bourbeau, is the greatest buffoon in all Toussaint?
   1185601|00000000||Uh, yeah… Already had the pleasure. Or the pain, more like.
   1185603|00000000||Really? Hm. Thanks. Keep an eye out in that case.
   1188481|00000000||Gwent - maybe we could play a round?
   1188479|00000000||You play gwent?
   1154217|00000000||Time I was on my way. See you.
   1154211|00000000||I'm off.
   1154209|00000000||Show me what you got behind the counter.
   1185599|00000000||Show me what you got behind the counter.
   1154208|00000000||Welcome back! What shall I pour you?
   1184863|00000000||Mama says that if someone's really, but I mean really, really, really bad, it means his heart is made of stone!
   1184865|00000000||Your eyes! They shine! Woooooooow!
   1184861|00000000||The witcher slips through the streets while everyone sleeps…
   1184869|00000000||Heehee!
   1184867|00000000||Heeeey!
   1191586|00000000||I'm but a poor little woman!

   1156549|00000000||Craft something for me? I pay well.
   1156544|00000000||Craft something for me?
   1188493|00000000||Gwent - interested in a round or two?
   1188491|00000000||Care for a game of gwent?
   1156551|00000000||So long.
   1156545|00000000||Farewell.
   1156543|00000000||Show me your wares.
   1156547|00000000||Mind showing me your wares?
   1156542|00000000||Ooooooaaargh… Eh? What's that?
   1199796|b55f08b3||Nazairi Bandit
   1200233|f12a38f5||Dante di Brado
   1152505|00000000||Regis? Regis!
   1152508|00000000||"Land of a Thousand Fables"… Incredible…
   1152511|00000000||Hm. Let's see where this road takes me…
   1207762|00000000||Hmm…. This it? Let's see…
   1208700|00000000||Expecto ludum…
   1176217|00000000||"The Land of a Thousand Fables." Interesting… medallion's vibrating.
   1123463|00000000||Effect of the brew's waning, I can feel it. Won't be able to understand you, soon.
   1127194|00000000||Ehh, shame, that. Shame, too, that we didn't catch that umbra. But lemme tell you one last joke, all right?
   1127196|00000000||This is a killer. Why'd the horse cross the road?
   1127198|00000000||No idea.
   1127200|00000000||Yeehaaahahaha!
   1179997|00000000||Birds all silent for the night,
   1179999|00000000||Cows turned in as daylight dies.
   1180001|00000000||But one soul lies anxious, wide awake,
   1180003|00000000||Fearin' all manner of ghouls, hags and wraiths.
   1176864|00000000||Monster? What monster?
   1176892|00000000||Monster. What monster?
   1176894|00000000||B-b-big… with t-t-teeth and… and…
   1176896|00000000||And what?
   1176898|00000000||This is pointless. Won't tell us anything in his condition.
   1176900|00000000||Speak. What happened here?
   1174583|00000000||Fine… See if I can't find a lead.
   1174585|00000000||Excellent. Go on, get to work.
   1174589|00000000||Come, little one. I'll sing to you.
   1174593|00000000||Wolves asleepin' 'midst the trees, bats all aswayin' in the breeze…
   1176970|00000000||But one soul lies anxious, wide awake, fearin' all manner of ghouls, hags and wraiths…
   1174576|00000000||Fine. See if I can't find a lead.
   1174577|00000000||Boy's wounded.
   1174579|00000000||Boy's hurt. Wounds need dressing.
   1174581|00000000||Not to worry. I'll see to it.
   1176908|00000000||You sure? Got a lot of practice, just need a few minutes to--
   1176910|00000000||Go.
   1176968|00000000||Think I know enough.
   1176912|00000000||As do I. Something killed my children.
   1179892|00000000||I'll stay with the boy. He shouldn't be left alone again. You… you track down this scum. Bring me its head, and I'll help you with the Unseen.
   1176866|00000000||Who's this Arnaud?
   1176868|00000000||The guardian. He ran the orphanage, with his wife… for a generous fee.
   1176870|00000000||I don't see them. Can't hear or smell them, either. They fled. Left the children behind as bait.
   1176872|00000000||Uncle Arnaud told us to be quiet as mice… and the monster wouldn't come.
   1176887|00000000||But it did, it came.
   1174528|00000000||Arnaud - who is he?
   1174527|00000000||What happened then?
   1174546|00000000||What happened then?
   1174548|00000000||Bartez, Nieve, Maura… and some others… they ran out. My sister Anna and me… we hid right here, in the room.
   1174569|00000000||But Anna… she began to cry. I covered her mouth, whispered shhh, shhh, shh… Held her long, till she stopped.
   1176964|00000000||You mean to say you…?
   1176966|00000000||Drop it.
   1176878|00000000||I was so scared… s-s-so sc-scared…
   1176880|00000000||Of what? You can tell us. Take your time.
   1176882|00000000||I… I w-w-woke up because of the bells… then the sc-screams… I pulled my quilt over my head, so I w-wouldn't hear. But… they were so l-loud…
   1176888|00000000||And… something began pounding on the roof… boom, boom, louder and louder. Then Uncie Arnaud came and said… "Sit quiet… real quiet… shhh, shhh… and you'll be all right."
   1176890|00000000||The whoreson abandoned them. Left them and ran away!
   1188887|00000000||Easy, little man. You're safe now.
   1176863|00000000||Relax. You're safe now.
   1174518|00000000||Arnaud?!
   1174520|00000000||P-p-lease. Shh. Ssshhhhh.
   1174524|00000000||What happened? Where's Arnaud? Speak!
   1176862|00000000||Shhh. Or th-th-the m-m-monster will c-c-come.
   1174513|00000000||Must cost a small fortune, maintaining this place.
   1174515|00000000||What can I do? I've a weakness for children.
   1176850|00000000||Meaning?
   1176852|00000000||Meaning that I… Wait. Smell that?
   1176854|00000000||Blood.
   1176856|00000000||Look. The bushes. It's…
   1176858|00000000||Arnaud! Arnaud!!
   1164696|00000000||Shhhh… shhh… shh.
   1164688|00000000||Time is short, witcher.
   1190419|00000000||Long live the duquessa!
   1190417|00000000||Long live the Duchy of Toussaint!
   1198437|00000000||Yes? What?
   1198441|00000000||Say, be you Geralt of Rivia? On your victory in the tourney I congratulate you.
   1198439|00000000||Say, be you Ravix of Fourhorn? On your victory in the tourney I congratulate you.
   1190421|00000000||May history's wheel roll onward.
   1190423|00000000||So fall in lads behind the drum, with colors blazing like the sun, along the road to come-what-may - over the hills and far away!
   1190425|00000000||You call those manners? You call that decent behavior?
   1190431|00000000||You're fast, demon's spawn!
   1190429|00000000||Dog's dangling grapes!
   1190427|00000000||Hurrah!
   1214835|00000000||<i>How doth the little wild boar<br>Improve his shining tusks,<br>And rut them ‘gainst the forest floor,<br>And on the trees’ rough husks!<br><br>How cheerfully he seems to grin<br>How neatly spreads his claws,<br>And welcomes little lasses in,<br>With gently smiling jaws!</i><br>Louis of Charolle, mathematician, author and poet<br><br>These woodland beasts are as “wild” – untamed, nasty and aggressive – as their name indicates. To this day, many peasants in outlying Kaedweni villages believe wild boars persist on a diet of young maids, though in truth they most often slate their hunger with roots and acorns. Do not think this vegetarian diet makes them harmless, however. In fact, these animals’ stout build and sharp teeth render them veritable fur-covered combat machines. Mother Nature has additionally equipped them with dual pairs of tusks - upper "pipes" and lower "sabres" - and this weaponry's sum effect is to make the beasts the terrors of the woods, a threat to all who venture or dwell there, human, humanoid and otherwise. Boars also have hard, club-like snouts, which some peasants call their “whistles,” though no boar has ever been heard to make such a noise. Instead, they emit a characteristic grunt, which sounds to some like the snoring of an extremely overweight man. Another peasant belief claims boars have extremely prickly natures, and, if offended, will vent their anger by knocking down fences and gobbling up potatoes. Though they sometimes live alone, boars usually appear in small groups of 3 to 5 specimens.<br>
   1214836|00000000||Boars move with lightning speed and can attack a foe from the rear with a powerful kick of their hind hooves and slice those coming at them from the front with their sharp tusks. A wise strategy is to catch a boar (or boars, if fighting a pack and the possibility arises) in an Yrden trap, or to set alight their fur with the Igni Sign.
   1214837|00000000||Wild Boars
   1162755|00000000||Don't hit me!
   1162753|00000000||Yes, sir?
   1192848|00000000||No doubt it rained gold for you after you killed the Beast… Spare me a sprinkle?
   1162757|00000000||Aid a miserable pauper!
   1162759|00000000||Breeeeeeead!
   1162905|00000000||Cursed are the greedy, for fire shall devour them!
   1162142|00000000||Nekkers? Look like they made off with the paints. Question is, why.
   1177628|00000000||So you Nordlings only drink beer? Not a drop of wine? Ever?
   1177630|00000000||Slake those that thirst! Feast those that hunger! Thus spake the holy Prophet Lebioda!
   1177632|00000000||The Prophet Lebioda keep you from hangovers!
   1177634|00000000||All righty, the poison du jour, what shall it be?
   1177535|00000000||You've to move your little camp elsewhere, got it?! This is a decent district, we need no filthfolk bumming about!
   1177537|00000000||Gentlemen, there's no need to raise your voices. Let's keep our calm…
   1177539|00000000||Our calm is exactly what you disturb! Your vagrants bring pestilence, take work from honest folk and sponge off ducal relief!
   1177541|00000000||My folk do not harm a soul. And they've nowhere else to go.
   1183999|00000000||We don't give a flying fart!
   1185279|00000000||Ehh… Love, youth, adventure…
   1185277|00000000||I once had a girl, or should I say… she once had me?
   1185281|00000000||You've no idea how I envy you!
   1185283|00000000||Yes, son?
   1189751|00000000||Now to activate the portal, see where it drops me.
   1189759|00000000||Moreau - yet another piece of his story.
   1190769|00000000||Hmm… Back of the diagram, Jerome made a note.
   1202332|00000000||Wonder what happened at Mont Crane?
   1201352|00000000||So the witcher was taken somewhere via portal.
   1201440|00000000||Must be that ruined fort Lafargue mentioned. Worth a look.
   1201442|00000000||Abandoned castle mired in a dark legend - dream hideout for bandits.
   1201444|00000000||Moreau kept Jerome here. Need to look around.
   1205706|00000000||Moreau eventually came to terms with his son being a witcher.
   1201354|00000000||Hm, Jerome was Moreau's son. Be nice to know the full story.
   1206112|00000000||Ehh, a grim tale. But I came for the diagrams. Should be somewhere around here.
   1189749|00000000||Can't activate the portal until I find the missing crystal.
   1201834|00000000||One hundred forty-three, carry the two…
   1201836|00000000||Fiddlesticks, these numbers don't add up the way I'd like…
   1201838|00000000||Coddlesocks and blunderbass… I paid too much out again…
   1194512|00000000||You seek someone?
   1194514|00000000||Well, well…
   1194516|00000000||No point complainin'.
   1189567|00000000||I saw that witcher slaughter the shaelmaar. A fine display of skill if I ever saw one.
   1196574|00000000||But that is all they know how to do. They've this course, the Gauntlet, they call it - it's where they learn all their tricks.
   1196576|00000000||Do I detect a note of jealousy?
   1196578|00000000||I'm not jealous, merely stating facts. And it's a shame he slew the shaelmaar. I heard a mate for it was on its way here.
   1196580|00000000||And I heard the other shaelmaar wreaked havoc on the ship they were hauling it in. Ship, crew and shaelmaar all went to the bottom.
    167646|fdda75c1||Rotfiend
   1179122|00000000||I'll give it a go from the right!
   1179124|00000000||What? Curses!
   1195568|00000000||I can't believe it… I can't believe this mangled muff minder smashed Fourfingers' hanse…
   1179128|00000000||And now, blood shall flow…
   1179130|00000000||Let the blood flow! Flow like wine!
   1179132|00000000||You weary me, gray gullet.
   1179126|00000000||Is that eau de cadavre you're wearing…?
   1179134|00000000||We cannot let him get away!
   1179136|00000000||Oh, burndyducks! I despise sorcery.
   1194225|00000000||How's your health?
   1194227|00000000||Greetings.
   1194229|00000000||Well, what are you looking at?
   1194231|00000000||Bloody hell.
   1194233|00000000||Someone, get help!
   1208424|d0ac850d||Ghostly Knight
   1208876|7989db55||Bon Vivant
   1188839|00000000||Off you go! Get!
   1188837|00000000||Shoo!
   1200668|00000000||Liam and Matilda made war for ages. Now they make love!
   1188841|00000000||Bum-ploughed sorcerer, like to be planning to witch our kids away!
   1188843|00000000||Beware, all! The witchman cometh!
   1125455|00000000||Are you ready? May we go?
   1125382|00000000||Sir Geralt of Rivia did not give his best! He failed, missed his marks and did not pass the test!
   1125384|00000000||Sir Ravix has lost! What a surprise! Could he be cursed? Or… or an imp in disguise?
   1125380|00000000||Horm Akerspaark wins – yet are those tears in his eyes? Perhaps his heart yearns for a lover’s soft sighs.
   1173166|00000000||Your prize, sir. A crossbow adorned with your crest. I congratulate you.
   1173168|00000000||Thank you, my Lady.
   1125392|00000000||Sir Geralt of Rivia has trounced his foe! Pounded him soundly, immersed him in woe!
   1125390|00000000||Sir Ravix has won, his bolts struck the goal, yet even this cannot soothe the ache in his soul!
   1188551|00000000||What are the other prizes?
   1188554|00000000||Would you tell me about the other prizes?
   1188558|00000000||Alas, I cannot devote more time to you than to the other combatants. I have duties to attend to. Forgive me.
   1188552|00000000||Medallion hums when you're near.
   1188556|00000000||My medallion's vibrating, strongly. Can only mean one thing - magic.
   1208517|00000000||The explanation is disappointing, I'm afraid. The fragrance I use, it's mixed by a sorceress.
   1188560|00000000||To lose to an opponent such as you is a victory of its own. Accept my congratulations as well.
   1188562|00000000||Thanks.
   1211289|00000000||Blast that kind of luck…
   1210154|00000000||Good work!
   1125419|00000000||In the interim I managed to determine which tent Lady Vivienne occupies.
   1125421|00000000||Perhaps you could find a clue within it.
   1125423|00000000||You're right - Vivienne's cursed in some way. Sensed it when she opened the tourney.
   1134656|00000000||In that case, we've no time to lose. Let us go.
   1125464|00000000||Yeah, let's go now.
   1125434|00000000||Let's do it now.
   1125435|00000000||Need a minute.
   1125466|00000000||Give me a minute. Need to catch my breath.
   1156440|00000000||Welcome back!
   1201159|00000000||Vineyard seems a bit run down.
   1201169|00000000||Master Liam doesn't seem a diligent proprietor…
   1201171|00000000||He tries as best he can! It's not his fault our vineyard's suffered plague upon plague…
   1201173|00000000||Plagues? What kind?
   1201175|00000000||Well, the enormous, yellow, man-eating sundews, for instance! You cannot set foot into the brush for fear of coming out a head shorter.
   1156444|00000000||Thanks, see you later.
   1156442|00000000||Farewell.
   1156441|00000000||Show me your wares.
   1156446|00000000||Show me what you got.
   1200896|00000000||Here we are. Once again, I thank you for the rescue! Wish to look over my stock?
   1201167|00000000||Geralt! You did it - you managed to reconcile Coronata and Vermentino! Incredible! Master Liam has asked me to give you the best prices!
   1199664|00000000||Thank you again for the rescue! Look for me at the Coronata should you pass by.
   1201897|00000000||Lead the way, right behind you.
   1200893|00000000||Let's go.
   1201899|00000000||Need to look around here some more. But I'll be sure to stop by if I'm ever in the area.
   1201901|00000000||I shall be waiting.
   1200894|00000000||Got something else to do here.
   1200892|00000000||Thank you, noble knight! I'd ventured north in search of herbs for a new flavored wine, when suddenly…
   1201161|00000000||Calm down, it's over.
   1201163|00000000||The bungdiddlers kidnapped me - in hopes of collecting a ransom, I'm sure. But with Master Liam's troubles, he never could have paid them.
   1201165|00000000||Ah, but I'm free and safe! Thanks to you! Should you need any herbs, I've a hearty stock at the Coronata. Will you walk me there?
   1206173|00000000||Help! Sir! Save me!
   1093699|00000000||Done. Now where you got those cards?
   1093701|00000000||Leave the city through the Coopers' Gate, then veer right. Our house is easily recognized - a tree adorns the sign above the door. I buried the chest in the garden, beneath the rose bush.
   1111296|00000000||Tree on a sign, rose bush - think I got it.
   1111298|00000000||Might I ask… what you did with Louis? True, he knew nothing in life but gwent, but I would still prefer he not spend eternity in a ditch or a privy.
   1111300|00000000||Don't worry about it. Found him a nice place. Oughta feel right at home. Farewell.
   1135336|00000000||Lebioda, forget'st not my husband, though he be an incorrigible sinner.
   1160946|00000000||No, wait! Ah. If you truly must do this, then please, at the least, deposit me somewhere pleasant.
   1160948|00000000||All the same to me. Where do you wanna go?
   1160950|00000000||Take me to my mother's grave. It's in the old cemetery, just outside the city walls. A lovely spot, almost on the lakeshore. The flora there - it's extraordinary, really.
   1177756|00000000||Hm, extraordinary flora. Where is it exactly?
   1177758|00000000||Beneath the outspread arms of a chestnut. The tombstone bears my mother's name - Micheline Belrose. To think I failed to heed her when she warned me about that lout…
   1209480|00000000||Here in Beauclair, all's right and fair!
   1209478|00000000||The duquessa's champion… Ptooey.
   1209476|00000000||Were I in your boots, I'd go far away. Your protectress is no longer around.
   1209482|00000000||We've got to go at him together! Together!
   1209488|00000000||I'll tear your legs from your bum!
   1209486|00000000||Mutant!
   1209490|00000000||Damned. wandering gray-haired pee-pee-licker!

   1213763|00000000||The fifth transport was to have arrived by boat. It had been expected at its destination quite some time past, so Geralt, a bad feeling rising in his gut, set off in the direction of the boat landing to investigate what had happened.<br>
   1213764|00000000||The witcher's suspicions proved entirely warranted, for bandits had managed to board the boat and restrain the entire crew. They would in fact have  been in dire straits if not for Geralt. He arrived on board just as the bandits were beginning to unload the cargo. The witcher was forced to fight, but once he had defeated them, he freed the sailors.<br>
   1214142|00000000||We are all familiar with the buccaneers of the high seas, but pirates prowling deep inland? That's a relatively unknown phenomenon. Not to Geralt, though, for he came across a group of bandits who had attacked a moored ship, taken its entire crew captive and intended to loot the goods they had been transporting.
   1214143|00000000||The witcher didn't hesitate a moment. He threw himself into battle and defeated the pirates, then freed the sailors they had taken captive. As it turned out, this was all in service of a worthy cause, for the ship had been hauling materials necessary for the completion of the Prophet Lebioda's statue.

   1197046|00000000||I heard someone say a certain Nilfgaardian appeared at Orianna's last… what was his name… Aep Banx!
   1197048|00000000||And if you can imagine, he said he wished to cover all her walls with paintings! Like some primitive human! Or an elf!

   1164115|00000000||Yeah… I'm a wild and crazy guy.
   1171656|00000000||Why not, if I'm in the area…
   1171658|00000000||Splendid. In that case, I shall see you at my lodgings. I'm staying with a friend while in Toussaint, near a village named Francollarts.
   1172666|00000000||I'll be by. See you.
   1171652|00000000||Sure, why not.
   1171668|00000000||Thanks for the invitation, but don't wait up. Got more than a few of my own matters to tend to.
   1171670|00000000||I understand. Yet should you change your mind, just come see me. I'm staying with a friend, near a village named Francollarts.
   1172670|00000000||All right, if I'm in the area. Farewell.
   1171654|00000000||Not my sort of thing. So long.
   1171649|00000000||I've one other matter I wished to broach.
   1171651|00000000||In a few day's time, I shall exhibit my work for some friends, my coterie, so to speak. Would you come by?
   1160281|00000000||I was dead chuffed to be able to observe you in action, to confirm for myself there that the tales about you were not exaggerated in the slightest. You showed discipline, reliability, responsibility.
   1160283|00000000||I daresay you'd make the ideal business associate. It's a shame you've no interest in the wine trade.
   1164102|00000000||One day, maybe.

   1179856|00000000||Excursions he makes now, or rather the paintin's he brings home - they's her only window on the wider world.
   1179915|00000000||Sorry to make you wait.
   1179893|00000000||No need to thank me. Gladly have more contracts like this.
   1179895|00000000||Count's a wonder, ain't he. It's a sad injustice the misfortune that's touched the family.
   1179897|00000000||Misfortune?
   1179868|00000000||My pleasure, really.
   1177932|00000000||Returning your lord to you - safe and sound.

   1176565|00000000||In the charming fairytale duchy for which Toussaint commonly passes, love blooms and erupts into flames faster than in any other corner of the known world. I know what I say, for I too experienced my share of beautiful, passionate moments there, with the painfully lovely Duchess Anarietta, no less...<br>But to return to Geralt's adventures, he agreed to assist a young knight with his troubles in relation to a striking young lady-in-waiting named Vivienne. The youth, lacking experience in love's games, its ruses and deceits, was feverish and suspected that the lofty and inaccessible object of his love might have fallen victim to an evil spell. Wishing to help the youth get to the bottom of the matter, the witcher agreed to enter the lists and take part in the tourney's assorted challenges.<br>
   1176566|00000000||In observance of tradition, the witcher had to reveal a name to take part in the tourney. He chose the immensely original moniker "Geralt of Rivia."<br>
   1176567|00000000||In observance of tradition, the witcher had to reveal a name to take part in the tourney. He chose the pseudonym he used occasionally - Ravix of Fourhorn.<br>
   1176568|00000000||While playing knight, Geralt did not dare neglect his witcherly duties. He spied on Vivienne and followed her to a forest glade, where he discovered her secret. The woman had been cursed while still in her mother's womb. Touched by moonlight, she transformed into a bird.<br>Geralt offered to help her, to lift the curse that held her. Yet he warned Vivienne that the ritual to break the spell could have dire consequences.<br>
   1176569|00000000||Aided by Guillaume, Geralt performed a ritual that was to lift the curse from Vivienne and transfer it to another. Though the witcher doubted it could be effective, the rite worked and the curse passed to the young knight who had valiantly agreed to shoulder its burden. It brings a tear to the eye to think how a seemingly superficial fascination for a woman's beauty can take a turn even more beautiful...<br>
   1176570|00000000||Geralt performed a ritual aimed at reversing the curse that held Vivienne. He had warned her beforehand that it could result in shortening her remaining life to but a handful of years - the number lived on average by an oriole, the egg of which the witcher used during the ritual.<br>Vivienne had acknowledged this possible consequence and stated that she would be grateful to Geralt. For it was through his efforts that she could finally taste a normal life unfettered by the need to conceal her "defect."<br>
   1176571|00000000||Passed to Guillaume, the curse seemed much weakened, its symptoms far less powerful than those that had troubled Vivienne. When Geralt happened upon the couple some time later in Toussaint, they looked happy and in love. This only serves to confirm my observation regarding the unusual aura that seems to hover over the duchy. It almost inspires one to exclaim, "They lived happily ever after!"<br>
   1176572|00000000||Freed of the curse that had held her since birth, Vivienne resolved to take full advantage of life over the few years that possibly remained to her. A time after the events in Toussaint, Geralt happened upon the young woman in Novigrad. She had come there to visit this "largest city in the known world" and now sought a ship upon which she might sail to the Skellige Isles.<br>
   1213942|00000000||Tradition has sanctified two codes of conduct in Toussaint: the teachings of the Prophet Lebioda and the chivalric principles which guide its knights. These latter call for young men to prove their abilities through feats of daring during tourneys. One such knight, Guillaume, sought to stand out from the rest by fighting a shaelmaar and was injured as a result.<br><br>Afterwards, he pleaded with Geralt to visit him in the medics' tent. He said he had a very urgent matter to discuss.<br>
   1214489|00000000||Geralt was torn away from the tourney’s entertainments by the vampires’ attack. All able hands were needed to fend off this threat, meaning Toussaint’s menfolk could no longer dabble in artificial feats of bravery and staged fights.<br>Consumed by his battle against Dettlaff, Geralt had no chance to talk to Vivienne and never learned what secret she hid, assuming she hid one at all, and the whole affair was not just the product of a young lover’s imagination… These can be exceptionally fertile and prone to error, as I know very well myself, being both a lover and young, at least at heart.<br>
   1214490|00000000||Geralt came across Guillaume’s corpse in the city. It seemed the young knight had found bravely against the vampires before ultimately dying while defending his city.<br><br>Thus death won out over love, which unfortunately can happen even in Toussaint.<br>As I write these words I tip a glass of Est Est in honor of the poor young man… So what, that I didn’t know him -- Geralt said he was fine fellow, decent and true.<br>And that’s enough for me.

Other times, however, it can be surprisingly eventful, as a certain Gaston, a simple merchant from Toussaint, learned for himself when he happened across a mortally  wounded man by the roadside. Though he provided aid as quickly as he could, the mysterious man soon bled to death. Right as he did, up walked the hero of my tale, Geralt.<br>
   1173339|00000000||This story had a surprising finale. They discovered the massacre had been committed by.... elven statues. Durand had purchased these a few weeks prior. They were in truth golems, meant to be part of a trap set by the last elven ruler of Toussaint, Divethaf, to take out his vanquisher and tormentor, King Ludovic. Divethaf's trap was never sprung, so his golems slept through the centuries, undisturbed until Durand repeated a formula during an act of historic reconstruction and they awoke...<br>
   1197587|00000000||Zoltan liked to repeat a certain saying: all you can get for free's a punch in the teeth. Geralt must have marked those wise words and decided since no one was paying him to investigate the matter, he was under no obligation to go out of his way to look into it. He thus left the corpse where he had found it and rode off into the sunset...<br>
   1173337|00000000||Though Geralt usually works alone, he made an exception in this case and agreed to let Gaston accompany him. Together they set off following the dead man's tracks towards a residence in which all seemed calm and quiet. Yet once they entered, they found overturned tables, cracked dishes and... more bodies. Luckily, the owner of the villa, Durand Faucher-Plamondon de Savarin, had survived the massacre and was able to tell them what had happened. It seemed Durand and his companions from the Society of Friends of the History of Toussaint had accidentally summoned some kind of monster. Geralt knew his duty was to draw the beast there again and exterminate it before it could shed more blood.<br>
   1181727|00000000||Though many find it hard to believe, witchers can catch the scent of blood from over a league away. It thus comes as no surprise that, one day as he traveled in Toussaint, Geralt departed from the beaten path towards a seemingly peaceful residence. When he found bloody marks on its locked doors, he began investigating...<br>
   1208386|00000000||Upon hearing Gaston's account, Geralt decided this was not a job for a witcher and went on his way.<br>
   1208387|00000000||Eventually, however, he changed his mind and decided to investigate the matter after all.<br>

   1162619|00000000||Medallion's humming. Something's not quite right.
   1093660|00000000||That oughta do.
   1096253|00000000||So, noise is coming from here.
   1160976|00000000||Place Margot mentioned.
   1093721|00000000||Ah, just like she said.
   1181092|00000000||Sign with a tree on it, eh? Well, let's look around.
   1161212|00000000||Removed the urn with Margot's ashes. Just like you wanted. Louis? You there?
   1177586|00000000||"Micheline Belrose." This is it.
   1161174|00000000||Well, that's done.
   1093723|00000000||Under the rose bush… all right.
   1151250|00000000||Deeper in the catacombs… Right, let's go.
   1206040|00000000||Made a hell of a lot of noise. Someone willing to pay me for resolving the problem?
   1210005|00000000||Shoulda known he'd stand me up. All right, if that's how you want to play it…
   1183626|00000000||Right. High time Margot paid up.

   1093715|00000000||Need to go around.
   1184062|00000000||Aaaand the gwent cards. As promised.
   1177572|00000000||So where's the grave? Under a chestnut, or so Margot claimed.
   1178575|00000000||Loud enough to wake the dead.
   1181088|00000000||"Private Chamber - The Right Honorable Members of the Gwent Friendship Society of Beauclair." This is it.
   1093717|00000000||Hm, not here.
   1129994|00000000||Suspiciously loud for a cemetery at night.
   1096256|00000000||No sign of monsters or grave robbers… Bit of a mess, that's all.
   1153752|00000000||Maybe this isn't the spot after all. Strange.
   1093713|00000000||Tree on the sign. Must be the house.

   1204776|00000000||In the duchy of wine there is nothing more important than this noblest of beverages. And when two important winemaking families began to quarrel over which would assume control of one of the duchy's oldest vineyards, all knew sparks would fly… Fully aware of the circumstances, Geralt nonetheless decided to help Matilda Vermentino deal with the troubles at her vineyard, even if this meant making Liam de Coronata his foe.<br>
   1204777|00000000||The witcher had helped, and the Vermentino Vineyard could bloom again. To the ducal clerk, this was proof Matilda was an able steward. He now believed she would also manage Belgaard well.<br>
   1204778|00000000||The witcher dawdled in tending to the Vermentino Vineyard's problems. Alas for Matilda, who lost her chance to take over Belgaard, the title to which would now go to her rival, Liam de Coronata.<br>
   1204780|00000000||While tending to the problems at Vermentino, Geralt had found proof that a third party was behind the troubles there. He realized this knowledge could be valuable to Matilda and Liam, and decided to share it with them both.<br>Yet again his intuition did not fail him. Coronata's and Vermentino's owners realized they could gain by joining forces and possibly lose much by continuing to quarrel. They resolved from that day forward to cooperate - more, to form a consortium.<br>
   1204779|00000000||It was not easy, but the witcher managed to resolve the troubles plaguing the Vermentino Vineyard. Pleased with a job well done, he headed back to Matilda to collect his pay.<br>
   1211299|00000000||Geralt concluded that it would be unfair of him to help Matilda alone while leaving poor Liam out in the cold. Thus he decided to resolve the problems that Liam claimed had appeared at the Coronata Vineyard. With this accomplished and with the ducal clerk doing some prodding of his own, the two young vintners concluded they would benefit more from striking up an alliance than from continuing their feud. Thus they formed a consortium and continued to produce wines under a single enterprise name.

   1093192|00000000||Not true. Look, grass is trampled. Someone's picked flowers here recently. Need to look around.
   1093425|00000000||I shall wait here. Hm, a rhyme for "Duchess"… Something elegant… "Fruit most luscious"?
   1111341|00000000||A basket of flower petals. Same smell as the pomade…
   1093198|00000000||Someone was led through here…
   1093200|00000000||I hope Jean-Louis has suffered something appropriately epic.
   1163853|00000000||There! Jean-Louis' basket! I'd recognize it anywhere! He was here, we can be certain now!
   1201671|00000000||Behold, the location from the map.
   1206653|00000000||Aaa! Geralt! Kill it!
   1206655|00000000||No! Stay away! You'll draw it towards me!
   1200522|00000000||Don't leave me here!
   1200520|00000000||Geraaaaalt! Come back!
   1200524|00000000||Oh, you naughty boy, scaring poor Le Papillon like that. But it's all right. Back to our investigation.
   1206877|00000000||Ground's made of rock, trail's gone cold. Wandered deeper into the cave.
   1206684|00000000||Bidding them farewell, the gravestones moss-covered, they strode briskly on, by doubts unencumbered.
   1206686|00000000||Uuughhh…
   1145741|00000000||My, a dark so dark as to prod one to fear…
   1145743|00000000||Fear uninspiring? No rhymes at the ready?

   1093612|00000000||And all for the glory of Her Grace, the Duchess!
   1201380|00000000||I dedicate this ballad to the memory of our stately… no, our magnanimous and gracious ruler…
   1107806|00000000||I dedicate this ballad to our stately… no, our magnanimous and gracious ruler…
   1107808|00000000||… a tale glory-strewed! Of a missing friseur and a witcher most lewd! No, that's not right.
   1093614|00000000||And all… ahem. And all for the glory of Her Grace, the Duchess!
   1093194|00000000||Grass is trampled. Multiple sets of footprints… a little blood.
   1206879|00000000||Seems you were right. He ran into trouble.
   1106134|00000000||Phew, what luck. I just hope it's not cyclopes. Hard pressed to find a rhyme for that.
   1206881|00000000||Grass is trampled. Multiple sets of footprints… a little blood. Someone attacked him.
   1206680|00000000||They ventured beyond walls by vines entwined, into the unknown, the poor barber to find.
   1206682|00000000||Gonna do that the whole way?
   1093162|00000000||Oh no! Foul bandits have bound our stylist in chains! Little do they know they'll be punished, in pain.
   1206647|00000000||Quiet down!
   1163884|00000000||Oh! Here! Here! This looks just like a clue!
   1163866|00000000||A clue! I think I've found one!
   1164906|00000000||No, no, seems not.
   1206690|00000000||No piece of the stylist fell from its bowels, the friseur had been nabbed by ought else most foul.
   1206688|00000000||The witcher's blade flashed, juices spouted and poured, covering all about in an archespore's gore.
   1206678|00000000||Seidhe Llygad shone in its azure glow, sand marking time's lackadaisical flow.
   1106110|00000000||What beast was that?
   1106112|00000000||An archespore.
   1106114|00000000||Might there be more nearby?
   1106116|00000000||Who knows.
   1164896|00000000||And your sharpened senses, what do they say?
   1164898|00000000||That you'd rather turn and run.
   1164900|00000000||Hahaha, a primo jest! Let us continue onward. I know you'll stand in my defense. You will, will you not?
   1163886|00000000||So? On his trail yet, are you?
   1107336|00000000||Ah, you're here! I believe I've found Jean-Louis, our friseur! Now you must merely save his hide.
   1107338|00000000||But you must take the fore, agreed?
   1174017|00000000||Milton introduced me already.
   1174026|00000000||Like Milton said, I've come from the North at the duchess' behest to deal with the Beast.
   1174028|00000000||Yes, yes, but who are you? A knight? A mercenary? A soldier?
   1174030|00000000||Geralt is a witcher, a master of his trade. He has questions for you about the Beast's most recent victim.
   1174123|00000000||Thanks for the hospitality. Time I examined the corpse.
   1174125|00000000||Corvo Bianco lies a short way from here, near the tourney grounds. Just follow the road and you'll arrive.
   1174127|00000000||Not coming with…? Oh yeah, duty of some sort calls.
   1174129|00000000||"Some sort" - hah! Her Grace bestowed a great honor on me even before we departed for Velen. I'm to play the Hare during this year's game in the palace gardens. When you see me in my costume, you will wet yourself laughing!
   1193689|00000000||A little tempted to ask a few questions, but it sounds like a long, complicated story. One involving lengthy digressions into local history and tradition… So, see you later, Milton. And good luck.
   1174094|00000000||I'll go examine the body.
   1174098|00000000||So folk think the Beast's divine punishment.
   1174100|00000000||Knights have turned their backs on the old customs. Where they were defenders of the duchy, they're now defenders of their own tushes…
   1174102|00000000||Why, you insolent…!
   1174104|00000000||Let him talk.
   1174106|00000000||The duchess trades in titles, grants honors to ill-doers. We've strayed from the path of virtue, lost the gods' favor, so the gods sent retribution.
   1174108|00000000||Don't listen to that nonsense, Geralt. It's rehashed street preacher codswallop.
   1174110|00000000||Yes, the rabble-rousers have been sprouting up like weeds lately. Each offering the same bill of goods.
   1174095|00000000||Folk're saying the Beast's divine punishment?
   1174096|00000000||What else do people say about the Beast?
   1174112|00000000||They say anything else about the Beast? Besides it being a messenger of the gods.
   1174114|00000000||The Toussaintois are no fools. They see clearly the Beast kills on days honoring patron saints.
   1174116|00000000||Picky monster.
   1174073|00000000||Need to examine the body. Know where they took it?
   1174075|00000000||They ferried it across, then loaded it on a cart and hauled it to a cellar at Corvo Bianco. To keep it cool, see.
   1174077|00000000||What? Why, Corvo Bianco is Baron Rossell's estate! When he learns they've turned his cellar into a morgue, he'll set his hounds on them!
   1174079|00000000||While you were gallivanting about the North, his vineyard was auctioned off.
   1174093|00000000||Who was that? Woman who just left? Didn't see her before, didn't notice her walk in, either.
   1174081|00000000||Doubtless Linnice - the innkeep's daughter. But hold, Geralt, because this is an outrage. Rossell's vineyard was auctioned off?! Inconceivable!
   1174083|00000000||It is no secret the baron had gambling debts up to his ears. It finally came time to collect - his creditors auctioned off his property. The Ducal Chancellery bought it, in fact. Rossell now bunks with his brother in Vicovaro.
   1174085|00000000||I told Rossell he'd get his comeuppance. How long can one draw on past heroics?! His creditors must finally have divined that his promises meant nothing.
   1174087|00000000||Such are the times. Today's knights are pale shadows of the heroes of yore.
   1174089|00000000||It's true what they say - gods sent the Beast to punish us for straying from the old paths!
   1174039|00000000||Victim's body - where'd they take it?
   1174040|00000000||Sky was red… then what?
   1174042|00000000||Must've been early in the morning. Went to check your nets and then…?
   1174044|00000000||I stepped out of my hut and saw…
   1174046|00000000||By my troth! To the point, man! You found a body ensnared in your crayfish nets. We know this already. What happened then?!
   1174050|00000000||Did you see anyone nearby? Did you spy anything noteworthy? Anything at all?
   1174052|00000000||Not a soul around, just me. As for noteworthy… hmm… well…
   1174054|00000000||What did you see? But be warned - if I hear the sky was red again…
   1174056|00000000||I saw… a head, bobbing - eyes bulging, the tongue blue and popped out. Next to it, a hand rocking upon the water.
   1174058|00000000||Get a good look at the body parts?
   1174060|00000000||They gave me such a fright, I bolted to town fast as my legs would take me, then returned with guardsmen who told me to keep out of their way.
   1175983|00000000||They had a hard haul. The parts were so tangled up in my nets, they were forced to cut them.
   1174036|00000000||I was the one to find the corpse. The sun had just risen when I awoke, sat straight up in my bed, looked out the window and beheld a sky red as blood--
   1174038|00000000||Ask, Geralt, please. Or we shall be here till winter.
   1174020|00000000||Name's Geralt.
   1174022|00000000||A humble introduction. You've clearly not tarried long with Sir de Peyrac-Peyran.
   1174024|00000000||Spare us the petty insults. Geralt is a master of the witchering trade. He has questions concerning the Beast's last victim.
   1174016|00000000||I'm Geralt.
   1173929|00000000||By my troth! Could that be the musty scent of fresh pâté?
   1173931|00000000||Naught else, Sir de Peyrac-Peyran. I see time has not dulled your senses.
   1174151|00000000||We would be honored if you would join us. Your companion as well.
   1173933|00000000||But why do I not detect even a whiff of crayfish chowder?
   1173935|00000000||No soup today, on account of there being no crayfish. I reckon you've not heard, but all I caught was a corpse! I awoke at the crack of dawn, as I do each day, but when I looked up, I beheld a blood red sky…
   1173937|00000000||This corpse is precisely why we're here. For the man whom you've invited to join you at the table was summoned from a far-off land by Her Gracious Magnificence. He is tasked with tracking and killing the Beast.
   1174015|00000000||We invited two men to join us, yet since Sir de Peyrac-Peyran in temperament is more akin to hare than hound, I surmise the other is the hunter. With whom do we have the pleasure?
   1184998|00000000||I shall be off once I finish my pâté.
   1185002|00000000||I'd rather have that chowder.
   1185004|00000000||The cook has worked wonders, as always.
   1185000|00000000||A well-composed pâté, I must admit.
   1053455|b9aef875||Medic
   1182412|00000000||Whoa, whoa! Calm now!
   1182418|00000000||Our brave guardsmen took on the vampires, defended the town with their own breasts! And bellies!
   1182420|00000000||Well, Graylocks! You sure tucked away that Beast affair!
   1182414|00000000||Work's hard on the nerves, eh? It's why you're so gray.
   1182416|00000000||A job is like a lady. You can always get a new one.
   1182422|00000000||Hey, mate!
   1182426|00000000||What's new, handsome knight?
   1182424|00000000||How's it!
   1199070|00000000||Sir! Help, please! I'm hauling stone for the statue, but -- monsters!!
   1199072|00000000||Witcher! Save us! And the wagon!
   1199076|00000000||We'll be up and rolling again in no time! They're waiting on us!
   1199074|00000000||Thank you, sir witcher! Lebioda keep you in his care!
   1209308|00000000||Geralt overheard a conversation between two knights. One of them had recently undergone a mysterious trial. This had played out on the shores of Lac Célavy.<br>
   1209309|00000000||On the lakeshore Geralt encountered a hermit who promised the witcher a wondrous blade. To receive it, Geralt had to prove he lived by the five chivalric virtues.<br>
   1209310|00000000||Geralt proved that he live by the Five Chivalric Virtues. <br>
   1209311|00000000||In a duel that played out upon the lake's surface, Geralt defeated the mysterious hermit. To his great surprise, the hermit then proved to be no man, revealing himself to have been the Lady of the Lake in disguise. Geralt had met the Lady some time past along his Path. The Lady of the Lake bestowed upon him the legendary blade called Aerondight. <br>
   1209312|00000000||The witcher met a hermit threw down the gauntlet, brazenly challenging Geralt to a duel.<br>
   1209313|00000000||After a fierce and beautiful fight, Geralt defeated the hermit. The witcher was then greatly surprised to learn the man was in fact the Lady of the Lake in disguise, a woman Geralt had encountered long past on his Path. As the hermit had promised, the Lady bestowed upon Geralt the legendary sword called Aerondight. <br>
   1209314|00000000||Unfortunately, Geralt failed to prove he was in possession of the Five Chivalric Virtues.<br>
   1209315|00000000||Though Geralt reached the isle upon Lac Célavy, he found no one there. Most likely he had waited too long to investigate the matter, and after all, we well know Destiny does not like to wait…<br>
   1209961|00000000||Upon a notice board in Toussaint, Geralt spotted a mysterious notice inviting all who dared to undergo a Test of Virtue. All who wished to face the challenge, clearly to their character above all, were to find their way to an Isle upon Lac Célavy. Our witcher found the notice intriguing enough that he resolved to see what the test entailed.<br>
   1209966|00000000||The trial of valor hardly proved easy, but Geralt emerged from it victorious, defeating quite an extraordinary foe. He thus proved he was no stranger to the chivalric virtues.
   1209967|00000000||The witchers' codex does not require its adherents to demonstrate honor, but Geralt was an honorable man in and of himself. As a result, he completed the trial for this virtue with flying colors.<br>
   1209968|00000000||Not a soul expects witchers to show compassion for the simple reason that their profession offers few opportunities where they even might demonstrate mercy, let alone should. Geralt nonetheless managed to demonstrate that he could show compassion when warranted, and thus also was in possession of this virtue.<br>
   1209969|00000000||Generosity is a hard virtue to demonstrate for the simple reason that it generally requires to demonstrator to bear a cost. Many show themselves capable of being valiant or honorable when it benefits them, yet when circumstances call on them to dig deep into their coin pouches, the purse strings turn out to be knotted tight. Luckily, Geralt was not of this ilk and proved himself a generous man, thanks to which he also successfully completed the trial for this virtue.<br>
   1209970|00000000||Among the virtues, wisdom oft proves hardest to find, let alone prove, for most consider themselves wise while the world is chock full of fools. Yet Geralt had never thought of himself too highly in this regard, just like that famed philosopher who knew well that he knew very little if not nothing. Perhaps this was why the witcher managed easily to prove he was no stranger to this virtue.<br>

   1189142|00000000||Toussaint, Toussaint, where folk are gay and merry.
   1195113|00000000||In Toussaint, in Toussaint, life is a ripe strawberry.
   1195115|00000000||And Beauclair, Beauclair is a lovely dream.
   1195117|00000000||A dream that adorns all as if in rich whipped cream.
   1195127|00000000||Come ladies, come knights, come maids, come lords…
   1195129|00000000||Come adventure lovers, come spryly, in hordes!
   1195131|00000000||For here in Toussaint we boast exquisite wine…
   1195133|00000000||And that's rather enough to have a very good time.
   1188008|00000000||Never thought Syanna would be so unrelenting.
   1188051|00000000||No one suspected Syanna'd be merciless. Not Damien, not me… least of all the duchess.
   1188019|00000000||Anna Henrietta was too trusting.
   1188053|00000000||Anna Henrietta wanted to believe there was still hope for Syanna, that she'd show remorse… She reached a hand out to her. Too soon. Too trusting.
   1188063|00000000||Ahh… I know you. You're that witcher from the North. The one that saved us from the Beast.
   1188065|00000000||Mhm. Could say that.
   1188067|00000000||Wait here. Take these.
   1188069|00000000||Thought you were out of flowers…
   1188071|00000000||I put a bouquet aside. I was to take it to her myself. But you have it. I know you held the duchess dear…
   1188073|00000000||How much do I owe you?
   1188075|00000000||Not a copper. Keep your coin and raise a toast in her memory tonight.
   1188085|00000000||Do just that. Farewell.
   1188049|00000000||How? Quickly. Unexpectedly. She was gone before I understood what was happening.
   1188007|00000000||I let the duchess down.
   1187665|00000000||Need some flowers, a wreath, or--
   1187667|00000000||I've none. Sold everything. I was just on my way out. No sense hanging about with nothing to do.
   1187678|00000000||Should come as no shock, sir. Had the funeral, folk took it all. Men, women, children - all wished to lay a bouquet on the duchess' grave. Windflowers, peonies, gladioli…
   1187680|00000000||But she liked common roses best. I know, her ladies-in-waiting would come here at times. I'd choose the loveliest blooms for her - fragrant, big petals, the kind that last a long time.
   1188006|00000000||Ahh… I've still not come to terms with it. To be killed by her own sister… How could it happen?
   1154550|00000000||During her final confrontation with the Beast of Beauclair, Sylvia Anna, sister to Her Highness Anna Henrietta, had died tragically. The duchess was understandably distraught, for she had just recently been reunited with her long lost sibling. She was also understandably irate with Geralt and had the witcher thrown into the dungeon. There, in a somber mood, he awaited his sentence, expecting the worst.<br>Though at base she is known to have a heart of gold, Anarietta is also known to be highly impetuous. The smallest misdeed can at times bring a severe penalty, especially if she deems the transgression a personal offence. Believe me, I know.<br>
   1167218|00000000||Who knows what might have happened to the witcher had not our mutual friend Regis demonstrated such clarity of mind. He did the sole reasonable thing under the circumstances and sent for yours truly.<br>Immediately, and without hesitating for even a moment to think that my life, too, could be in danger, I mounted my steed and rode post haste to Toussaint. Luckily, I managed to convince Anarietta - that is to say, Her Illustrious Highness - to spare Geralt's life and restore his freedom.<br>The witcher, saved through my efforts, was reunited with Regis. The vampire awaited him at the prison gate only to draw him into another misadventure. For Regis had been unable to rid himself of a thought. Namely, he believed Syanna had planned five murders from the start. He was tormented and wished to know the identity of the fifth intended victim. He suggested to Geralt that they investigate the matter to its end.<br>
   1205981|00000000||They first sought out the bootblack. The boy directed them to a poorhouse. It was there they learned Syanna had indeed planned five murders. All to wreak vengeance upon those who had caused her to be banished from the court and the Ducal Palace. The final victim was to have been her very own sister, Duchess Anna Henrietta.<br>
   1206019|00000000||Few know the human soul and its complexities as poets do. Thus, I do not wonder why the witcher chose to inform Duchess Anna Henrietta of his findings. Driven by his sense of duty, he told her that Syanna, the sister miraculously and recently restored to her, then suddenly and irretrievably lost, had planned to have her murdered. Geralt was simply seeking to bring matters to a close. He does not, alas, possess that sixth sense that would allow him to foresee the duchess' reaction. Luckily, I was there (again) to quell the emotional outburst that might have meant the witcher's end.<br>
   1154551|00000000||Geralt and Regis made their way to the vampire's crypt at the charming Mère-Lachaiselongue Cemetery. There, they indulged in some well-deserved respite while sipping Regis' exquisite (as they both assured me) mandrake hooch.<br>

   1201764|00000000||No knowing how long she'll live.
   1201779|00000000||Method she chose worked. Thing is, she might only live for a few years more. Seven or so, most likely. Though I could be wrong.
   1201781|00000000||You had better be! You failed me, witcher. I placed my trust in you, and--
   1201783|00000000||It was Vivienne's decision. Wanted to do it her way. Can't blame me for that.
   1205453|00000000||Got this bard friend, philosopher, too, I guess, amateur. He'd say, if you love somebody, set them free.
   1201977|00000000||Do you know what, Geralt? You earned your reward, so take it. But keep your advice to yourself. Adieu.
   1201769|00000000||Vivienne chose what suited her best. She's completely free now. And happy… I think.
   1201774|00000000||Without me…
   1201776|00000000||You helped her. But that doesn't mean she owes you her love.
   1201763|00000000||Vivienne's happy.
   1201768|00000000||She asked me to pass on a message.
   1201772|00000000||Asked me to give you a message - said she's grateful. Thanks to you, she can live a normal life.
   1201787|00000000||Good, good… but how does she fare?
   1181769|00000000||Geralt! What of Vivienne?
   1181771|00000000||Managed to lift her curse.
   1181773|00000000||Truly? So all will be well, her troubles are done?
   1201903|00000000||What's brought you to Novigrad?
   1201905|00000000||I've toured the entire city, already. Now I seek a ship to take me to the Skellige Isles.
   1201907|00000000||I've heard there are beautiful flying sirens there. And mountains that rise out of the sea into the sky. Is any of it true?
   1201909|00000000||It all is, actually. Except you'll want to watch out for the sirens. As beautiful as they are dangerous.
   1201911|00000000||I shall be careful, I promise. Farewell, Geralt. Ah! One last thing. I would like you to have this. I kept it at first… as a memento. But I think I'd prefer not to have anything to remind me of that time. Will you take it?
   1211147|00000000||Course. Thank you. And take care.
   1201874|00000000||In Novigrad? What're you doing here?
   1201875|00000000||How are you?
   1201891|00000000||How do you feel? No relapse?
   1201893|00000000||None. I feel wonderful. You've no idea how relieved I am. I went to see a mummers play in Pont Vanis. Out of doors, and it went on late into the night.
   1201895|00000000||And I did not need to flee at dusk. I also attended Baroness de Cordelle's ball, danced till the break of dawn!
   1201877|00000000||Vivienne. Hey.
   1201879|00000000||Witcher! So good to see you.
   1189805|00000000||Guillaume. What--? What're you doing here?
   1181791|00000000||Leave me be… Without my Vivienne, life has no meaning. You are the last to whom I wish to speak.

   1161955|00000000||What're you arguing about?
   1111148|00000000||What's this argument about, anyway?
   1168219|00000000||Sod off! Not your concern!
   1168221|00000000||Could help you resolve it.
   1162024|00000000||Whose crypt is this? Rightfully?
   1162026|00000000||Who does the crypt belong to? Rightfully.
   1162051|00000000||Must you ask? It's mine, my family's, the de Corentins'. Are you illiterate?
   1179788|00000000||True, but my dowry served to repurchase it from those you owed.
   1162055|00000000||Look, if there's to be peace and quiet here, one of you's gotta go. Need to move one of you out.
   1162087|00000000||Yes, take him! Please! Do so, and I shall… I shall tell you where I hid his lucky gwent cards.
   1162127|00000000||What?! I knew it was you! And now you would evict me from my crypt, then pay for the deed with my cards?!
   1162129|00000000||Blast it all! Had I those very cards at the tournament in Belhaven, I'd still be alive! It's your fault, you pox incarnate, that they stabbed me to death!
   1168233|00000000||They murdered you for your debts, I had nothing to do with it!
   1162137|00000000||Come, why heed this Good Book-thumping wench? Mind, I know well where she hid those cards. I'll tell you myself - as soon as you've removed her.
   1162131|00000000||Hm. Need to think about it.
   1162023|00000000||Gotta get one of you outta here.
   1161993|00000000||I know not your name, but you must help me! I refuse to spend eternity at the side of this heathen! Remove him from my crypt at once!
   1161995|00000000||Slow down. What's the problem?
   1161997|00000000||This is my crypt! And this saintly shrew harangues me, even in death! An eternity of nagging - the misery!
   1161999|00000000||I was blind and a fool to marry him! He's a slave to the cards, prepared to wager his own child on a round of gwent!
   1162001|00000000||Once, dammit! And as a jest! How many times must I explain?! And who sank our fortune into some silly statue of Lebioda?!
   1162020|00000000||Piety! That was my cause! The prophet immortalized would have transformed this land of blasphemy and betting! How was I to know it was all a fraud?!
   1162022|00000000||Because I warned you?! Some five hundred times?!
   1168223|00000000||Quiet! Shut up! Both of you!
   1111116|00000000||Mind keeping it down? Neighbors're complaining.
   1111119|00000000||Neighbors? Everyone here is dead.
   1161956|00000000||Mind keeping it down?
   1161933|00000000||You'd rather lie about all day, flipping those cards like some… some dwarf! Disgusting! Ptooey!
   1161935|00000000||Indeed! Far better to stand at the door of Lebioda's temple, mumbling prayers from dawn till dusk!
   1161937|00000000||Ingrate! I prayed for you! That you would cast off the yoke of gambling!
   1161954|00000000||Fine job you did of it! Seems the gods had also heard enough of your cackling! And you! Why are you here? This is a private conversation!
   1209363|00000000||No, no! It is I who shall speak to you no more, you old tart!
   1209361|00000000||Heretic! Shut your mouth! I shall speak to you no more!
   1151667|00000000||After which he promptly added, "For you shall have none left for me!"
   1095353|00000000||"Thus spake the prophet Lebioda: Thou shalt not play for coin."
   1209351|00000000||I shall speak to no one as long as she is in here. Take her away.
   1209353|00000000||My apologies, but I'm simply not in the mood.
   1181142|00000000||Keep your eyes peeled for the hanses, witcher.

   1193916|00000000||Good day.
   1193918|00000000||Not good.
   1193920|00000000||What's going on here?
   1190679|00000000||Hmm, strange… Something behind this wall, I think.
   1190683|00000000||A laboratory. Must've been an alchemist's at one time.
   1208690|00000000||<i>”Look! Pixies!”<br>”We should go. Now.”<br>”Come on, what harm can cute little pixies do us?”</i><br> – last words of two criminals who broke into the Land of a Thousand Fables, identities unknown<br><br>Pixies might look like gentle, harmless creatures, yet in their case, the saying about appearances being deceiving fits all too perfectly.

Thus whenever anyone else crossed the pixies’ path, it ended badly for them, for pixies are aggressive, war-like creatures, created to kill, defend and fight till they can fight no more.

   1207837|00000000||Listen, about the specter…
   1146951|00000000||Back at last. I thought you'd not return.
   1117311|00000000||If I start muttering something about unicorns or sorceresses… ignore it.
   1117309|00000000||All right. High time we tried this.
   1117313|00000000||Ready the brew. My turn to drink it.
   1125611|00000000||Need to tend to something else, first. We'll do this another time.
   1117314|00000000||I'll be back.
   1142064|00000000||Hm. A proper brew could be our only chance to figure this out.
   1142061|00000000||Could actually work.
   1142062|00000000||Mushrooms can produce bad side effects.
   1142068|00000000||This mushroom, even in me, could produce some nasty, unpredictable side effects.
   1146937|00000000||True, there is no knowing how graytop would effect a mutated body.
   1117301|00000000||Most likely some kind of wraith's tormenting you. Can't tell what kind, though. Felt weak, spent, lately? Noticed bite marks on your skin?
   1172047|00000000||As I said, I feel weaker by the day. And bites? Of course, there are lice and midges here aplenty…
   1172049|00000000||This isn't lice. Something much bigger drinks your blood while you sleep.
   1117303|00000000||But I do not sleep, not a wink. He's always present, always watching - I cannot bear it any longer.
   1117305|00000000||Sadly, not much I can do. Can't exterminate it if I can't see it.
   1117307|00000000||The graytop, I shall make a brew of it for you. I've two mushrooms left, enough for one dose. Perhaps then you'll see what I do?
   1156977|00000000||Some kind of wraith's tormenting you.

   1194728|00000000||Got an itch needs scratchin'…?
   1194730|00000000||So, what's it gonna be?
   1188687|00000000||Boor!
   1188693|00000000||We shall long bear the scars of that witcher's… visit.
   1188691|00000000||Truly, to send a witcher against the Beast…? It's as if one sought to treat the clap with crabs.
   1188695|00000000||The duquessa's death shall weigh on your conscience, butcher!
   1188689|00000000||Well, scallywag? Pleased with the mess you've made?
   1188701|00000000||Do not touch.
   1188697|00000000||Greetings.

   1193610|00000000||Oh, my. Greetings.
   1193612|00000000||Your reputation precedes you, Geralt.
   1162633|00000000||Felicitations, witcher. It seems you've won.
   1151188|00000000||Bloody hell! Let him out!
   1173295|00000000||He gobbled up my gingerbread. Now it's my turn to gobble him. Heeheehee!
   1173297|00000000||Ugh!
   1173335|00000000||Hands off of my hearth, dearie. You wouldn't want me to get cross.
   1151197|00000000||Then you open it!
   1173324|00000000||Now who is this? A lost traveler? You're not supposed to be here, sweetie.
   1173333|00000000||Why, you're old. Old and pale. But never worry - a bit of butter, a bit of spice, and you'll make a tasty morsel.
   1211285|00000000||Just as soon as I catch you.
   1176785|00000000||Be careful!
   1210134|00000000||Come, now! You cannot possibly fear a few magical plants!
   1165040|00000000||Hm. Voices?
   1210136|00000000||Ugh… That soup smells more vile than a rotting carcass! Careful she doesn't douse you!
   1210138|00000000||Hah! A clash of sword and broomstick! I've not seen this before!
   1162631|00000000||Seems you're having a tough go of it, witcher.
   1137575|00000000||My heart swells to behold this beautiful celebration of valor and honor. And to witness you, who embody the chivalric virtues in your lives, strive for greatness.
   1160273|00000000||Yet after a time of combat must come a time of peace and respite.
   1160658|00000000||Thus, I invite all who fought in the tourney to this feast held in your, and none others', honor. And should any among you crave solitude, private tents await you nearby.
   1160275|00000000||The group melee shall take place on the morrow. Glory shall be within grasp for each and every one of you.
   1160277|00000000||The best among you shall have the honor to face our reigning champion.
   1160616|00000000||The famed Gregoire de Gorgon, victor of last year's tourney.
   1160618|00000000||Celebrate, make merry, revel as you will, yet be mindful of the trial that awaits you tomorrow.
   1160660|00000000||Follow her. We shall meet in your tent before your last contest. You must help her!
   1102067|00000000||Any semblance of false modesty aside, I can comfortably contend that my songs of Geralt's deeds are known the world over. The Duchy of Toussaint is no exception. There, my ballads praising our witcher's so oft demonstrated valor and honor remain popular to the extreme. So much so, that on one occasion it was chiefly thanks to my works that Geralt was offered a contract. A young noble lady, who had learned of the witcher solely from my thoroughly accurate descriptions, picked him out of a crowd and promptly begged him for aid. She was concerned for her fiancé, François, who had set out not long past to slay a monster in honor of his betrothed. The monster was known as Grottore, and the lady's beloved had not yet returned. The lady tasked the witcher with learning what had become of the young knight…<br>
   1151652|00000000||Few know just how nosy Geralt actually is. He rarely takes the path more frequently traveled, choosing instead to scale mountains, forge through dense brush and traverse many a wilderness. During one such foray through the largely unknown, he happened on a cave at the entrance of which lay numerous corpses. Before the witcher could begin to penetrate it, however, he was stopped by a young knight named François, who had vowed before his betrothed that he would kill the monster that dwelled within the cave.<br>
   1165286|00000000||Alas, young François stood no chance against Grottore. He perished, pounded to a pulp by the terrible beast.<br>
   1165287|00000000||With Geralt's aid, the young François managed to defeat the fierce Grottore and thus fulfill the vow he had made. Yet he showed an immense desire to postpone another vow - that customarily made in a chapel with one's previously betrothed at one's side. But the witcher reasoned with the knight, and François returned to his heart's captor to begin preparing for the day they would wed.<br>
   1165288|00000000||With Geralt's aid the young François managed to defeat the fierce Grottore and thus fulfilled the vow he had made. Yet he proved unwilling to make another vow, the kind one customarily makes in a chapel with one's beloved at one's side. Instead of returning to his heart's captor he decided instead to set out in search of another monster he could face and conquer…<br>
   1165289|00000000||Geralt could do nothing to bring François back from the dead, but he could avenge the young knight and at once rid the land of a dangerous beast. Thus he drew his silver sword, sent it into a whirl, and soon after Grottore's ample dome dangled from the trophy hook affixed to the witcher's saddle.<br>
   1165290|00000000||Geralt once told me, albeit in confidence, that the witchers' codex he sometimes cited did not in fact exist. That he nurtured and occasionally employed said concept as an excuse of convenience to avoid taking on inappropriate contracts. I sometimes regret that his guild failed to formulate such by-laws - if it had perhaps Geralt would have aided young François or at the least avenged the unfortunate knight.<br>
   1102065|00000000||Help François defeat Grottore.
   1105083|00000000||Find François.
   1105084|00000000||Follow François.

   1193489|00000000||Waa waaa waaa!
   1188633|00000000||I won't go! I simply won't do it!
   1188631|00000000||I've three doublets, none of which are suitable to show myself in!
   1188635|00000000||I shall go. Or perhaps I won't…

   1211427|00000000||Geralt had first encountered the Lady of the Lake when his search for what had been stolen from Kaer Morhen took him to the village known as Murky Waters. There a mysterious female being dwelled in the murky depths of the village’s namesake waters and watched over the residents living on the shores. Such was their esteem for their underwater guardian, they erected a monument in her honor. The Lady of the Lake once had many knights in her service, but they had all died, as valiant knights tend to, during campaigns in far-off lands. She now lived in near solitude, so was glad to accept Geralt’s company, the witcher being someone she liked and respected.<br><br>Once the witcher had believed the Lady of the Lake was some kind of local goddess, but their reunion at Lac Célavy made him realize she did not dwell only in Murky Waters. Instead, the Lady of the Lake calls home any place where virtue and chivalry are honored.

   1162747|00000000||Help a poor beggar!
   1162745|00000000||Give us a copper!
   1192846|00000000||The duquessa's dead! What will become of us?!
   1162749|00000000||Come, now , sir toss us a coin!
   1162751|00000000||A copper, that is all I ask!
   1170954|00000000||Ah, so it was mommy who helped you…
   1202655|00000000||Was in a bad way, barely crawling.
   1202657|00000000||Flew off together. Probably bound for their nest.
   1202641|00000000||Hm, second draconid landed here. A larger one. Waited for the smaller one to heal, then they flew off together.
   1202643|00000000||Should be easy to track - smaller one was still bleeding, luckily.
   1202684|00000000||Hm, another cow… This one's been dead a lot longer, though. Slyzard did this, too. Can tell by the claw marks, the burns.
   1202686|00000000||Must feel safe here.
   1209393|00000000||Huh, another cow. Been here longer, this one. Lots. What do we got here - burn marks? Hmm… No wyvern made these.
   1209400|00000000||Slyzards, gotta be. Only they breathe fire. Clearly feel safe here. Mh.
   1170956|00000000||Whoa, slyzard's son seems to be joining the fray.
   1126968|00000000||Could free his spirit, pardoning him on behalf of his horse.
   1127056|00000000||But you shouldn't do it if you don't think he deserves forgiveness.
   1191824|00000000||Did a rotten thing. Got no excuse. Your horse was loyal, did the best damn job he could, 'cause that's how we horses are.
   1191834|00000000||True… I know I deserved what befell me.
   1191826|00000000||But we aren't vengeful, don't hold grudges, don't dwell on being left in monster-infested woods… So in your poor Blaze's name, I forgive you.
   1191854|00000000||Oh, thank you! I feel… it's incredible! Such relief, such lightness…
   1126952|00000000||Forgive him if you can.
   1143269|00000000||You don't deserve mercy.
   1126985|00000000||Anyone who flogs a horse to death on account of some silly tourney deserves a fate this bad.
   1127137|00000000||Let's kick his astral ass, Geralt! For Blaze!
   1127096|00000000||Poor hermit. Won't let you torment her again.
   1126953|00000000||Doesn't deserve mercy, this one.
   1143271|00000000||Can't forgive you for that - not in my power.
   1143273|00000000||But your horse could. Please, I'd do anything, I'm desperate… Help me.
   1143275|00000000||Noble mare! Forgive me my sin!
   1143268|00000000||Not the one you should ask for forgiveness.
   1143259|00000000||Must've hurt her something awful if she refuses to forgive you, would rather see you suffer. What'd you do?
   1143261|00000000||To her? Nothing. But my horse, I… I flogged it to death. Pinastri, she saw this.
   1143263|00000000||A proud stallion, my Blaze. But he was a bucker, and tossed me during a tourney. One I'd wanted to win badly!
   1187495|00000000||Pinastri had been so glad they'd let me stand - me, a peasant's son. I wanted to win it for her. But that horse made me lose. Rage overcame me… I struck and struck, until at last he fell.
   1143265|00000000||Oh, the regret! I beg you, forgive me. Absolve me in Blaze's very name.
   1143247|00000000||Begging for forgiveness. What'd you do?
   1126942|00000000||You and the hermit, how do you know each other?
   1126944|00000000||We met as babes, grew up side by side. I… I loved her… yet she was always sad, nothing could cheer her. The world terrified her. I thought her gloom came from being poor, so I did my damndest to take us from our village, make us a better life elsewhere.
   1127128|00000000||Became a squire, took her with me to the palace. But Pinastri soon learned nobles are no more decent than peasants, not a speck.
   1127131|00000000||Once even I'd grown vile to her eyes, she fled the palace and joined the flagellants.
   1191968|00000000||I left the court to be near her. Yet she cast me off, said she didn't want to know me.
   1127139|00000000||When the whip-bearers proved too hard-hearted for her, too, she became a hermit. I see it clearly now… though I never understood her while alive.
   1191857|00000000||From the grave's dark depth, the living are bright, sharp flares. You see all their thoughts at once. Now I understand why she had to cast me off…
   1191970|00000000||Hm, she's full of rage. Probably what turned you into an umbra.
   1191790|00000000||You and the hermit, what's the link?
   1143248|00000000||What's with the horse? Why appear to her as that?
   1143267|00000000||Why take the form of a horse?
   1143277|00000000||A horse? What do you mean? Each day since I died, a power lifts me from my grave and makes me run…
   1191804|00000000||Then I return with blood in my mouth.
   1191806|00000000||I don't know what this is… how it comes to pass. But I do know the torment will continue until she forgives me.
   1191808|00000000||But she sees me as a horse, you say?
   1191810|00000000||Seems so. Same way I saw you.
   1122541|00000000||Marcello Clerici. Knight. Died last year. Was more or less the same age as our hermit.
   1143282|00000000||Seems his spirit's become a horse-shaped umbra that's tormenting Pinastri.
   1122543|00000000||Why're you telling me this? I can read. And draw my own conclusions.
   1122545|00000000||Thinking aloud, that's all. Helps me focus.
   1126904|00000000||Geralt! It's the umbra! Attack!
   1122547|00000000||Let me explain!
   1191787|00000000||Talk. But make it fast. Why're you tormenting the hermit?
   1191789|00000000||She torments me! Refuses to forgive me. I'm denied peace in the afterlife, and it's all her doing. Each day I come and beg her for clemency!
   1191850|00000000||Beg her for clemency? You drink her blood, drive her mad with fear.
   1191852|00000000||I don't know how to explain it, but yes, a monstrous force takes me. Though I also know I'll not have peace till the day Pinastri forgives me.

   1161369|00000000||Clear the way, I said!
   1185145|00000000||You got lost!
   1185147|00000000||Sorry.
   1161371|00000000||It's here, just round the corner!
   1161373|00000000||Hurry!
   1197194|00000000||Now across the bridge!
   1205392|00000000||Your Grace seems right at home in the saddle!
   1161351|00000000||Faster, Geralt! Ride like the wind!
   1197175|00000000||Sharp right! Take care!

   1194642|00000000||Eeek!
   1194644|00000000||Oh!
   1194647|00000000||Greetings.
   1191913|00000000||Eh?
   1191915|00000000||Mrmrmrmr… blech!
   1191917|00000000||Win, win, wind, wind's a-blowin'…
   1191919|00000000||Bllluurrgh. Bugger off, 'fore I puke on ye.
   1191921|00000000||Help… Good folk…
   1195390|00000000||What, dammit?
   1195392|00000000||What are you lookin' at?
   1195394|00000000||Ptooey!
   1195398|00000000||Ugh?
   1195400|00000000||Kick him!

   1171703|00000000||Wine by the barrel, wine by the crate - wine is my lover, my master, my mate!
   1193340|00000000||Come, give us a hug, witcher! You Beast slayer, you!
   1171707|00000000||Let us drink to the health of our ladies - for healthy ladies spread no clap!
   1171709|00000000||No such thing as an unsightly lady. An impression of that sort means but a shortage of wine.
   1185097|00000000||You saved our lives. You've our thanks.
   1170987|00000000||Back, you beast! Begone!
   1170985|00000000||Help! Save us!
   1185099|00000000||Thank you, thank you so very much!
   1185101|00000000||And then, slash! Slash! Hah!
   1170993|00000000||If… if not for you, we'd have been done for.
   1170995|00000000||Thank you. You saved our lives.

   1144381|00000000||Thoroughly wise!
   1144385|00000000||Yes?
   1144383|00000000||Is it not evident I'm busy?
   1186796|00000000||Phew, phew, phew…
   1194070|00000000||Hello.
   1194072|00000000||Take care.
   1194076|00000000||Something's in the wind.
   1172860|00000000||The Toussaintois' most common ailments? Hangovers and stab wounds.
   1172858|00000000||We piece together what the knights slice up…
   1172862|00000000||How are we feeling?
   1172864|00000000||Greetings.
   1175174|00000000||Greetings!
   1175172|00000000||How might I be of service?
   1175178|00000000||Truthfully? Only a witcher stands to best the Beast!
   1193321|00000000||Oh! The man who saved us all! Our salvadore. Geralt of Rivia!
   1175176|00000000||To be honest? Every last man-Jacques in these parts has but wine and women on the brain!
   1156674|00000000||Cave I came out of - what was that place?
   1156732|00000000||Cave I came out of… what was that place?
   1156737|00000000||There lies the gate between this world… and ours. It is closed.
   1176396|00000000||But it shall open once more. In one hundred of your years. Two hundred. Three.
   1176398|00000000||Soon.
   1156740|00000000||Now speak. Don't ask. Or I will kill you.
   1156750|00000000||Questions. More questions!
   1184595|00000000||Hey… Anyone here…? Just wanna talk!
   1156752|00000000||You waste my time.
   1156755|00000000||No. No, wait…
   1156857|00000000||Innocents are dying.
   1156859|00000000||Humans, elves, dwarves… die each day. By the hundreds.
   1156884|00000000||As do cattle. Swine. Rats.
   1156886|00000000||You see no difference? Refuse to believe it.
   1157202|00000000||Swine do not disturb me.
   1156780|00000000||Innocents are dying.
   1179969|00000000||You'll kill them, of course. So they'll flood these caves… or bring in sappers from Mahakam and collapse them.
   1156923|00000000||To convince Dettlaff to spare the city.
   1152139|00000000||Dettlaff - we have to convince him to spare the city.
   1156956|00000000||Will he?
   1156958|00000000||Probably not. Yet… we must try nonetheless.
   1156960|00000000||If there is a fight, if you help kill him...
   1156962|00000000||I will be anathema. This I know. And still I ask you to summon Dettlaff.
   1152149|00000000||Need a moment to cool down after that… that meeting. Meet you there.
   1152146|00000000||Meet you there. Need to tend to something first.
   1152147|00000000||Yes, straight there. Let's go.
   1152153|00000000||Let's go. Want to get this over with.
   1157146|00000000||Time to summon Dettlaff.
   1157177|00000000||Ah. Yes… high time. Do… do you wish to go to Tesham Mutna right away?
   1157021|00000000||Dettlaff - time to face him.
   1176489|00000000||And you? How do you feel now, where you are?
   1176494|00000000||Geralt, imagine the least comfortable situation you could ever find yourself in. What would it be? I don't mean a moment of pain, with death knocking at your door, just a circumstance of great unease.
   1176500|00000000||All right, in that case a court banquet. Gotta show up in hose and a tight doublet. Gotta smile at everyone and engage in vacuous conversation. While Dandelion sings a ballad about me and Yennefer for all to hear.
   1176506|00000000||Very well. Now imagine you're stuck there - not for an hour, not for an evening, but for all time.
   1176508|00000000||And should you fall out of character for but a moment, should you so much as scratch yourself where the stitching chafes, all around you will scream, "Monster! Monster!" And they'll turn on you and tear you to shreds.
   1176510|00000000||Sounds… tiring. Damn tiring.
   1176512|00000000||I couldn't have put it better myself.
   1176469|00000000||What're your feelings?
   1176470|00000000||Think you'll all ever be able to go home?
   1176472|00000000||Cave I was tossed into… that where the gate between worlds is?
   1176474|00000000||In a sense, yes. Just slammed shut, sealed tight.
   1176476|00000000||Think it'll ever open again? Think you'll be able to go home?
   1176478|00000000||Ah. I sincerely doubt it. And I think in truth the Elder knows that as well.
   1176480|00000000||So why would he stay down there? What's the real reason?
   1176485|00000000||Hm. To stay with the "gate" analogy - no door is ever completely impermeable. Smells come through, for instance. And when the wind rises, some dust might be blown through the cracks. A palpable trace of things on the other side.
   1176487|00000000||It's not much… but it is something.
   1157124|00000000||All your Unseen that… hm… welcoming?
   1157126|00000000||No. They vary. Some are conceited, others imperious, but… most can be reasoned with.
   1157129|00000000||But him… It was clear each word was a great effort. Interacting with others, it seems it causes him physical pain.
   1157132|00000000||Never entered my mind - that the Conjunction of the Spheres was also a cataclysm for you, for…
   1157134|00000000||Monsters. No euphemism required, you needn't seek one.
   1157136|00000000||I dare say it was worse for us. You arrived by the thousands, we were but a handful. Not much choice - assimilate with you… or shut ourselves off from the world. Like him.
   1157122|00000000||All Unseen Elders like that?
   1157022|00000000||Better? You kidding?
   1157024|00000000||Think that went better than…? You kidding? I'd 'ave been dead on the spot if not for my slowed metabolism.
   1157026|00000000||And yet you survived.
   1157033|00000000||Though you are risking your life. The question is why. This contract… it goes well beyond what witchers customarily handle. I cannot abandon the matter, for Dettlaff and I are bound by blood, but you… you could simply walk away.
   1157036|00000000||So why, my friend? Why stay and risk your hide?
   1157067|00000000||Same reason as ever. For the reward.
   1157069|00000000||You believe it will be worth all this?
   1157071|00000000||Better be.
   1157038|00000000||For the reward.
   1193987|00000000||For you. You're in a heap of trouble, Regis, trouble Dettlaff brought on. Seen you die once already. That one time was enough.
   1193989|00000000||I… Hm. I'm not certain I know what to say.
   1193992|00000000||I am grateful, Geralt.
   1193985|00000000||For you.
   1157037|00000000||Dunno.
   1157061|00000000||Been on the Path so long I… I don't really know anymore. Guess I'm looking for the road's end.
   1157063|00000000||Perhaps you should simply step off it?
   1157065|00000000||I'll think about it. Once this is over.
   1157020|00000000||Oooph… That went better than I expected it would.
   1152141|00000000||Where?
   1179988|00000000||Tesham Mutna.
   1179990|00000000||Go. Once I sense you there, I will summon Dettlaff.
   1157013|00000000||I thank you.
   1157015|00000000||Leave me.
   1152125|00000000||Dettlaff must die.
   1152127|00000000||I will not kill one of my own.
   1152129|00000000||We ask only that you summon him. We… we shall see to the rest.
   1152131|00000000||If you drink from him...
   1152133|00000000||I will be anathema. This I know. And still I ask you to summon Dettlaff.
   1156922|00000000||Dettlaff has to die.
   1176418|00000000||No… This place must be secure. The gate…
   1176420|00000000||Uuuugh… Echhh…
   1176422|00000000||What is your plan?
   1179971|00000000||You'll kill them, naturally. So they'll flood these caves… or collapse 'em with explosives. Destroying the gate you guard beyond repair.
   1193957|00000000||As Khagmar brought trouble before.
   1156892|00000000||Folk'll take him down, eventually. Might need a year, or two, or a decade. But they'll find a way.
   1156894|00000000||And then they'll go after other vampires. And eventually, they'll find you.
   1156896|00000000||And I should fear…?
   1156898|00000000||Death? No. But that'll be the end of your peace, your quiet. Knights errant, mages - they'll come here day in, day out. One already managed to teleport here. Others will follow - you can be sure.
   1193953|00000000||Sooner or later, Dettlaff'll bring trouble, serious trouble.
   1193955|00000000||How?
   1156781|00000000||Dettlaff spells trouble for you.
   1156810|00000000||Help me, and I'll return the favor.
   1156846|00000000||Help me, and I'll return the favor.
   1156849|00000000||Hehehehehe…
   1156851|00000000||You? Help me? How?
   1156853|00000000||Depends on you. I'm not just some human, I'm--
   1156855|00000000||You are no one.
   1176412|00000000||I ask for the last time. Why should I care about Dettlaff? Why should I help you?
   1156759|00000000||Here about Dettlaff. He's--
   1156761|00000000||I know who he is.
   1156763|00000000||What of him?
   1156765|00000000||He's sicced a swarm of lesser vampires on the city. I have to stop him.
   1156767|00000000||But I do not.
   1156673|00000000||Here about Dettlaff.
   1156675|00000000||What did you do to Regis?
   1156735|00000000||What… what's with Regis?
   1156742|00000000||Nothing. He sleeps.
   1156744|00000000||Will you wake him?
   1156746|00000000||Perhaps. Perhaps not.
   1156748|00000000||You were to speak. Not question. Speak! Or die!
   1152107|00000000||You live…
   1156286|00000000||Barely.
   1156289|00000000||You're not attacking. That mean you'll hear me out?
   1156291|00000000||Perhaps.
   1156672|00000000||Speak.
   1184591|00000000||Eclthi, lautni ama.
   1190063|00000000||I've seen a great many things in my life, but cattle dropping from the sky? That's a first.
   1196500|00000000||Who knows, maybe a whole bovine downpour's next.
   1196502|00000000||Bovine downpour - foolish notion. What would the clouds have to be like to carry that much cattle?
   1196504|00000000||Huh, I didn't think about that.
   1087880|c385e52b||Ponce
    472898|00306a9c||Girl
   1187889|00000000||Think we could do some renovating?
   1187011|00000000||Mentioned the place could stand to be spruced up…
   1187013|00000000||Oh, most decidedly, sir! The question is where you would like to begin this rejuvenation.
   1188010|00000000||Got these spacious grounds… Hmmm, but maybe it's time to make them more, umm… useful.
   1190008|00000000||Oh, yes, we certainly should!
   1195155|00000000||But of course, and have you anything specific in mind, sir?
   1188012|00000000||Hmm… Provided we preserve the grounds' Beauclairois stylings, and on condition you are not considering something like, oh, digging vast holes in which to store monster carcasses or bury cursed treasure, I am very much in favor, sir.
   1188014|00000000||Feels like by investing a bit of coin, I could make the house more functional.
   1188016|00000000||I agree thoroughly. With every fiber of my being.
   1188022|00000000||Yeah, give her a good sprucing up.
   1188152|00000000||It's in your hands, then. Make the place shine.
   1188154|00000000||I shall get to work immediately. Within a day's passing I shall have sent for the crew which rebuffed the admiral's residence. They are the finest specialists around.
   1190016|00000000||Highly skilled at what they do, it shall not take them too long, I wager. Two days after they begin your eyes will behold your residence in its refurbished, rejuvenated, beautified state.
   1188186|00000000||Fine, order the racks.
   1188188|00000000||Of course, at once. At most one day for them to arrive, is my estimation.
   1188026|00000000||Order some weapon racks. [Two additional racks.]
   1188027|00000000||Never mind.
   1187508|00000000||Could use another weapon rack. Got some interesting pieces I'd like to display.
   1188184|00000000||I know of a carpentry shop in town which crafts the humblest lumber into true masterpieces. You need but give the word.
   1187175|00000000||Order another weapon rack.
   1188192|00000000||Yes, just please make sure they're solidly made… and nicely finished.
   1188194|00000000||It goes without saying, sir. There is nothing worse than splendid armor upon a subpar stand.
   1190018|00000000||By this time tomorrow, they shall be ready to display your finest finds.
   1188028|00000000||Yes, have armor stands installed. [Two additional armor stands.]
   1188029|00000000||No, not now.
   1187510|00000000||Along the Path, I've often picked up well crafted, beautifully ornamented armor. Some of those pieces would look great on display here.
   1188190|00000000||I agree, it would lend the place a certain witchers' air. Shall I order new stands at once, sir?
   1187176|00000000||I need more armor stands.
   1188198|00000000||Yeah, sooner we start on that, the better.
   1188200|00000000||I can tell a man of action immediately. I'll see to it myself. The room shall be ready in two days, in my opinion.
   1188030|00000000||Fine, have the guest room refurbished.
   1188031|00000000||Lemme think it over.
   1187512|00000000||Was wondering about the guest room. Not that I'm expecting company, but…
   1188196|00000000||Oh, but that is immaterial! All self-respecting homes should boast a comfortable guest room. What if someone were to drop by unannounced?
   1187177|00000000||Let's see to the guest room.
   1187180|00000000||Could use a grindstone to sharpen my swords.
   1187504|00000000||In my trade, my blades get dull pretty quick. Could use a grindstone, professional-grade .
   1188226|00000000||Of course. No one will consider that an unnecessary extravagance, I would wager.
   1188033|00000000||Might be better to wait.
   1187181|00000000||Roach deserves a roomier stable.
   1187514|00000000||You know Roach, my horse… Well, we've been through a lot together. And since I've finally got a decent place to stay, think she deserves one, too.
   1188236|00000000||Ooh, a sturdy stable testifies to a most honorable owner! Just say the word and I'll have them start working on it at once.
   1188240|00000000||My Roach deserves the best. Have them refurbish the stables.
   1188242|00000000||I shall get to work at once. Yet finding workmen and completing construction takes time, though likely no more than two days…
   1188036|00000000||Yeah, I'd really like a decent stable. [Bonus to horse's Stamina.]
   1188037|00000000||Need to think it over.
   1187182|00000000||Herbs in the garden - that's what I want.
   1187516|00000000||So, sometimes I have to brew a potion, but I can't find the herbs I need growing anywhere nearby…
   1188244|00000000||Well, you're in luck, sir! The flower garden once kept by Madame Nina, Monsieur Bolius' wife, seems the ideal place to cultivate herbs! In fact, it's roomy enough to plant shrubbery!
   1188246|00000000||Good idea, Barnabas-Basil. Herbs there will save me hours of painstaking searching and harvesting.
   1188248|00000000||The idea is yours, sir, I am but the humble executor of your will. I believe we shall have sewn the first seeds in two days' time.
   1188038|00000000||Let's do it - plant herbs in the garden. [Ability to sow herbs.]
   1188039|00000000||Not a great idea.
   1188047|00000000||Hmm… know what? Might not be the best time to lay out that kind of coin. Lemme sleep on it.
   1188234|00000000||Ponder the notion however long you wish, sir. I am at your disposal always.
   1188035|00000000||Never mind.
   1188034|00000000||Order a grindstone.
   1188230|00000000||Then send out for one, please. A high-quality stone to be set up in the yard.
   1188232|00000000||Of course, I shall send a runner to town at once. I believe you shall be grinding to your heart's content by… tomorrow.
   1199948|00000000||Will you be needing anything else, sir?
   1188224|00000000||Good. Order me up a table like that.
   1190026|00000000||Immediately, sir. I expect it will take at most one day to arrive.
   1188032|00000000||Order a table.
   1187502|00000000||My armor needs work from time to time - you know, oil this, reinforce that… Could use a decent work table where I could do all that.
   1188222|00000000||Admiral Rompally once hired a specialist who made the finest armorer's tables this side of the Yaruga. I will contact him at once.
   1187179|00000000||Need an armor repair table.
   1188210|00000000||See you later.
   1180463|00000000||So long.
   1180337|00000000||Thanks. Gotta get back to my business now. See you soon.
   1208954|00000000||Greetings, sir. I am Barnabas-Basil Foulty. By order of our dearly departed duchess, I shall serve you as majordomo of Corvo Bianco.
   1193325|00000000||Welcome home, sir. I am Barnabas-Basil Foulty. By order of the duchess, I shall serve you as majordomo of Corvo Bianco.
   1207818|00000000||Prior to undertaking anything in that regard, sir, I feel I should inform you that someone has been awaiting you arrival.
   1207820|00000000||Who might that be?
   1207822|00000000||You must forgive me. I do not know, alas. Your guest failed to give a name.
   1207824|00000000||One last request before you go in to see them - please come and find me afterwards. I have yet to give you a tour of the estate.
   1185136|00000000||I previously served with distinction at the Kniebihly family manor and in Nazair with Admiral Rompally, who, as you are certain to know, is an extraordinary demanding gentleman…
   1180485|00000000||Whoa, Barnabas-Basil. One thing you oughta know - I'm not your typical landed gentleman. Truth be told, this is the first real property I've ever owned…
   1185138|00000000||Ooh, in that case, you must leave it all to me! I shall organize, see to everything and whip the house into order. I daresay this place will soon be the most prosperous vineyard around!
   1185140|00000000||Great, can already see I'm in good hands.
   1193323|00000000||A pleasure to welcome you once again to the as yet humble confines of Corvo Bianco. When last we met, I did not get the opportunity to present my credentials. With your permission, I shall do so now.
   1196152|00000000||You must forgive me my temerity, sir, but I thought, with all the work on Corvo Bianco completed, and with the estate looking more beautiful than ever, it might be appropriate to commemorate the moment…
   1196354|00000000||… and then he ran straight into the crowd, burning bouquet in hand. All thought it a part of the performance, so they only laughed - even when the décor began to catch fire.
   1196356|00000000||It was not until the flames engulfed Baron Marhevkin's beard that folk began to realize something was amiss and went to put out the fires.
   1196390|00000000||Hahaha, sounds like Monsieur Bolius and Madame Nina threw some first-rate balls here…
   1196392|00000000||It was so. In this regard, Baron Rossell was decidedly more reserved.
   1196394|00000000||So tell me, Barnabas-Basil, what's the wine situation like here? Am I gonna produce any this year?
   1196396|00000000||This year is out, I fear, sir. Last autumn a fungus destroyed all the vines. Baron Rossell had new ones planted, but it will be some time before they start bearing fruit. Assuming, that is, the fungus does not reappear.
   1196398|00000000||Mhh, that'd be bad. This Sepremento got me dreaming - it's amazing…
   1196401|00000000||Isn't it, though? Allow me to top you off, sir… There…
   1196403|00000000||Thanks.
   1196346|00000000||Sure, why not.
   1196349|00000000||During the tidying that preceded the renovations, I came across a bottle of Sepremento, the 1250 vintage. I cannot say by what miracle it survived, but it is here. And we've cause to open it today.
   1196699|00000000||Sure, we should celebrate.
   1196706|00000000||Thanks, B.B., but I'm afraid duty calls. Won't mind if you wanna have a drink, though.
   1196708|00000000||Why no, sir, I wouldn't dare…
   1196710|00000000||Wouldn't worry about it. I'm not really one for celebrations, but I'm serious - go ahead, knock one back. You've earned it.
   1196712|00000000||Very well, sir. If you insist. I thank you.
   1196700|00000000||Don't have time.
   1187891|00000000||I am delighted to inform you we have completed our labors. You can now devote yourself to enjoying the vineyard's delights to the fullest.
   1188110|00000000||Renovations coming along all right?
   1190704|00000000||You mean the lab in the cellar? Saw it. So, one of the previous owners interested in alchemy?
   1196156|00000000||A laboratory? Alchemy? I know nothing of it. But I understand that to a witcher this must be a very intriguing find.
   1196158|00000000||It is. It was walled up. Equipment's pretty ancient, too, so it must've belonged to someone who lived at Corvo Bianco before you started working here.
   1196160|00000000||Whoever it was sure knew their stuff, though. Got dragon glass vials and flasks, stills, sublimators, vengerometers…
   1196162|00000000||Forgive me, sir, but I fear I don't follow.
   1196164|00000000||Just saying it's top-notch equipment, true masterpieces of craftsmanship for use in alchemy. Brewing a concoction with this stuff versus doing it over an open fire - well, there's no comparison.
   1196341|00000000||Then I am all the more delighted you discovered it, sir.
   1196154|00000000||B. B., know anything about the laboratory in the cellar? One of the previous owners take an interest in alchemy?
   1209380|00000000||Sir, we received a shipment of wine. From the Belgaard Vineyard, I believe, with kind regards from Madame Matilda and Monsieur Liam.
   1209395|00000000||I had the barrels unloaded and stored in the cellar, to the right of the entrance.
   1209382|00000000||Thanks. Take a look when I have a moment.
   1209397|00000000||Splendid. I was told to expect a subsequent delivery five days hence.
   1187880|00000000||Wonderfully! The furnishings you last had me order have arrived.
   1187882|00000000||Very well indeed, sir. At this rate Corvo Bianco will soon be restored to its former glory.
   1187884|00000000||You ought to be the final judge of that, sir. Yet in my humble opinion, they are progressing splendidly. The laborers have completed all the general renovations. Also, the furnishings you had me order have arrived.
   1180487|00000000||How might I be of service, sir?
   1189533|00000000||Renovations coming along all right, Barnabas-Basil?
   1190030|00000000||Superbly, sir! General refurbishment has been completed, and I took the liberty of adding two racks each upon which you might hang weapons and armor, if you've some pieces you'd like to display. Likewise, I have prepared a few spots in which new paintings might be hung.
   1190032|00000000||In other news, the laborers dusting out the cellar have made a most unusual discovery… I believe it's something you'll wish to see.
   1190036|00000000||Fine, but maybe later. Something I'd like to ask you right now.
   1190038|00000000||I am all ears.
   1190034|00000000||I'll look at it later.
   1190033|00000000||I'll go there right now.
   1190040|00000000||If you say I should see it, I'll go see it right now, B.B.
   1187168|00000000||So long.
   1187019|00000000||That's all for now, B.B. Thanks.
   1188218|00000000||Let's put a pin in this for now. Remembered I have some urgent business to tend to.
   1188220|00000000||Not the slightest problem, sir. I am here to serve whenever you desire.
   1188209|00000000||So long.
   1187183|00000000||We'll discuss this later. Like to talk about something else.
   1187193|00000000||If you don't mind, I'd rather postpone talking about renovations. Need to ask you something else.
   1188216|00000000||Of course, sir, as you wish. What is the nature of your inquiry?
   1187178|00000000||Let's talk about something else.
   1187174|00000000||Could use a better bed.
   1188164|00000000||Thinking about buying a comfortable bed. Always wanted one…
   1187506|00000000||Excellent idea! In your profession, rest is supremely important. But say the word and I shall order you a bed from the carpenters who craft comfort for the court.
   1188025|00000000||Nah, don't want a new bed just now.
   1188024|00000000||Order a new bed. [Bonus to Vitality.]
   1188168|00000000||Great, order me a fine bed, please. Think I deserve one at my age…
   1188178|00000000||True indeed, true indeed, I shall send a runner at once. The bed will be in place by this time tomorrow.
   1188043|00000000||Is there anything, anything else you require, sir?
   1189548|00000000||Indeed, momentum is best maintained once established. Now that we've finished the general renovations, you might begin to consider such things as a new bed or additional armor stands or weapon racks. Also, some new furnishings and a fresh coat of paint on the walls would do much to improve the guest quarters.
   1187580|00000000||With the utmost respect, sir, the vineyard has arrived at the pinnacle of perfection. Any further changes could prove a regrettable step down the slope towards the brash. I firmly advise against it.
   1187566|00000000||I agree, yet I would urge you to hold off on further construction until the ongoing work is done. Juggling can be a challenging art. It's best not to undertake too much at once.
   1189554|00000000||What a splendidly wise idea! Now that the general refurbishment is done, why not see to the grounds? Perhaps renovate the stables, or return Madame Bolius' garden to its former verdancy?
   1190010|00000000||With the general refurbishment now done, I would advise you consider breathing new life into the stable and the garden.
   1189552|00000000||The way I see things, given your trade, sir, you would be wise to put in a grindstone and an armorer's table. A good way to start things off, don't you think?
   1190012|00000000||Starting to get into this whole renovating thing. There must be other things we can improve.
   1187166|00000000||The grounds - be nice to improve those.
   1187015|00000000||Know what? Changed my mind. Not in the mood to talk about redecoration today. But I wanted to ask you something else.
   1187017|00000000||I shall be glad to answer your every question, sir.
   1187167|00000000||We'll discuss this later. Rather broach some other topic now.
   1187165|00000000||Let's do some work on the house.
   1188146|00000000||Been thinking about the outer walls… maybe a fresh coat of paint, or some patching?
   1187500|00000000||If I might dare to make a suggestion - why not start with a general renovation? I once oversaw such work at Admiral Rompally's summer residence. The effects were simply breathtaking!
   1188148|00000000||Not only did the residence positively sparkle afterwards, but we also made room to display the admiral's armor and weapons, of which he was a passionate collector.
   1188023|00000000||Never mind.
   1188045|00000000||Hmm… need to think it over some.
   1188160|00000000||I understand, of course. As the venerable Lady Eeve Kniebihly would so quaintly put it - the rash oft contract rashes.
   1208436|00000000||As you wish, sir. Shall we see to the house or the grounds this time?
   1189988|00000000||Starting to really like this place. Maybe we should keep going, refurbish some more? What do you think, B.B.?
   1208774|00000000||Been thinking about the, uh, renovations we could do…
   1208776|00000000||In light of the current situation in Beauclair, I fear we must postpone any additional work you might wish to initiate…
   1208888|00000000||Right, got vampires in town to tend to. Thanks for reminding me.
   1185149|00000000||Asked about our guest earlier. Sorry, I was busy with my hunt, didn't have time to answer…
   1185151|00000000||When one gazes at that unfortunate creature, the question "what ever happened here" asks itself…
   1178331|00000000||So I took her by the hand and led her here. Seemed the only sensible place for her.
   1180233|00000000||You did the right thing, sir. She should recover quickly here.
   1180235|00000000||I'm deeply pleased finally to make your acquaintance, sir, though I do regret the specific circumstances. In all the commotion I fear I neglected to introduce myself. I'm Barnabas-Basil Foulty and by order of the duchess, I am to serve you as majordomo at Corvo Bianco.
   1180239|00000000||Nice to meet you, Barnabas-Basil. Love to talk more, but got urgent matters to attend to. While I'm gone, please make sure she gets everything she needs.
   1180244|00000000||No worries, sir. I shall see to everything. She is safe here and in good hands. She'll soon be back on her feet.
   1180248|00000000||Might actually take a while - she hadn't eaten anything in over a hundred years when I found her…
   1180250|00000000||Horrid… whatever brought this about?
   1180326|00000000||Rather not go into it.
   1180333|00000000||It's all over, that's what matters. Let's now focus on taking care of Marlene.
   1180335|00000000||Naturally. I shall see to it.
   1180257|00000000||In a hurry. We'll talk about this later.
   1180256|00000000||She was cursed.
   1186358|00000000||Told me her story on the way here.
   1180275|00000000||Her name's Marlene. She was once the very beautiful and proud heiress to the Trastamara estate.
   1180277|00000000||One evening, when she was holding a banquet for friends, a beggar came to her gate seeking alms. He had a bowl and a spoon with him. He sat outside her fence and waited.
   1180291|00000000||I've heard of the custom - an ancient right of hospitality that obliges one to give food and drink to such a guest lest he depart hungry. To neglect the custom is to bring great misfortune down upon oneself.
   1180293|00000000||Marlene didn't care a whit for the old customs. She drove the man off, saying she'd rather feed the leftovers from her feast to her dogs than to give the beggar anything.
   1180297|00000000||The beggar then broke his spoon, cast a curse. She was beautiful, so he said she'd never wish to look at herself in the mirror again.
   1180303|00000000||Since she adored feasts, he swore no one would ever wish to sit and dine with her.
   1180299|00000000||And as she even refused him the crumbs from her table, he swore she'd never find a spoon in the world that would sate her hunger.
   1180324|00000000||A harsh punishment… I imagine lifting the curse was hardly simple…
   1180325|00000000||Did some thinking, figured it out, lemme tell you the story.
   1180339|00000000||Curses are tricky, they play on irony. Always gotta figure out what the catch is.
   1180341|00000000||Marlene had spent decades looking for a way to lift it. Transformed into a wight, she stole spoons and lured folk into her home, trying each time to get them to dine with her. Didn't work.
   1180312|00000000||So what did?
   1180343|00000000||Someone had to sit down and share a meal with her - of their own free will. They had to eat without using spoons and make her look at her reflection.
   1180345|00000000||That's it? That was all it required?
   1180347|00000000||Simplest solutions are sometimes the last that come to mind.
   1180349|00000000||Besides, when you're a wight, it's pretty damn hard to find willing human company for a feast.
   1180351|00000000||I imagine so… But most importantly it is now over. Please don't worry, she will be in good hands here.
   1196859|00000000||On the left is the master bedroom. On the right, the dining hall and kitchen. Upstairs you shall find the guest room, currently used for storage.
   1196861|00000000||Not a bad idea.
   1196863|00000000||At the moment, the house is only minimally furnished, yet I believe we will, together, devise some innovative arrangements. A few paintings, for instance, would breathe new life into the abode immediately.
   1196865|00000000||With that, sir, you've seen the full lay of the land… Corvo Bianco is a beautiful estate, though one must admit time has taken its toll.
   1196867|00000000||If… forgive me for being forward, but if you were to choose to invest a small sum towards its beautification, consider me at your service on the matter.
   1196869|00000000||Think I'll take you up on that. Be sure to come and see you if I decide to do any remodeling.
   1187887|00000000||This place - tell me more about it.
   1187000|00000000||Vineyard comes across as a place with a rich history. Know who owned it before me?
   1187002|00000000||Baron Rossell, who went bankrupt, forcing him to sell the estate to the duchess. The baron, in turn, had purchased it from Monsieur Bolius of the Headsmen… A truly colorful man, of Kaedweni origin.
   1188259|00000000||He was actually a headsman?
   1188261|00000000||No, not him, but his great-great-great-great-grandfather? Indeed. Apparently, he was a common cutpurse who somehow secured for himself the post of ducal headsman in Beauclair. Went about his work with an exceptional penchant. They say he chopped off more heads than there are grapevines in the ducal vineyards.
   1188263|00000000||He never hesitated, not once, never sliced unevenly, never botched a job. For his exemplary service, the duke granted him a title and this estate.
   1188265|00000000||Monsieur Bolius, on the other hand, was an engineer in his younger years. Once retired, he settled here and took to producing wine.
   1188267|00000000||Sadly, misfortune struck and he lost his sense first of smell, then of taste. Additionally, he could not drink alcohol - his medic forbade it.
   1188269|00000000||Shame, that. He give up making wine?
   1188271|00000000||Not at all! He made even more of it! Began throwing wild balls to which he'd invite friends from far and wide, in order to treat them to his wine and delight in the fact that at least someone could enjoy it. It's the sort of man he was, Monsieur Bolius.
   1197151|00000000||Ever play gwent?
   1197163|00000000||Up for a few rounds of gwent, B.B.?
   1197165|00000000||Oh, with great pleasure, sir. Ready?
   1197153|00000000||Ever play gwent, B. B.?
   1197155|00000000||Funny you should ask, sir. I was quite adept in my younger years. But that was so long ago… I fear I've limited my interest to collecting, now. Managed to assemble quite the set of decks.
   1200396|00000000||Huh. Sounds interesting. Mind showing me what you got?
   1200398|00000000||Not at all, sir, but only in action. A round or two, perhaps?
   1200638|00000000||This time I won. Would you be interested in a rematch, sir?
   1200640|00000000||I congratulate you on your victory. Shall we continue playing?
   1200402|00000000||Play as Nilfgaard.
   1200410|00000000||Yeah. You be Nilfgaard.
   1200403|00000000||Play as the Scoia'tael.
   1200412|00000000||Scoia'tael. Sound all right?
   1200404|00000000||Play your Monster deck.
   1200414|00000000||I'm a witcher, so Monsters.
   1200405|00000000||Play as Skellige.
   1200416|00000000||Skellige seems most appropriate for you.
   1200422|00000000||Middle of the road, let's.
   1200427|00000000||Hmm… maybe a… moderately strong deck? That should be fair.
   1200423|00000000||Weakest.
   1200429|00000000||Weakest. You mind?.
   1200431|00000000||At your service, sir. Well then - let us play.
   1200406|00000000||Surprise me.
   1200418|00000000||Not really. You choose.
   1200425|00000000||Feeling lucky today. Use your strongest.
   1200421|00000000||Strongest.
   1200420|00000000||As you wish. Would you prefer I use my strongest deck or a weaker one?
   1200408|00000000||Play as the Northern Realms, will you?
   1200401|00000000||Play as the Northern Realms.
   1197167|00000000||May the best man win.
   1200400|00000000||Do you wish to play against any particular faction, sir?
   1197160|00000000||Let's play.
   1197161|00000000||Maybe later.
   1197169|00000000||Maybe later. Got something I need to do right now.
   1197171|00000000||As you wish, sir.
   1187004|00000000||Mind giving me a little tour de Corvo Bianco?
   1187006|00000000||Not in the least. Follow me, please. I think it would be practical to begin on the hill.
   1187888|00000000||Show me around the vineyard?
   1180462|00000000||Marlene - I could tell you about her if you want.
   1189828|00000000||Behold, sir, your estate, in all its splendor.
   1192685|00000000||Pretty vast…
   1192687|00000000||Indeed. And now, sir, allow me to show you a handful of interesting details. Follow me, please.
   1195276|00000000||Gods save me!
   1195278|00000000||Stay calm. Just stay calm!
   1195280|00000000||La la la lala la.
   1206628|00000000||Guillaume de Launfal was the very model of a knight errant – the placard boy for Toussaint, if you will. When Geralt first met the young man, he was valiantly tilting at a windmill… which, to be fair, turned out to be hiding a ferocious giant.<br>
   1206629|00000000||The matter turned out, as is matters’ wont in Toussaint, to be an affair of the heart. Guillaume was tormented by unrequited love for the duchess’ lady-in-waiting, Vivienne de Tabris. He suspected her frigidness and distance must be the result of some malicious curse. Geralt, a professional curse-breaker, naturally took the contract. To get a chance at an audience with Lady Vivienne, he had to take the wounded Guillaume’s place in the knights’ tourney.<br>
   1206630|00000000||The witcher determined Vivienne was indeed afflicted by a curse and had been since before she was born, a dark malediction which caused her to transform into a bird every night. Geralt offered to try to cure this cumbersome condition.<br><br>He reported back to Guillaume on what he had learned. Guillaume rose to the occasion and offered to take the curse upon himself in order to free Vivienne from it.<br>
   1206631|00000000||The witcher determined Vivienne was indeed afflicted by a curse and had been since before she was born, a dark malediction which caused her to transform into a bird every night. Geralt offered to try to cure this cumbersome condition. Vivienne asked him not to reveal her secret to anyone, so Geralt did not tell Guillaume about his plans.<br>
   1206632|00000000||Guillaume convinced Vivienne to undergo a ritual which would transfer her curse to him. According to Geralt, once transferred the curse’s effects would be weakened, but he was not able to make any guarantees concerning the young knight’s fate.<br><br>As soon as they had performed the ritual, Vivienne felt the curse had been lifted. As for Guillaume, he did not notice any significant side effects.<br>
   1206633|00000000||Geralt performed a ritual freeing Vivienne from the curse. She decided to travel abroad in order to enjoy the life she had left to the utmost.<br>
   1206634|00000000||Guillaume and Vivienne’s story had a happy ending. Geralt ran into the couple in Beauclair. It turned out Guillaume had grown a few feathers on certain parts of his body. Vivienne considered them rather flattering, so all was well.
   1206635|00000000||Guillaume felt like he had been rejected and drowned his sorrows in wine. Geralt tried to explain to him one cannot force love on anyone.
   1210266|00000000||Geralt never found a moment to spare to help the lovelorn Guillaume with his dilemma.<br><br>Sadly, Guillaume later died when the vampires attacked Beauclair. Geralt happened across his body. It seemed Guillaume had died in battle, defending the city from a terrifying threat.<br><br>Geralt contemplated what the fate of Guillaume and Vivienne might have been, had the vampire onslaught not occurred.<br><br>Personally, I feel myself choked with sadness when thinking about poor Guillaume… perhaps I’ll compose a ballad in which the two star-crossed lovers live happily ever after?<br><br>It can be done. In poetry, anything can be done.
   1211861|00000000||Getting himself into trouble clearly counted among Guillaume’s favorite hobbies. The second time Geralt met him, he had to rescue the knight from an enraged shaelmaar trying its best to rip him to shreds in a packed arena.<br><br>Wounded yet grateful, Guillaume asked the witcher to meet with him about a very urgent matter.<br>

   1156948|00000000||Mind showing me what you're selling?
   1156944|00000000||Show me what you have in stock.
   1156954|00000000||See you later.
   1156946|00000000||See you.
   1156945|00000000||Caves all peaceful now? No trouble?
   1156950|00000000||Caves peaceful now? No more trouble?
   1156952|00000000||None… But why do you ask?
   1184013|00000000||Shaelmaars're hard sometimes to get rid of for good. Live deep underground, no way to get at them… until they get hungry. Then they surface to feed.
   1184015|00000000||Ah…aha. And what am I to do then?
   1184017|00000000||Send for me. Give you my discount for regular customers.
   1175425|00000000||The witcher who sees the future! What will be? Will you help?
   1175421|00000000||You, sir, are a witcher? The very one the duquessa summoned?
   1175423|00000000||Guilty as charged. And you gotta be someone who wants something from me.
   1184001|00000000||It's like you read my mind! You see… those caves are like cellars the gods carved out for their own stores. Spacious, dry…
   1184003|00000000||Just some monster lives inside 'em.
   1184005|00000000||A soothsayer! Gods be gelded, a soothsayer! So, will you help?
   1175429|00000000||Sure, I'll see to it. For the sizable reward I foresee you giving me.
   1175426|00000000||Yeah, I'll take care of it.
   1175411|00000000||So? Well?
   1175433|00000000||Haven't seen to your problem just yet. A little patient, huh?
   1175431|00000000||Sorry, can't help you at the moment.
   1175427|00000000||Nothing I can do just now.
   1210243|00000000||Need to agree my fee first.
   1210245|00000000||Might help, might not. Depends on whether we can agree on a fee.
   1210247|00000000||My, my, we clearly think highly of ourselves. I don't have it.
   1210249|00000000||Well, nearly there…
   1210251|00000000||Good, yes. So be it.
   1210253|00000000||I cannot know what the duquessa's pledged to pay you, but I simply don't have that much.
   1175417|00000000||Problem solved. Shaelmaar that lived in the cave won't pester you any more.
   1175419|00000000||Suuuu-perb! I've gained a warehouse… And you've gained my gratitude!
   1156943|00000000||Ah! My witcher friend! Greetings, greetings!
   1175435|00000000||Hey-ho! Master witcher!
   1205337|0592c167||Flaggan
   1205803|00000000||This is deathly dull. Let's go.
   1205805|00000000||You're bored as you've made no effort to understand. It's a metaphor of the constant struggle for power and influence.
   1205807|00000000||Pfff, a metaphor… What else will they think of?
   1205809|00000000||If they can't agree, they ought to cut the line. Adieu, the constant struggle.
   1113425|00000000||Well? Have you recovered Reginald's family jewels?
   1114632|00000000||Destroyed…? But--
   1150888|00000000||Nothing I could do. Sorry.
   1150890|00000000||This monument is my life, my livelihood! I've spent years at its side, protecting it from rain, hail, birds and their corrosive droppings…
   1152102|00000000||Sounds like you got plenty of experience. Should have no trouble finding another job in the industry…
   1114925|00000000||You might think this but a silly statue, but a great many folk depended on those stones.
   1114927|00000000||Fewer children will be born now, ladies will walk about unsatisfied, their men dejected… Not to mention the sad fate of a certain curator of art and collectibles.
   1146927|00000000||Ehh, all is lost.
   1151001|00000000||Buck up. You'll figure something out. I'm sure of it. Take care, now.
   1111672|00000000||Uh, they were destroyed, unfortunately…
   1099587|00000000||Yep. Got them back.
   1099589|00000000||Lebioda's luscious lips, it's them! It's really them! I hope this modest reward nonetheless conveys the extent of my gratitude…
   1113431|00000000||And look in on us tomorrow for the grand reopening. You shall stroke Reginald at no charge! On the house!
   1099015|00000000||Any suspects?
   1099019|00000000||Got any suspects?
   1099021|00000000||Considering the vast potency of Reginald's prized pouch, everyone's a suspect. Who would not want it for himself?
   1104733|00000000||When'd they disappear?
   1104735|00000000||Any idea when the theft took place?
   1104737|00000000||It must have been mere hours ago. I guided the last group through the exposition quite recently. The stones were very much in place.
   1150886|00000000||Reginald - tell me what you know.
   1150980|00000000||Got my attention. Now tell me about this Reginald, all you know.
   1150982|00000000||There's so much to tell! Legend has it he and the architect Faramond planned and laid out Beauclair.
   1150984|00000000||Mh. Impressed already.
   1150986|00000000||In particular, Reginald took great pains to devise escape routes for lovers caught with their pants down - literally and metaphorically.
   1150990|00000000||He later made frequent use of them himself. Not out of fear, mind you, but to avoid having to kill his rivals in duels.
   1098711|00000000||Here it is. Our pride and joy - Reginald d'Aubry. A giant among lovers, a poking, puncturing swordsman, and atop all that an unrivaled diddler of harps and other organs.
   1112335|00000000||Mhm… So, what's wrong with it?
   1112337|00000000||How should I put this… Ahh, it's lost its jewels.
   1112339|00000000||Somebody stole the testicles. Off a statue.
   1112341|00000000||No ordinary statue, mind you! The sole monument made using a cast of the great Reginald's own genitals - certified and authenticated!
   1114611|00000000||Sprung directly from his loins, they grant all who stroke them unparalleled virility! All who buy a ticket, that is.
   1114613|00000000||Thus, you must retrieve those stones!
   1104732|00000000||Need to look around.
   1104739|00000000||Need to look around. Might find a clue or two.
   1104741|00000000||Do what you must, as long as you return grasping Reginald's stones! Without them, Beauclair's entire tourist sector faces trying times, trying times!
   1104745|00000000||I thank you for your help… Lebioda reward you with copious offspring!
   1151657|00000000||Please hurry. Beauclair's future lies in the balance. As does mine.
   1153702|00000000||Reginald d'Aubry has returned! Not to be missed! Buy your tickets now! Available from me alone!
   1196834|00000000||Now where'd that bloodsucker go?
   1196836|00000000||Won't be easy to track down. He is a… vampire, after all.
   1196843|00000000||Dammit, where'd you go?
   1196841|00000000||Regis!
   1189326|00000000||I'm done, dead on my feet.
   1196542|00000000||Stop complaining. This is far from the worst job, even with all the maniacs we must serve.
   1196544|00000000||Yet it's equally far from being the best. I've mopped up so much sick this week, I feel as if I work in a cesspit.
   1196546|00000000||Artists must drink a great deal in order to create, or so I've heard. And the public must drink just as much to understand.

   1205138|00000000||Ducal guardsmen commanded by Captain Damien de la Tour were to aid Geralt in storming Dun Tynne - this was the duchess' wish and command. The briefing before the assault would be held at the mill where Dettlaff had recently dispatched Count de la Croix in cold blood.<br>
   1205177|00000000||Within Dun Tynne's walls, the witcher came upon Roderick. The old knight had erred many times in his life, yet never as gravely as he had when opening his castle to a group of bandits, a vandaguild. He had been persuaded to do so by none other than Syanna, Duchess Anny Henrietta's sister. The young woman had clearly captured the lord of Dun Tynne's affections, or perhaps merely aroused his passions. This achieved, she had quickly wrapped him round her finger. Interestingly, Roderick seemed to know Syanna well, yet he had heard nothing of her abduction. Having questioned the wounded knight as much as he wished, Geralt set off for the castle's keep, in a room of which he expected to find Anna Henrietta's dear sibling.<br>
   1205194|00000000||While storming Dun Tynne, Geralt was surprised to find he had two allies - Regis and Dettlaff. Naturally, the witcher assisted by two higher vampires plowed through the castle's defenders about like the Nilfgaardian conflagration had plowed through Cintra. At long last they reached the room where Geralt expected to find Syanna… And he was not disappointed. Yet it turned out Syanna was not just the young lady banished from court those many years ago. No, she was also Rhena, the missing, presumed-to-be-kidnapped young woman who was Dettlaff's beloved. The witcher and company learned she had controlled the Cintrian, bidding him to steal Sangreal wine as well as the ducal jewel. She had also sent Dettlaff the names of the intended victims. The vampire needed all his strength to quell his desire to tear her to shreds then and there. He seemed a shard of ice as he set a meeting time and place - Syanna was to appear at Tesham Mutna three days hence to explain herself. The witcher found himself between a rock and a hard place. One the one hand, a vampire consumed by fury demanded he deliver Syanna to him in three days' time. On the other hand, Anna Henrietta awaited, expecting Dettlaff's head on a silver platter.<br>
   1181083|00000000||Search Dun Tynne for Syanna and Rhena.
   1181084|00000000||Defeat Roderick and his men.
   1181085|00000000||Defeat the guards and reach Dun Tynne's keep.
   1183329|00000000||Meet Damien at Count de la Croix's mill after midnight.
   1189919|00000000||Tell Damien when you're ready to storm the castle.
   1157072|00000000||Capture the Castle

   1181134|00000000||Champion, it is an honor to meet you!
   1181132|00000000||Can't wait to take my vows. Then, off to battle!
   1181130|00000000||Monsters, wildcats, bandits! Tremble all, for I come!
   1181138|00000000||Attentive and prepared to serve.
   1181136|00000000||Sir?
   1152286|00000000||So long.
   1178433|00000000||Good luck on the Path!
   1152282|00000000||Farewell.
   1152281|00000000||Show me your wares?

Remember the hideous barghests which scourged them and repent!<br>– "Sermons for Feasts and Funerals," by the Reverend Yomen of Tretogor</i><br><br>Folk of simple or superstitious minds claim committing particularly rotten acts will bring down the wrath of the gods in the form of “barghests,” phantom dogs which stalk the roads at night. Even if this were their origin, barghests saints and sinners alike would need fear barghests, for they attack both with equal ferocity. Witchers rarely believe in the gods, but they do accept that barghests exist and are always connected with some sequence of tragic events that happened in the past. Their explanation, however, holds that barghests result from a curse or a concentration of ill will.<br>
   1208637|00000000||Barghests, like wolves, are stronger in packs. Together they surround their prey, leaping at it and tearing it apart with their teeth. If their prey defends itself too determinedly, they strike it with a blast of phantom fire.

   1206941|00000000||While exploring the abandoned Casteldaccia Estate, Geralt found it haunted by the specter of a knight. After a long and hard fight, he defeated the apparition. He searched the area where they had fought and spotted a note…<br>
   1206942|00000000||He learned of Maximus Macrinus, a knight cruelly murdered along with his family by marauders from Filibert Fourfingers' hanse. The note also hinted at the existence of a hidden treasure…<br>

   1162897|00000000||Gray as monk's moanings yet still stupid.
   1162895|00000000||You, little boy gray - flit off.
   1162899|00000000||You bleeding waster!
   1162901|00000000||Now you've gone and riled me…
   1162903|00000000||Something wrong, friend?
   1188671|00000000||Brute!
   1188675|00000000||These knights of ours should turn their attentions to the vandaguilds, not parade about in tourneys!
   1188679|00000000||Behold, our hero! Geralt of Rivia!
   1188677|00000000||I'm glad to see Her Illustrious Grace summoned such a professional.
   1188673|00000000||You've the gall to show your face around here? Still?
   1188685|00000000||No. Perhaps, yes…? Oh, I don't know.
   1188681|00000000||Good health to you.
   1188683|00000000||Help!
   1161495|00000000||We must go to where the game is being held.
   1161497|00000000||The participants must find a unicorn's horn, a golden fish and a phoenix egg.
   1199429|00000000||With these in hand, they can deduce where the Hare, Milton, hides.
   1199431|00000000||Mean we need to find those things, too?
   1199433|00000000||We've no other option. But time is of the essence, so we shall have to break the rules.
   1165508|00000000||Oop, yep, I'm going to heave…
   1165506|00000000||Don't give me that look! It was something I ate, something off!
   1165512|00000000||Urghm, those oysters must have turned…
   1165510|00000000||I had one glass! With dinner!
   1166599|00000000||Thank you, witcher.
   1163814|00000000||H-h-halt! Wh-who g-goes there?! Wh-what's your b-business at the c-c-cemetery?
   1163816|00000000||I'm a witcher. Wraiths haunt your catacombs.
   1163818|00000000||Ah, so it's true what old Lanzano said… about the racket at the cemetery. I thought it grave robbers, perhaps, but wraiths…?! Have you… uh…?
   1163820|00000000||Took care of them. This Lanzano - think he might pay me for solving his problem?
   1163822|00000000||Oh, that's more than certain! Look for him at the Clever Clogs.
   1168208|00000000||Thanks.
   1166639|00000000||Lebioda's wounds! What was that…?!
   1152345|00000000||Magic beans. Do you have any?
   1152347|00000000||If it's not the new name of some kicker I already have, dearies - then no. But maybe you'd like some--
   1152424|00000000||What is it, loves? What is it you want?
   1154148|00000000||The ribbon - mind explaining what the fuss is about?
   1154150|00000000||There's not much to explain. I got it from Artorius Vigo when I was a child. It was to protect me from evil. It clearly didn't work, given how I ended up…
   1154152|00000000||But it means a lot to you.
   1154154|00000000||How should I put this… I have so few mementos from my childhood.
   1154156|00000000||And the ribbon reminds me of the good old days… when I was someone else.
   1154158|00000000||Dears… could you continue this touching scene elsewhere, hm? You're scaring away my customers.
   1154136|00000000||What's the deal with the ribbon?
   1154305|00000000||All right. Let's play. If you lose, you give me the ribbon.
   1154307|00000000||Don't get your hopes up. None can best me at gwent.
   1154228|00000000||Let's play cards for the ribbon.
   1154324|00000000||You lost, friend. So if you still want that ribbon, you've got to pay up.
   1152444|00000000||Rumpole, you're good at this. A word once given… the ribbon's yours. Now, skedaddle.
   1154339|00000000||All right. Tell me.
   1154341|00000000||What?
   1154343|00000000||What you want in return. You're not doing this out of the kindness of your heart.
   1154346|00000000||Don't want anything in return.
   1168177|00000000||I… Hm. Thank you.
   1154326|00000000||Fine, I'll pay you for the ribbon. This enough?
   1154328|00000000||It's enough. Now go away.
   1154229|00000000||I'll pay you for the ribbon.
   1163065|00000000||What have you got to sell, exactly?
   1164330|00000000||Like I said - tobacco, fisstech… All sorts of things. Have a look.
   1163063|00000000||What else do you have to sell?
   1154230|00000000||Let's get out of here.
   1154145|00000000||Wasting time here, Syanna. Let's go.
   1154137|00000000||Let's get out of here.
   1154135|00000000||C'mon, give Syanna the ribbon.
   1154173|00000000||Give Syanna the ribbon. Why not, huh?
   1154175|00000000||Sugarplum, the only thing I hand out for free is a first hit. To get them to come back for a second, of course. For all else, you've got to pay.
   1154177|00000000||What if asked you nicely?
   1154179|00000000||Ask me nicely and I might play you for it. A round of cards?
   1152353|00000000||Hey! Where'd you get that ribbon? That's mine!
   1152355|00000000||Is that so? Then why was it lying in the bushes? Finders keepers, sweetheart.
   1152349|00000000||Nothing. We just want to get out of here. As fast as we can.
   1152351|00000000||Sweet cheeks, two puffs of my stuff, and I guarantee you'll fly out of here as if--
   1152341|00000000||Care for a cigarillo? A bit of tobacco? A dab of fisstech?
   1152343|00000000||Uhhh… remind me, what tale are you from?
   1154134|00000000||Sold flints when I was a lass. But no one bought them, so I branched out. Now I deal in snuffs, puffs, all sorts of fun things. What'll you have, sweeties?
   1152452|00000000||Fliiiint! Ciiiigaaars! Piiiiipes! Rolling leaves!
   1154035|00000000||Tobacco of the highest caliber! Fisstech, pure as virgin tears!

   1207194|00000000||Milton’s murderer was very swift. Even with years of witchering under his belt, Geralt could barely keep up with him. Soon, it became clear the killer was as clever as he was fast, by entering an old warehouse where he set a trap for Geralt. In this way Geralt had his first face to face encounter with the Beast of Beauclair – and discovered it was a higher vampire named Dettlaff.<br><br>A fight immediately ensued which might have ended very badly for the witcher, had he not been saved in the nick of time by an old friend, Regis, who put a stop to their battle. After that, Dettlaff fled away in a puff of fog…<br>
   1208020|00000000||When Geralt went to Orianna’s residence with the duchess, he was certain Dettlaff was somewhere far away, safe in Regis’ care. He was wrong, as he found out while watching both vampires stroll into the room, his surprise quickly turning to irritation. In the conversation which followed, the duchess had no idea she was talking to the murderer she so wished to have slain. In fact, the Beast of Beauclair even came off as… charming.<br><br>Afterwards, Geralt set off for Dun Tynne, but not before first extracting a promise from Regis to keep Dettlaff at a safe distance this time.<br>
   1208021|00000000||At Dun Tynne Geralt was dragged into a fight against bandits with considerably superior forces at their disposal. There’s no knowing how this might have ended, had the proverbial cavalry not ridden to his rescue. Birds in service of Geralt’s vampire friends had been following him the whole time. Thanks to them, right at the battle’s pivotal moment, Dettlaff and Regis appeared to fight at his side.<br><br>Believing he was battling the men responsible for his beloved’s kidnapping, Dettlaff killed with unseen passion. He only stopped when there was not a being left on the battlefield giving out the least sign of life.<br>
   1208022|00000000||Upon learning the woman he loved was using him for her own ends, Dettlaff lost all will to keep on living. The only thing left to him was a longing for vengeance – blind, unrestrained vengeance. Dettlaff issued a clear ultimatum: Syanna was to meet with him alone and explain everything. If she failed to do that, Beauclair would be awash with blood. No one had any doubts Dettlaff meant exactly what he said.<br>
   1208023|00000000||Regis and Geralt brought Syanna to Dettlaff. The vampire then murdered her without blinking an eye, Geralt attacked him and a final fight took place in which Dettlaff was defeated. Yet no man can truly kill a higher vampire – that takes another higher vampire. As he died, Dettlaff harbored no hard feelings for Regis, knowing death was his best option, there no longer being anything in this world he wished to live for.<br><br>
   1208024|00000000||Geralt and Regis arrived at the meeting with Dettlaff, but without Syanna. As predicted, Dettlaff flew into a rage. This time, however, Geralt was ready for him and stood to fight. After an exhausting battle, Detlaff had been defeated.<br><br>Yet no man can truly kill a higher vampire – that takes another higher vampire. As he died, Dettlaff harbored no hard feelings for Regis, knowing death was his best option, there no longer being anything in this world he wished to live for.<br><br>
   1208025|00000000||Regis and Geralt brought Syanna to Dettlaff – and the vampire murdered her without blinking an eye. Geralt understood the vampire’s pain and did not hinder him in his vengeance. Dettlaff appreciated the witcher’s neutrality and stated he had no more quarrel with him. He also had no reason to stay in Beauclair and decided to leave. As his friend, Regis decided to go after him. He knew Dettlaff would need him now more than ever.<br><br>
   1208920|00000000||Regis and Geralt brought Syanna to Dettlaff. Clearly not having grown one iota less enraged with Syanna, Dettlaff slashed out at her with his razor-sharp claws, hoping to rip her to shreds. She was saved, however, by a magic ribbon taken from the Land of a Thousand Fables, which transported her to a safe place in the nick of time. Dettlaff, more furious than ever, then attacked Regis and Geralt. In the fight that ensued, Dettlaff was defeated. Yet no man can kill a higher vampire –that can only be done by another of its own kind. As he died, Dettlaff harbored no hard feelings for Regis, knowing this was the best option for him. There was no longer anything in this world he wished to live for.<br><br>

   1186300|00000000||Did you see our notice? Is that why you've come?
   1186302|00000000||Didn't see any notice, no. But since I'm here, be glad to hear you out, know the problem. This some kind of plague you fear?
   1201536|00000000||Yes, indeed! And a horrid one at that! We've irked the gods something true, we have. In Zerrikania, they sent a plague of locusts, then of frogs. With us, they skipped right to raining cows down on us.
   1186298|00000000||Enough! Enough! No need to sow panic. Come, master witcher, I shall divulge to you the matter at hand.
   1186278|00000000||Saw your notice. Got a problem with… a cow? Fear a plague, is that it?
   1172254|00000000||What the golly blasting devils are you doing, men?! What plague?! An unfortunate turns of events, that's all. Get back to chiseling! If we don't deliver that head on time, the investor will twist my plums off!
   1172256|00000000||Is that what you'll tell Emil's widow? That a cow crushed him, and it was an accident? This, sir, is a grave matter. It requires a specialist - some mage or warlock.
   1148269|00000000||What happened here?
   1148271|00000000||Look, it's that witcher who's come to town. Maybe he can do something? An exorcism or the like? We should ask how much coin he'll want.
   1203530|00000000||<i>Among the fascinating flora and fauna of the duchy of Toussaint, one also encounters creatures of the decidedly unpleasant sort, such as giant centipedes. Not only do these beasts look hideous to the eye, they can do colossal damage to the flesh as well. I decidedly advise against them.</i><br> – “A Visit to Toussaint,” one of the many guides authored by Peterin Safles<br><br>Giant centipedes are enormous, insect-like monsters which can be found in many places in the world, but are particularly common in the lands (or more precisely, under the lands) of Toussaint. There they often dwell in close comity with shaelmaars, for a sort of monstrous symbiosis has developed between them: giant centipedes feed on the small creatures which eat Shaelmaar dung.<br><br>Hard, chitinous armor covers nearly the entire body of a giant centipede. Sticking out from under this carapace are rows of hooked limbs. Giant centipedes are able to burrow into the ground with shocking speed, only to then appear back on the surface in another place. Once they select a target, they will circle it determinedly, trying to get close enough to deliver a blow. They attack primarily with their powerful mandibles, but they also possess glands allowing them to spew acid.<br>
   1203531|00000000||The greatest obstacle when fighting giant centipedes is their thick armor, which deflects most blows not only from weapons, but also from magical means – such as those dealt by simple spells or witcher Signs.<br><br>When attacked with a weapon, they will often parry the strike, then quickly reply with their own forceful counter. Thus the best method for fighting them is to catch them in an Yrden trap, keeping them from protecting themselves with their armor or burrowing into the ground.

   1170480|00000000||And had they discovered I don't have it, oooh, grim my fate would have been, indeed…
   1167659|00000000||Time we went our separate ways. Good luck - whatever you decide to do.
   1170492|00000000||I thank you, witcher. Fare thee well.
   1170482|00000000||So long.
   1170481|00000000||What'll you do now?
   1170484|00000000||So, what now?
   1170486|00000000||Ah, I fear I don't know. I can't possibly hope to rebuild my father's still… I suppose I must hang a shingle in the market, sell wine…
   1170488|00000000||Or perhaps I should move on, leave Toussaint? Alas, I know not and will have to see. Whatever the case, I shall not forget your help, with my brothers.
   1173710|00000000||Besides, you did not kill them. They will come to, soon, having learned a valuable lesson, I trust.
   1167553|00000000||They got what they deserved.
   1170474|00000000||Maybe they did mean well.
   1170476|00000000||I for one do not believe it. They were overcome with greed, ready to do anything to wrest the last part of the still from me.

   1189528|00000000||Canvas is cut. Somebody took a knife to the painting, looks like.
   1174011|00000000||Could still be here. Need to stay alert.
   1192861|00000000||Locked. And no key in sight.
   1197184|00000000||Sconce is bent… smeared with blood.
   1198591|00000000||Someone try to grab it?
   1174009|00000000||Jewel was in the box, it seems. Cintrian tried to steal it, but someone got in his way.
   1192351|00000000||They fought, struggled, that's clear… Ended with one of them flying out the window. Fall had to have killed them.
   1192353|00000000||Jewel's still here, though, so our Cintrian must've been the flier.
   1174013|00000000||Precious stone, bloody fingerprint on it. Thief came for this, must have.
   1192349|00000000||Tiny chain links next to it… From a snapped necklace? Seems there was a struggle.

   1189531|00000000||Looks valuable… but it's not what he came for.
   1174003|00000000||Bloodstains…
   1189202|00000000||Hm. Must've climbed this ladder.

   1189431|00000000||At long last the giant lay defeated, and the men who had vanquished it could make their introductions, then engage in the kind of conversation that oft happens over a fresh monster corpse. The young giant slayer gave the three arrivals fresh tidings - the Beast had struck again. The body of its most recent victim now lay on a riverbank nearby. Geralt decided he needed to see it and explore the crime scene, while Milton thought it both wise and courteous to accompany the witcher.<br>
   1189432|00000000||Geralt failed to find the victim's body on the riverbank. It seemed the Ducal Guard had removed it to the cool cellars of the Corvo Bianco Estate. Ever the ferreter, however, Geralt did spot something the soldiers had overlooked. Based on the item, and with Milton's help, he established the identity of the Beast's most recent victim. Yet he failed to divine the species, genus, or family of the creature that had perpetrated the crime. Only an autopsy could help him do that. So Geralt set off for Corvo Bianco, alone this time as duties at court had called Milton to the Ducal Palace.<br>
   1189433|00000000||Alas, something wicked had arrived at Corvo Bianco Vineyard. As the witcher drew near the estate, yet was still at some distance, battle sounds reached his ears. On arriving, he saw the bodies of guardsmen, murdered just moments before by a bruxa. The witcher promptly defeated the vampiress, who was not the Beast itself but was clearly in league with it. Yet Geralt could not guess at the link between them nor at the identity of the creature that had inspired the bruxa's rampage through the vineyard. The witcher needed information on the Beast's previous victims. He supposed the duchess might have this and thus set off to find her.<br>
   1189434|00000000||Anna Henrietta's time was precious. To get an audience with her was never an easy feat. Even more so in those days, as the duchess was overseeing a chivalric tourney playing out on tourney grounds outside the walls of Toussaint's capital. Yet in the end Geralt faced the one who had summoned him. As they related what each had learned about the Beast, thus pooling their knowledge and hypotheses, they deduced the likely identity of its next victim, who could very well prove to be Milton de Peyrac-Peyran.<br>
   1189435|00000000||Geralt and Anna Henrietta rushed like rabbits through the palace gardens. Ironically, at the time the gardens were the venue for a game of Hunt the Hare. Milton had been assigned the title role. The knight, having donned a bunny rabbit costume, sat hiding in the gardens, waiting to be found by the game's participants based on clues they could win by completing various challenges. Yet the duchess and the witcher could spare no time for such nonsense and set out to win the clues by breaking the rules.<br>
   1189436|00000000||Having assembled the clues, Geralt and Anna Henrietta had concluded that Milton was hiding in a greenhouse. They had set off to find him post haste. Alas, they were too late. Amidst lush vegetation, they found Milton's rapidly cooling corpse. The murderer stood over it. As the witcher stepped towards him, the killer dashed off. Thus ended the first stage of Geralt's investigation. And thus began his mad pursuit of the murderer.<br>
   1203459|00000000||No sooner had Geralt arrived in Toussaint than he got his first taste of the local color. As he was clip-clopping along the high road, chit-chatting with Milton and Palmerin, a most unusual sight unfolded before his eyes. Here was a knight, with all the expected accoutrements, charging headlong at a windmill! The situation became clear a moment later when a giant strode from behind the windmill and charged right back at the knight. Before anyone could say "Only in Toussaint," the witcher and all three knights were swinging away at the brute, amidst the freshly crumbled ruins of the mill and a herd of panic-stricken sheep.<br>
   1212311|00000000||Geralt and the duchess divided in hopes of conquering their task more quickly. Geralt went to retrieve the golden fish. Once he finally succeeded in doing so, he found a small key hidden within it. He pondered this a short while and came to the conclusion the palace gardens contained but few structures that could require the use of a key to enter. Our clever hero thus abandoned his initial plan, and instead of meeting with the duchess, rushed off to find a locked door. In this way, he found himself at the greenhouse in which the Hare he sought was indeed hidden.<br><br>Alas, he was too late. Amidst lush vegetation, he found Milton's rapidly cooling corpse. The murderer stood over it. As the witcher stepped towards him, the killer dashed off. Thus ended the first stage of Geralt's investigation. And thus began his mad pursuit of the murderer.<br>

   1198298|00000000||Greetings! I hope your search goes well.
   1205253|00000000||I'll be honest - already found the others.
   1205255|00000000||Without any hints as to their whereabouts? That's incredible!
   1205522|00000000||Any idea how to find the others?
   1205524|00000000||Of course, I just need a partner who will help me retrieve them. For a fitting reward, of course.
   1205246|00000000||Just so happens that's why I'm here. Look what I found.
   1205248|00000000||This is quite the coincidence! It's exactly one of the diagrams I meant!
   1197893|00000000||Heard of 'em. Never seen any, though. Thought they were lost…
   1197895|00000000||Not quite! For I've been lucky enough to learn that their holders came to Toussaint. Alas, they then perished, but I know where! I just need a partner to help me retrieve them.
   1207113|00000000||If you know where to look, why not get 'em yourself?
   1207115|00000000||No offense, but do I look like a rough-hewn adventurer…? Besides, who would serve my clients while I romped about seeking them?
   1207117|00000000||No… I rather leave it to someone familiar with such matters. Bring me the diagrams, and from them I'll forge for you whatever you fancy.
   1189573|00000000||Greetings.
   1196166|00000000||A witcher! From the School of the Wolf! Here in Toussaint! Greetings! I'm Lazare Lafargue!
   1197889|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. Seem pretty enthused. Got a job for me?
   1197891|00000000||Rather! Mind you, it's no monster hunt, but I'm sure you'll be interested all the same. I'm an armorer, see, and I've for years sought diagrams for witcher armor of exceptional quality, grandmaster level.
   1196185|00000000||You're back! So, how shall it be? Will you help hunt down the grandmaster diagrams? Those for witcher armor?
   1205260|00000000||Managed to find five sets in all.
   1205545|00000000||Incredible! Simply absurd! Five sets?! I beg you, do tell me what you've learned.
   1205547|00000000||Scraps, for the most part, but fine - tell me what you know. I'll fill in any blanks I can.
   1205258|00000000||Found five sets of diagrams.
   1205535|00000000||We must strike a deal. I shall tell you all I know of the remaining diagrams. In return, once you've found them, you will let me draft a copy.
   1205533|00000000||We must strike a deal. I shall tell you all I know. In return, once you've found the diagrams, you will let me draft a copy.
   1196179|00000000||All these diagrams somehow wound up in Toussaint. How was that even possible?
   1196181|00000000||Toussaint was once home to Tyen'sail, a legendary and now deceased elven master armorer. Witchers from all corners of the world came to him to forge their plate, their mail.
   1196183|00000000||Heard about him - supposed to have been the best.
   1197897|00000000||And thus he charged a king's ransom for his work. Witchers would take difficult, dangerous work to earn the coin to pay him. Some, alas, met with misfortune, and the diagrams they carried were left to rot with their earthly remains.
   1206279|00000000||Got it - find them, find the diagrams. But how can I know where to look for their remains?
   1197899|00000000||As it happens, I learned my trade at Tyen'sail's side. So I heard the stories of the missing witchers first-hand.
   1197901|00000000||What he told me… well, that is what discouraged me from seeking the diagrams out myself.
   1196177|00000000||How'd these diagrams wind up in Toussaint?
   1205539|00000000||Managed to find something already.
   1205541|00000000||Wonderful! I shall draft a copy. This is good, this at last will earn me the title of grandmaster!
   1207119|00000000||I thank you, witcher!
   1205368|00000000||Found something already.
   1199013|00000000||This elven master, how'd he end up taking a human for an apprentice?
   1199015|00000000||My father forged armor. As a youngster I helped him, then began forging my own pieces. Master Tyen'sail saw my work and offered to take me on as his apprentice.
   1199019|00000000||Only now, years on, do I realize the honor that was.
   1199021|00000000||Alas, my master perished in a massacre later, slain by racists. Though he taught me everything he knew, I did not manage to complete the guild's requirements for grandmaster while he lived.
   1205993|00000000||I know I have no equal in the trade. Yet until I complete witcher armor of grandmaster quality, I shall never be certain I've become my teacher's equal.
   1199011|00000000||How'd you end up apprenticed to an elf?
   1214641|00000000||What do you have on offer?
   1214638|00000000||Lemme see what you got.
   1197913|00000000||Would you craft something for me?
   1197915|00000000||Of course.
   1178038|00000000||Like you to craft something for me, would you?
   1197909|00000000||Farewell.
   1197911|00000000||Good luck on the Path!
   1178039|00000000||Farewell.
   1196132|00000000||The diagrams - tell me where to look for them.
   1202328|00000000||These diagrams - where do I look for them? Let's talk about the other witchers.
   1202330|00000000||Of course. Where should I begin?
   1197905|00000000||Where do I look for these diagrams?
   1200803|00000000||I know of five likely fallen witchers, each from a different school - of the Wolf, Griffin, Cat, Bear and Manticore. Which should I start with?
   1196228|00000000||Tell me about the Wolf.
   1196090|00000000||Tell me about my brother, the Wolf.
   1206360|00000000||His name was Adon. I remember him well. My master liked him, helped him find a safe yet well-paid contract.
   1196100|00000000||A few years ago, an archaeological expedition arrived in Toussaint from Castel Graupian. They questioned my master about the elven ruins at Termes. He warned them of the danger there and recommended they take Adon as an escort.
   1198768|00000000||What kind of danger did he mean? Any idea?
   1200799|00000000||Legend claims wraiths haunt the chambers beneath Termes. I cannot say if there is any truth to this, but both the scholars and the witcher disappeared without a trace.
   1205297|00000000||Guess I got lucky. Managed to find all the diagrams.
   1205272|00000000||I'll probably learn what happened by the time I find the rest of the diagrams.
   1196229|00000000||Tell me about the Griffin.
   1196092|00000000||The Griffin - what can you tell me about him?
   1196104|00000000||He came some two hundred years ago, but my master remembered him well. This witcher was not stripped of emotions, you see, as his colleagues were. He had taken on a contract at Fort Ussar and required better gear.
   1196106|00000000||He showed my master his diagrams, paid a deposit - and was never seen again. Apparently he rode off one night from the fort, never to return.
   1206381|00000000||Any idea where he went?
   1200843|00000000||No, it's said he left in a rush, so he may have left something behind. Only ruins remain of Fort Ussar, but you may wish to search them.
   1205292|00000000||At heart, a sad story, that. Tragic, even.
   1205299|00000000||Interesting story. Fits right in with what I learned on my own. Found all the School of the Griffin diagrams, in any case.
   1205274|00000000||Started looking for those diagrams, but don't have them all yet.
   1196230|00000000||Tell me about the Cat.
   1196094|00000000||Let's talk about the Cat.
   1196108|00000000||A year ago, Bartolomé de Launay, the ducal armorer, asked me to confirm the authenticity of a witcher diagram he had received by messenger.
   1196110|00000000||You see, at the time he was working on new armor for the Ducal Guard. A witcher from the School of the Cat offered to sell him diagrams for a full set of gear. The diagrams would have been helpful indeed.
   1206609|00000000||The diagram you saw, was it really a witcher diagram?
   1198772|00000000||Beyond any doubt. It's a shame de Launay didn't let me draft a copy. He was quite shaken up, afraid the witcher might simply kill him and take his coin.
   1200845|00000000||Possibly a well-founded fear. Soon after, de Launay disappeared without a trace. I would have searched his former home for clues, but it has fallen into disrepair and it is simply too dangerous there.
   1205301|00000000||Found all the School of the Cat diagrams already.
   1205276|00000000||Found something. Not enough for a full set of gear, though.
   1196231|00000000||Tell me about the Bear.
   1196096|00000000||Tell me more about the Bear, can you?
   1196112|00000000||He appeared shortly after master Tyen'sail took me on as his apprentice. I remember the bear head medallion that hung from his neck, I remember a towering witcher who haggled like a fishwife.
   1206622|00000000||Witchers never have too much coin.
   1196114|00000000||True, this one clearly was not wealthy. But he pledged to bring us coin after he completed a contract at the Tufo Vineyard, where a building had just collapsed.
   1198774|00000000||Time passed, the Bear never showed, and my master sent me to the Tufo estate. As it turned out the witcher had indeed accepted a job. Yet that was all they heard of him, and that is all I know.
   1205303|00000000||Seems I found the full set of School of the Bear diagrams.
   1205278|00000000||Interesting. Don't think I've found the complete set of School of the Bear diagrams, but I'll keep looking.
   1196232|00000000||Tell me about the Manticore.
   1196098|00000000||School of the Manticore - probably know the least about it. Though once, long ago, wore some armor forged there.
   1196116|00000000||My master said the Manticores have their fortress in the far east. A century past one of their number came to him, a witcher named Merten.
   1196118|00000000||He made a poor impression on my master. He stank like a dwarven still and quarreled fiercely, all the time.
   1198776|00000000||Tyen'sail slammed the door in his face and told him to return when he sobered up. He would conduct no business with a drunk.
   1200859|00000000||The witcher, however, failed to return. Folk say he got into a booze-fueled brawl with the Ducal Guard. He was arrested and sentenced.
   1200861|00000000||Bastoy Prison, where he was held, well, it's been a ruin for years. Still, you may want to start your search there?
   1205305|00000000||Took quite the effort, but it was worth it. Got all the School of the Manticore diagrams.
   1205280|00000000||School of the Manticore gear's really rare. All the more reason to search for the remaining diagrams.
   1205262|00000000||I do not know how to thank you.
   1206624|00000000||At last, I stand a chance of producing something exceptional, a chance of proving I am no worse than my master. Your reward, witcher - and I await your order.
   1196256|00000000||Changing the subject…
   1198766|00000000||Like to ask you about something else.
   1205514|00000000||Hey, Lafargue.
   1205516|00000000||Ah, good to see you!
   1202123|00000000||A witcher in Beauclair…? That's queer….
   1202125|00000000||Wonder what brings him here…?
   1202129|00000000||You'll regret that. Regret yer whole fuckin' life.
   1202131|00000000||Fuck!
   1202127|00000000||Careful, when I fuck ye, ye'll know it!
    171105|ba136f47||Wild Dog
   1186612|00000000||Folk say there's a witch in these parts.
   1195921|00000000||Do they say what sort of devilry she works?
   1195923|00000000||The sort that can turn a lass into a tree.
   1195925|00000000||Ah… Maybe I'll seek her out. I caught my man staring after a barmaid the other day. If the witch can turn that milky skin to bark, that'll put an end to his ogling.
   1126392|00000000||So? Any thoughts on Vivienne?
   1130702|00000000||Her beauty's striking.
   1130704|00000000||That is not what I ask.
   1130706|00000000||Still too early to say anything I'd be willing to stand behind.
   1189890|00000000||Managed to figure one thing out - she uses powerful magic, masking illusions.
   1189900|00000000||Do you mean to say she might in truth look different than she seems?
   1189918|00000000||Only guessing right now.
   1189881|00000000||Found some clues… Got me wondering if your beloved Vivienne's not a bruxa.
   1189883|00000000||A bruxa?! You mean a… a vampiress?!
   1189912|00000000||Not sure yet.
   1126403|00000000||We've still some time before Vivienne arrives. Let us drink.
   1126419|00000000||Some other time. I'm busy.
   1126432|00000000||Got business to finish here. We'll duel another day.
   1160045|00000000||You cannot refuse another mans' challenge. It is dishonorable - you would be excluded from the tourney! Then what will become of Vivienne?
   1160055|00000000||Coward!
   1160057|00000000||Fine. Main arena, see you there.
   1126430|00000000||Since you insist, I'm all yours.
   1131943|00000000||You shall bitterly regret deserting my mother's army once I'm done with you!
   1126418|00000000||Fine, more than willing to fight.
   1126417|00000000||Your presence at this tourney is an affront to my honor!
   1131924|00000000||I demand satisfaction!
   1131926|00000000||Head to the nearest brothel, then.
   1131928|00000000||Coward! Mounted combat in the main arena - I challenge you!
   1126423|00000000||Dropped something.
   1131917|00000000||I demand satisfaction! You've insulted me twicely!
   1126425|00000000||And twicely oughta be enough.
   1126427|00000000||You refuse to duel?! Then I shall show you how I treat cowards!
   1126409|00000000||Sorry. Don't drink while I work.
   1126405|00000000||Thanks, some other time.
   1126404|00000000||Why not.
   1126407|00000000||To Vivienne! May you find the means to aid her.
   1157555|00000000||To Vivienne.
   1173417|00000000||Ahh… When I first laid eyes on her, I finally understood what all those poems and ballads were trying to say.
   1173419|00000000||Love's not poetry alone. Sometimes it's prose. And sometimes it's just plain ugly.
   1173421|00000000||You say that only because you do not know Vivienne as I do. A life with her would be sweetness itself!
   1188579|00000000||Actually, you don't know her all that well, either.
   1152257|00000000||Only once in his life had Geralt ever seen armor made from diagrams hailing from the School of the Manticore. What's more, said suit had been incomplete and, truth be told, the worse for wear. So when the opportunity arose to assemble Manticore gear, and at a grandmaster level to boot, the witcher did not hesitate a moment before setting off in search of what was required.<br>
   1152258|00000000||I venture to say none would have expected these diagrams' owner, the witcher Merten, to convert honestly and truly to the creed embodied in the Prophet Lebioda. Geralt retraced Merten's story and stopped to think how perverse fate could sometimes prove. But he considered the matter but a brief moment, for he had in hand a complete set of diagrams needed to craft gear of the School of the Manticore, and he could now take the drawings to the right craftsman.<br>
   1189166|00000000||Go to the ruins of Bastoy Prison.
   1189179|00000000||Go to the cave where Lebioda once stayed.
   1189180|00000000||Find the place Merten traveled to.
   1189182|00000000||Go to Lebioda's temple.
   1189183|00000000||Search for tracks left by Merten.
   1189178|00000000||Go to the cave with the hidden chapel.
   1189186|00000000||Search the hidden chapel.

   1162793|00000000||Please, sir, succor a man who has ceased to be one.
   1162797|00000000||Help me, please!
   1162799|00000000||A few coppers for bread, please, sir!
   1190878|00000000||You daft?
   1190880|00000000||Damn!
   1190882|00000000||Bloody hell!
   1190884|00000000||Ooh, I'm about to get really mad.
   1190888|00000000||At your service.
   1190890|00000000||Ah, welcome.
   1190886|00000000||Something's brewing, right?
   1205772|00000000||One of your ilk, a witcher, ought to manage with an old goat, eh?
   1205776|00000000||This, this, my favorite part of the test…
   1205774|00000000||This is the last test. You must show what you're made of!
   1176339|00000000||<i>One can be forgiven for thinking garkains harbor some kind of particular hatred for humans. After all, given what humans are like, it would be hard to blame them.</i><br>– Agnes of Myrkvid, druid flaminica and scholar.<br>
   1176340|00000000||When a vampire gives a witcher a contract to kill another vampire, you can be certain neither of the two is entirely normal.<br><br>The contract seemed simple enough, though Geralt knew his target was a vampire. Yet one must bear in mind vampires are a very diverse group and their various species differ from one another greatly.<br><br>The witcher established the individual he sought had long, hooked claws with which it could tear apart a body with ease, leaving behind venom which hindered the clotting of blood. What’s more, it could use these claws to scale even the sheer outer wall of a building, giving others the impression it possessed mind-boggling powers. Geralt also realized his opponent was an experienced predator able to set ambushes for its prey and attack it unexpectedly.<br>
   1176342|00000000||The monster he was tracking turned out to be a powerful type of garkain, a pack leader or alpha.<br><br>As the witcher expected, in addition to its ability to emit waves of mental energy, this alpha garkain also had powerful venom at its disposal.<br><br>The monster killed for pleasure, not just to satisfy its hunger. It must be admitted that Geralt also gained a measure of satisfaction from eradicating this beast, for he could still remember the massacre in the orphanage for which this garkain was responsible.
   1176338|00000000||Alpha Garkains
   1207693|00000000||Away, beast!
   1207695|00000000||We'll be slaughtered!
   1207697|00000000||Arrgh!
   1188763|00000000||Blind, are you?!
   1198745|00000000||Oooooh, weeeeeell, I don't know.
   1198743|00000000||Sweet saintly Lebioda! I can't believe it!
   1198909|00000000||Foes yesterday, partners today, and tomorrow? Lovebirds tomorrow! Long live Matilda and master Liam!
   1200571|00000000||May all those wenches at Coronata birth their babes the bumway!
   1188769|00000000||Hold on, hold on… was it not you who freed the town from the blood gulpers?
   1188771|00000000||To this day, I still cannot believe it… Blood garglers! At Beauclair's throat!
   1188767|00000000||If they would just take to work as they take to dance and drink…
   1188765|00000000||I've scissored my fingers near to shreds…
   1188773|00000000||What… what… what are you doing?
   1198751|00000000||With the duquessa dead, that Nilfgaardian emperor's our liege! They say he aims to move into the palace!
   1198749|00000000||Folk claim there're such a racket in the cemetery at night that no one gets a wink of sleep. Nor do they know what's making all the noise!
   1198747|00000000||They say the witcher's a mate of the famed bard Dandelion. And that minstrel and our duchess once… you know! Wink, wink!
   1188761|00000000||I don't get paid to chit-chat!
   1188759|00000000||Greetings.
   1202320|00000000||Hael Geralt aep Rivia!
   1202322|00000000||Bloede hanses… It's good you drove them off, witcher!
   1192731|00000000||Preparations for the coronation coming along?
   1192733|00000000||Not at all. I told him I'm in no hurry. I must see what the whole thing's about, first, acquaint myself with the empire's institutions, laws, and so forth.
   1192735|00000000||No pressure from Emhyr to speed things along?
   1192737|00000000||He tried, but I told him I wished to be a good ruler, a strong ruler, not some puppet.
   1192739|00000000||No one else in the world he'd give in to like that.
   1192741|00000000||I had nothing to do with that. There's just no one else in the world who's his daughter.
   1193648|00000000||Speaking o which, as the future empress, I could secure you a comfortable position as court witcher…
   1193650|00000000||Thanks, but.. just not my thing, that. My place is on the Path.
   1193652|00000000||Hehe. I know. Still had to try.
   1192621|00000000||When's the coronation?
   1192622|00000000||You're a witcher - how's it feel?
   1192626|00000000||Being a witcher anything like you imagined?
   1192628|00000000||Geralt, I didn't have to imagine anything… Remember, before we parted we walked a good stretch of the Path together…
   1192630|00000000||Journeyman and master, though, not the same thing.
   1192632|00000000||I'm still a long way from mastering anything. But I am trying. Anyway, I did learn from the best.
   1192634|00000000||Just passed on what worked for me. Or at least tried to.
   1193683|00000000||I was thinking of Eskel and Lambert… Mhmhmhmhmhm….
   1193687|00000000||So, no regrets? Choice you made?
   1192636|00000000||Not at all. I'm doing what I ever wanted to do, being who I wanted to be. I believe that's one definition of happiness.
   1192623|00000000||Run into any hate yet?
   1192638|00000000||Encountered the most charming aspect of being a witcher yet?
   1192640|00000000||Which aspect is that?
   1192642|00000000||The hatred, disgust. That strange blend of admiration, fear and contempt.
   1192644|00000000||Hm. They set their hounds on me in one village. In another, they forbade me from taking a drink from their well. Other than that, it's been all right. No one's tried to cheat me out of my reward so far.
   1192650|00000000||I'd hoped they'd treat a woman differently.
   1192652|00000000||Geralt… When they treat a woman differently in this world it hardly ever means better. Quite the opposite.
   1195959|00000000||Contract in Angren - tell me.
   1196003|00000000||Angren - how'd it go? Garkains can be pretty tough opponents…
   1196017|00000000||That's why I had to lure this one to a place both spacious and empty, where it would have nowhere to hide. I found an abandoned crypt far from any town or village.
   1196045|00000000||Good choice. Always best to avoid additional casualties. So your foe had nowhere to hide, but the bastard was still damn quick, I bet.
   1196047|00000000||Not as quick as I am. My greater worry was its strength, I was far out-classed there. But a dose of Black Blood did the trick. We fought a while, I feigned a mistimed dodge and let it drink. The rest was easy.
   1202078|00000000||See you've taken a liking to this place…
   1202080|00000000||Ehh, I could stay right here forever.
   1195937|00000000||*Sniff* What's that smell?
   1201995|00000000||You look good.
   1201997|00000000||Come, don't just stand there. I want a hug.
   1201999|00000000||What'd you bring…?
   1202001|00000000||A garkain from Angren. I slew it. All by my lonesome.
   1202003|00000000||That why you left Carreras so suddenly… ? Had no idea where you'd gone. You note was… puzzling - "Don't try to find me." Threw me for a loop.
   1202005|00000000||That was silly. It's just that I felt… stifled, in your shadow, I'd have suffocated had I stayed.
   1202007|00000000||So when I read that notice, the contract… when I saw Angren, I knew I had to do it. Alone. Without my nanny.
   1202010|00000000||I'm not your nanny. I believe in you.
   1202013|00000000||Like my new house?
   1202029|00000000||You've fixed it up nicely.
   1202031|00000000||Thanks. Got the house from the duchess as a down payment for killing the beast. Come outside, I'll show you the grounds.
   1202033|00000000||It's a lovely home. Has a great deal of potential.
   1202035|00000000||Got it from the duchess as a down payment for killing the Beast. Already managed to renovate a bit… Come outside, I'll show you the grounds.
   1202025|00000000||The house is lovely… but it could use a bit of work.
   1202027|00000000||Yeah… got plans for it, don't worry. Wanna go outside? Could show you the grounds.
   1202037|00000000||Aahh, it's lovely here! I could stay forever…
   1202045|00000000||Nah, come on. You wouldn't like it…
   1202047|00000000||Why not?
   1202049|00000000||Get bored mighty quick. There's nothing here. It's peaceful, quiet, not a bloodthirsty beast in sight…
   1202052|00000000||After that garkain in Angren, I believe I deserve a little rest.
   1202039|00000000||Doubt you'd like it.
   1202038|00000000||So stay.
   1202061|00000000||What's stopping you?
   1202043|00000000||Actually… not a thing! I slew a garkain, collected my bounty. I believe I'm owed some respite.
   1202070|00000000||Indeed you do, mademoiselle, as my majordomo would say.
   1202072|00000000||You've a butler?
   1202074|00000000||A steward. Name's Barnabas-Basil - B.B. for short, though I don't know if he likes it. He's the one let you in. I'll ask him to bring in some fruit, a beverage. You can spend the rest of the day lying about.
   1202076|00000000||Nothing would make me happier.
   1192782|00000000||See you later.
   1192811|00000000||See you later, Ciri.
   1192813|00000000||Take care of yourself.
   1192830|00000000||See you later.
   1192620|00000000||Where's the emperor? What's he doing?
   1192715|00000000||How fares your venerable father?
   1192721|00000000||He seems younger, quite rejuvenated. Abandoning high-level politics seems to have done it. It's as if the very awareness of peace grants him strength. Which most likely is the case.
   1192723|00000000||Think he'll keep his word?
   1192725|00000000||I think that depends on me. If he feels I'm up to the task, he'll head out to pasture, yes…
   1192727|00000000||And if he doesn't?
   1192729|00000000||Then there'll be nothing to stop him from returning. He hasn't ever had a problem changing his mind.
   1187613|00000000||You look good.
   1192030|00000000||Come, don't just stand there. I want a hug.
   1202016|00000000||Thought I'd… I'd never see you again.
   1202018|00000000||Well, I've departed, escaped, been forced to flee so many times… yet I always returned. You ought to be used ot it by now.
   1202020|00000000||I like coming back into your life.
   1202022|00000000||I'm just glad you're here.
   1192061|00000000||You've fixed the place up nicely.
   1192072|00000000||Thanks. Got the house from the duchess as a down payment for killing the Beast. Come outside, lemme show you the grounds.
   1192079|00000000||You've a lovely home. With a great deal of potential.
   1192081|00000000||Got it from the duchess as her down payment for killing the Beast. Even started to renovate a bit… Come outside, lemme show you the grounds.
   1192063|00000000||The house is lovely… It just needs some work.
   1192065|00000000||Yeah… plan to do a lot. Wanna go outside, maybe? Could show you the grounds.
   1192142|00000000||Aahh, it's lovely here! I could stay forever…
   1192200|00000000||Nah, come on. You wouldn't like it…
   1192202|00000000||Why not?
   1202056|00000000||Be bored to death. No orders to sign, no subjects to sentence to torture and death…
   1202058|00000000||I intend to do no such thing, ever. And I don't set my name to any orders just yet. I'm being groomed - Emhyr's idea. So he sent me and a flock of advisors off on a tour of the provinces.
   1192196|00000000||Doubt you'd like it.
   1192195|00000000||So stay.
   1192198|00000000||Anything stopping you?
   1202054|00000000||Obligations, duties. I'm only here because papa, I mean, Emhyr, concluded I must get to know what I'll rule once I take the throne. So I'm on a tour of the provinces with a small swarm of advisors.
   1192180|00000000||Which essentially means they take turns lecturing me while I follow them about, scribbling notes.
   1192186|00000000||Plan to stay in Beauclair a while?
   1192188|00000000||A bit. I convinced my advisors we'd be unwise to depart before I'd tasted each of this year's wines. My knowledge would be incomplete, you see.
   1202063|00000000||Though actually, just between you and me, I'm not certain I'm cut out to rule, govern, all that…
   1202065|00000000||Thinking you might give it up?
   1202067|00000000||I can't say just yet. But I'm not willing to rule it out.
   1194217|00000000||How are things, neighbor?
   1194219|00000000||Greetings.
   1194221|00000000||Hm?
   1194223|00000000||You in a hurry?
   1151184|00000000||Fecking fairy-flaps, what the demon happened there?!
   1151191|00000000||My fault. Went about lifting the curse the wrong way. More like tore than freed her from her prison. Shock was too much. Released all the rage and pain that was in her.
   1151193|00000000||Blimey, man. I suppose that's what I get for hiring a bungler.
   1154250|00000000||At least the lady's pain is done, she'll suffer no more in the tree. Now take your coin and go.
   1185738|00000000||Dammit… Witch freed the ghost from the tree, as promised.
   1185740|00000000||Failed to add the specter'd be insane, full of pain and rage.
   1187525|00000000||Possessed the first living creature it ran into - the dog. Dog then killed Jacob.
   1194594|00000000||Farewell, chivalrous woodsman. Sorry it ended this way.
   1194597|00000000||Life's rarely like a fairytale. Still, folk've gotta have faith, believe in something.
   1106311|00000000||One day, while traversing Toussaint's charming wilderness, Geralt ran into two men desperately calling for help. As they told it, their brother had remained in the cave they had just hastily left. Nothing out of the ordinary, I suppose, if not for the fact that inside this sibling had been attacked by beasts. Geralt decided he would try to help the man.<br>
   1148069|00000000||As Geralt and Hugo were leaving the none-too-hospitable caverns, Hugo's two siblings, assisted by a handful of armed men, blocked their way. Fearing for his life, Hugo begged the witcher to teach his treacherous bastard brothers a lesson. Yet as we all know, Geralt has a strong aversion for unnecessary violence, so he turned Hugo down. This proved a wise decision - forced to discuss their differences, the three brothers settled their dispute and resolved to embark on an enterprise together.<br>
   1158096|00000000||One day, while strolling through Beauclair's bustling streets, Geralt spotted a notice - someone was in need off an escort as they wished to penetrate a cave. The task seemed none too complicated or taxing, so the witcher concluded it would be unwise to let it pass.<br>
   1175526|00000000||Geralt followed a trail of blood to find Hugo. Wounded by monsters, the man had sought shelter in the cave's depths.<br>
   1175527|00000000||Hugo begged Geralt to find a condenser, part of a complicated contraption his father had devised. Papa had cast this part into an underground lake.<br>
   1194717|00000000||One day, while traversing Toussaint's charming wilderness, Geralt ran into two men desperately calling for help. As they told it, their brother had remained in the cave they had just hastily left. Nothing out of the ordinary, I suppose, if not for the fact that inside this sibling had been attacked by beasts.<br>
   1208032|00000000||Before speaking to the posters of the notice, Geralt set out to do a bit of reconnaissance. Yet he returned to them quickly to find out what the job was to entail. The brothers, trembling in fear, explained that their other brother, beset by monsters, was trapped in a nearby cave.<br>
   1208495|00000000||I must admit that this time Geralt truly made a mess of things. He started by arguing with Hugo's brothers, and, when the dispute escalated and tempers flared, he abandoned the whole lot to their enmity and itchy fists. I never learned how the story of Hugo Monnart and his brothers ended, and Geralt never received any payment for the troubles he had nonetheless endured.<br>
   1139000|00000000||As Geralt and Hugo headed for the exit out of the none-too-hospitable caverns, Hugo's two brothers and a handful of armed men blocked their way. Fearing for his life, Hugo begged the witcher to teach his treacherous bastard brothers a lesson. Deciding that he should see the matter through to the end, Geralt fulfilled Hugo's wish.<br>
   1094367|00000000||Find out what happened to the missing brother.
   1094368|00000000||Follow the trail.

   1193849|00000000||Yeees?
   1187621|00000000||You were to polish my sword.
   1196309|00000000||But… but I did! All night I spent rubbing it, sharpening it, oiling it…
   1196311|00000000||On the fuller a rust stain. On the point the prints of your greasy fingers!
   1196313|00000000||You will pay for this. After the tourney.

   1172739|00000000||Shaves, trims, bowl cuts - I do it all! And cheap!
   1172741|00000000||I'll cut you, shave you, scratch you behind your ears!

   1195107|00000000||It felt itself to be not yours, but mine.

   1153755|00000000||Welcome, my good sir.
   1184210|00000000||Welcome, Sir Ravix. I've heard tell of your accomplishments.
   1153769|00000000||Changed my mind.
   1153759|00000000||Beard's gotten scraggy.
   1153771|00000000||Keep it fluffy.
   1153772|00000000||Want a nice, neat goatee.
   1153773|00000000||Sideburns and mustache - that'll look good.
   1153774|00000000||Mustache and a little duck tail on my chin - that's what I want.
   1153770|00000000||Need a clean shave.
   1153775|00000000||Changed my mind.
   1153762|00000000||My time's up. So long.
   1153760|00000000||Farewell.
   1153758|00000000||Hair's unkempt.
   1153763|00000000||Loosely gathered, tied behind the head.
   1153765|00000000||Long and loose.
   1153766|00000000||Loose, not too long.
   1153767|00000000||Shaved on the sides, short on top, and a ponytail.
   1153768|00000000||Elven rebel cut.
   1153764|00000000||Shaved head and ponytail.
   1205797|00000000||Need a bit of grooming.
   1184208|00000000||Welcome, Sir Geralt. I've heard tell of your accomplishments.
   1163926|857c2496||Milton de Peyrac-Peyran
   1175142|00000000||We've not got no need for yer help…
   1175144|00000000||Have no fear, good man. Our labors shall be done quickly, the prowlers to be banished for good.
   1175146|00000000||Milton! Look!
   1175148|00000000||Geralt!
   1209267|00000000||In the flesh.
   1178497|00000000||Hail, witcher! Let us go inside and greet you as befits an old friend.
   1178507|00000000||And you - fear not. We shall put an end to the rule of outlaws. Soon.
   1181711|00000000||Geralt! We had scoured all the land for you!
   1181713|00000000||Come inside, we must chat.
   1200231|00000000||Not sure who I expected, but sure didn't expect knights-errant.
   1176438|00000000||So, plan to go out and meet the bandits when they arrive? Fight them?
   1176599|00000000||Palmerin wishes first to appeal to their sense of decency, haha. But I expect they will be deaf to this.
   1178515|00000000||Yeah. Completely.
   1176440|00000000||We must afford them a chance to stand down. Many a hardened outlaw has left the path of wrongdoing upon hearing words of admonition.
   1176601|00000000||Doesn't happen in these lands. Ever.
   1179945|00000000||If they do not heed my reprimand, we at least will know we have done all within our means to evade bloodshed.
   1179947|00000000||Fine. Naturally, I'll help when Palmerin's rhetoric falls on deaf ears.
   1179949|00000000||Excellent! Then we've but to wait for the rogues to arrive!
   1176435|00000000||Lemme help you with the bandits.
   1180306|00000000||So, fess up, what brings you such a long way?
   1159341|00000000||We are to deliver Her Grace the Duchess' message in full, with all due ceremony. For tradition--
   1159343|00000000||Is sacred in Toussaint. All right. Fine.
   1159349|00000000||Most Honorable Geralt, Slayer of Monsters and All Evils Nefarious which Prey on the Defenseless of this World!
   1159440|00000000||Whereas never have you been known to deny help to the innocent nor leave widows and orphans to fates undeserved, answer you now our present summons!
   1159442|00000000||Free us from the Beast which floods our streets with blood and sows panic in the hearts of rich and poor alike!
   1159463|00000000||Come to our aid, witcher - thus humbly beseeches you the star-crossed city's most gracious protectress, Her Illustrious Highness, Duchess Anna Henrietta.
   1180308|00000000||Shall you answer her call?
   1161186|00000000||Still waiting?
   1192604|00000000||As I told you - we cannot return empty-handed. It is simply out of the question.
   1192606|00000000||Have you reconsidered? Will you take the offer?
   1192467|00000000||This contract - need to think about it.
   1192469|00000000||Toussaint's a long way off. Gotta think if I really want to make the trek.
   1192471|00000000||A minor inconvenience. We had hoped you would agree.
   1192473|00000000||Geralt, we've no cause to return without you. Should we do so, Her Grace will greet us with gallows. Do you wish to burden your soul with the deaths of two old friends? Return to us soon and accept.
   1192475|00000000||We will await you here. As Milton says, we've no choice.
   1159492|00000000||Something I need to see to first.
   1159514|00000000||We shall await you here.
   1159488|00000000||Need to take care of something.
   1159487|00000000||Let's got to Toussaint.
   1159490|00000000||Ready to go, soon as you're packed.
   1181940|00000000||Hah! Then posthaste to Toussaint!
   1183340|00000000||To Toussaint!
   1181482|00000000||Ehh, I sometimes think back to all the contracts I've ever taken from sovereigns. Can't name hardly any where I came out ahead.
   1181942|00000000||You cannot be thinking to refuse?!
   1181944|00000000||Ahh, no, just struck by a thought - how the duchess can sometimes be, hm… demanding.
   1181946|00000000||So you accept the contract! Excellent!
   1181948|00000000||We must set off at once. We long wandered this land, searching for you. Yet time is of the essence!
   1181938|00000000||I'll take the contract.
   1181502|00000000||Beast wields black magic? What makes you say so?
   1181504|00000000||The first victim vanished between bites at a feast. Of the feastgoers, none noticed this. They saw but an open window, then heard desperate cries from the street below, where a corpse had just been found.
   1192459|00000000||The second killing, similar. A knight in a locked room, servants all about the house, guards all around the estate. Yet the Beast somehow got him out, dragged him to the town square and killed him there. No one saw nor heard a thing.
   1181506|00000000||We have no fear of creatures against which sword and shield protect. But of this Beast nothing is known. Save that it cannot be traced, kills effortlessly and with no rhyme or reason we can discern.
   1181470|00000000||Beast wields black magic?
   1183331|00000000||Anyone tried to hunt it? Knights-errant, for example?
   1183333|00000000||Hah, many have tried - baiting, waiting in ambush, but to no avail.
   1183335|00000000||The Beast is clever - it evades all traps, and attacks of a sudden. It is like a ghost.
   1183337|00000000||An experienced tracker, this is what we need. With knowledge of monsters. In short, we need you.
   1183338|00000000||Anyone tried trapping the monster?
   1181469|00000000||Did you say tourney?
   1181472|00000000||Mentioned a tourney. Why doesn't the duchess just call it off?
   1181474|00000000||Simply, it is too late. The guests have arrived. The best knights of all lands, relatives of the emperor.
   1181476|00000000||The Beast could be a threat to others, not just to Her Grace's subjects.
   1181478|00000000||Got it. Foreign aristocrat dies, at best it's a scandal, at worst - a diplomatic incident.
   1180371|00000000||Might be the most fervent request that I take a contract ever. And the most polite.
   1180373|00000000||And now we've got all that behind us, I wanna hear more about this Beast. Some kind of monster? Just guessing.
   1183322|00000000||Most assuredly, though no one has caught a good look at it as yet. Our only sure witnesses - bodies massacred in a brutal, horrid manner.
   1180375|00000000||Look. Some sketches drafted from descriptions given by those who claim they glimpsed the Beast - each quite different. To my mind, these "witnesses" lie.
   1180377|00000000||How many victims so far?
   1181466|00000000||Two. When Her Grace learned of the second, she discharged us immediately to fetch you, promising grants of land and fortunes in gold should you answer her summons.
   1181468|00000000||An ill wind blows, Geralt. The Beast cannot be tracked - folk say it wields black magic. Also, both victims were nobly born, and the start of a tourney draws near.
   1159351|00000000||This Beast - tell me more.
   1159350|00000000||Anna Henrietta say all that? Word for word?
   1159354|00000000||Anna Henrietta really say all that? Word for word?
   1159373|00000000||Well, in point of fact she said, "Bring me the witcher and dare not spare your horses. Only make certain this time he comes alone."
   1159375|00000000||The ducal chamberlain added the rest. You know how it is.
   1159377|00000000||Yeah, I remember.
   1181937|00000000||I might add, be it unofficially, that a hefty reward awaits. Yet the specifics you will need to verify with Her Illustrious Highness.
   1189576|00000000||I'm all ears.
   1189577|00000000||Chin up, Palmerin.
   1189579|00000000||Peasants'll be fine, Palmerin. Been dealing with bandits for generations.
   1189581|00000000||Your words do little to assuage my sense of morality bruised.
   1176605|00000000||No point fighting bandits. Kill these, and others just as bad or possibly worse'll come in to fill the void.
   1176607|00000000||To cast a blind eye upon evil - there is no honor in it!
   1176609|00000000||Can't stay here to protect these folk from the dangers that come their way daily. Saw what I saw, heard them urge you to leave these raiders alone. Must have good reason to do that.
   1176611|00000000||Do you suggest that should we help, we assume responsibility for their fate, for their lives? This burden we cannot agree to bear.
   1176613|00000000||Geralt speaks wisely. We know neither this land, nor its peoples, nor its customs. And we have come with another duty altogether.
   1180005|00000000||Ehh, how I long to return to Toussaint - where all is simpler.
   1180007|00000000||Soon, my friend, soon. First, let us convey our missive to Geralt in the manner tradition ordains.
   1176436|00000000||Get rid of these bandits, worse ones'll come in to replace 'em.
   1175150|00000000||You see, Palmerin? I told you. The griffin at White Orchard - I knew that were we only to follow the tracks of its slayer, we would, in the end, find Geralt.
   1175152|00000000||Milton de Peyrac-Peyran and Palmerin de Launfal. Good to see you both. Been years.
   1175154|00000000||Be assured, we share your joy.
   1175156|00000000||You must forgive us our, uh, surroundings. When we pledged to place the village under our protection, the village elder gave us this hut as our lodgings. He swore it is the best hut in the village.
   1178499|00000000||Get involved in some squabble?
   1178501|00000000||We discovered that in retreating, the Redanian garrison had left this land's tillers at the mercy of numerous plagues, the tyranny of bandits the most onerous among them.
   1178503|00000000||These plunderers shall soon descend on this village to collect tribute. Milton and I will dissuade them.
   1178505|00000000||We are both sworn to fight injustice and oppression wherever they rear their heads. The matter does not concern you, of course, but do us the kindness of waiting? Once we have dealt with these marauders, we have a matter we must present to you.
   1200229|00000000||Found your message on a notice board.
   1178495|00000000||Geralt of Rivia!
   1175107|00000000||Hah! Sit with us, witcher!
   1187820|00000000||So, fess up, what brings you such a long way? Notice mentioned some "Beast"?
   1187822|00000000||We are to deliver Her Grace the Duchess' message in full, with all due ceremony. For tradition--
   1187824|00000000||Is sacred in Toussaint. All right. Fine.
   1187827|00000000||Most Honorable Geralt, Slayer of Monsters and All Evils Nefarious which Prey on the Defenseless of this World!
   1187829|00000000||Whereas never have you been known to deny help to the innocent nor leave widows and orphans to fates undeserved, answer you now our present summons!
   1187831|00000000||Free us from the Beast which floods our streets with blood and sows panic in the hearts of rich and poor alike!
   1187833|00000000||Come to our aid, witcher - thus humbly beseeches you the star-crossed city's most gracious protectress, Her Illustrious Highness, Duchess Anna Henrietta.
   1187835|00000000||Shall you answer her call?
   1168865|00000000||Met a whole rogues' gallery, all interesting folk, in prison… Can't say I'm eager to ever see any of my cellmates again, though.
   1168943|00000000||Of all the places to wind up behind bars, Toussaint was a good choice. No other ruler I know would change their mind so quickly.
   1168945|00000000||Especially given it wasn't about just anyone, but the duchess' very own sister…
   1168996|00000000||Thought you preferred complex solutions.
   1168998|00000000||Always seemed to me you were a very complicated creature, by nature. Not one to resort to such simple methods like drinking your worries away.
   1181595|00000000||There exist worries for which there quite simply is no other medicine.
   1151062|00000000||All in all, best part of the whole ceremony? It was short.
   1151064|00000000||Perhaps for you, as you ducked out early. The others are probably just getting started. The drunkenness never ends in this quaint realm…
   1168987|00000000||Not so fond of Toussaint after all, are we?
   1168989|00000000||Ah, this place is like a strong wine, Geralt. Good in small sips.
   1168853|00000000||… all those deaths I failed to prevent. Feel pretty awful right about now… Can't help thinking I could've done more.
   1168875|00000000||Now Toussaint's left without a ruler. Or more accurately, chaos rules here. Hand in hand with despair. Duchess won over people's hearts. All Beauclair now weeps for her.
   1168877|00000000||A mass outburst of emotion? Well… it seems her subjects have adopted some of their recent ruler's traits.
   1168883|00000000||Why the sarcasm? Thought you liked Anna Henrietta.
   1168881|00000000||I did. And I do truly rue her passing.
   1186439|00000000||Me too.
   1186441|00000000||Then let us drink.
   1188512|00000000||Syanna was unbending.
   1188468|00000000||Whatever you say about Syanna - you gotta admit, she was unbending.
   1188470|00000000||That she was. I do admit it. Though in her case it would have been better if she had been a tad more philosophical, pausing from time to time to reflect on the propriety of her actions.
   1188485|00000000||True.
   1190920|00000000||Left some flowers on her grave.
   1168861|00000000||Beauclair seems safe now. Though I'm still left wondering - I mean, Dettlaff's alive. Think Anna Henrietta's still in danger?
   1168967|00000000||No. He had a score to settle with Syanna. By his reckoning he did just that.
   1181679|00000000||He has no reason to attack anyone else. Or to remain in Beauclair any longer.
   1211297|00000000||Sure hope so. Though in his boots, I'd regret having to go. Place is just plain beautiful, dammit.
   1188442|00000000||If you think it's a good idea, let's go. But I think you might be forgetting one thing. Fresh mandrake root of this variety's highly toxic, even to a witcher.
   1188444|00000000||Not a problem. I never forget matters of safety and hygiene in alchemy. Here, gloves and a mask. Don them and you shall be in no danger.
   1188440|00000000||Thanks. Right, then - let's go.
   1188431|00000000||Fine, let's go.
   1188432|00000000||Right now? In the dark?
   1188434|00000000||You decide to go root picking now? It's dark out.
   1188436|00000000||Ehh, Geralt… Even were I generously to assume it had simply slipped your mind that I am a vampire and thus need no light to see…
   1188438|00000000||… I'd never believe you had also forgotten that you, likewise, have absolutely no trouble seeing in the dark. So, shall we?
   1187858|00000000||How do you find my personal brew? Not too strong?
   1187899|00000000||Just right.
   1187901|00000000||Credit the local mandrake, of the Alrauna Diavolis variety, for that. The tubers which grow in this area's volcanic soil have an altogether unique flavor profile and display a remarkably uncommon dark-brown tint.
   1188428|00000000||Fascinating. All I can say is, this batch turned out excellent.
   1188430|00000000||Indeed. It might be wise to stockpile some roots for the future. Would you care to accompany me?
   1206134|00000000||Those bruxae…. they called you a traitor.
   1206136|00000000||Alas… We've a very simple code of honor, we vampires. So simple you might call it trivial. Either one is with us - unconditionally, regardless of the circumstances - or…
   1207133|00000000||Won't let it go, will they.
   1207135|00000000||They will not. Fortunately, we've another rule - an unwritten one, and just as trivial as the first. It is neatly summarized in the saying, "Out of sight, out of mind."
   1207137|00000000||That is why I must leave Toussaint. For a vastly long time, most like.
   1207139|00000000||Yeah, I get it.
   1207141|00000000||Ah… Let us make for my camp. I've an overwhelming desire to have another drink.
   1162016|00000000||Don't know yet.
   1162074|00000000||Ehh… don't really know yet. Might find the life of a hard-working vintner too tempting one day.
   1162076|00000000||Or maybe I'll just stick to the Path, go on roaming, staring up at the stars after laying my bedroll at the roadside.
   1162078|00000000||Ah, roadsides, bedrolls and the sky above. I sense some poetry coming on… which of course brings to mind Dandelion.
   1162015|00000000||No. I was made to kill monsters.
   1162059|00000000||No. Just not the life for me. Sure, might stop by there occasionally, stay the winter, fill up on wine…
   1162061|00000000||But I'd rather keep moving. It's not a choice, being a witcher. And once you are one, you're one for life. You can't just step off the Path.
   1191114|00000000||Besides, plenty of work left for me in the world. Ghouls aren't gonna kill themselves.
   1207151|00000000||Hey, managing a vineyard - wouldn't happen to be something you've always wanted to try, would it?
   1207153|00000000||Huh. I'm flattered, Geralt, I am. But no, I, too, was not made to saunter about in a robe and slippers.
   1207155|00000000||Rather droll, isn't it, that each time we meet something harrowing must happen.
   1162396|00000000||Ahh… I so don't feel like going anywhere. Sit here a while longer?
   1162398|00000000||So we shall, my friend. We have witnessed - and, in fact, on several occasions incited - many great and weighty events. After all that toil, I believe we deserve a bit of a rest.
   1189523|00000000||That we do.
   1162542|00000000||Let's sit a while longer.
   1207144|00000000||What about you? Any idea where you'll go?
   1162479|00000000||Distance is of the essence. I thought I might venture south.
   1162482|00000000||Nilfgaard?
   1162484|00000000||Why ever not? The Nilfgaardians are a modern society. None there believe in vampires anymore. This fact alone could be very useful to one wishing to remain incognito.
   1207149|00000000||Hmm. Interesting point of view.
   1207142|00000000||Where'll you go?
   1162541|00000000||What'll you do now?
   1207146|00000000||What about you, now? Got a plan?
   1151411|00000000||I do. I must find Dettlaff. Help him. I certainly owe him that much.
   1151413|00000000||Vampire friendships… Clear rules, must be nice.
   1162467|00000000||Do I detect a note of sarcasm?
   1162469|00000000||Not at all.
   1162119|00000000||I can remember a night, not too far from here, if I'm not mistaken. We hid in a cave while a blizzard raged all about. Does that sound at all familiar?
   1162121|00000000||How could it not? We'd just set off to rescue Ciri from Vilgefortz.
   1168992|00000000||Our encounter with Vilgefortz, that is something I do not remember so fondly. But that first stay in Beauclair, far calmer than this one.
   1189525|00000000||Seemed like a land straight out of a fairytale back then. Its sole problem - cellars too small to accommodate all that wine.
   1190712|00000000||Appearances, Geralt. Appearances, like mamunes and dopplers, deceive. So what did become of Vilgefortz?
   1198575|00000000||Killed him. Sure wasn't easy, though.
   1162029|00000000||Know what? Think I just might. Come on, now, don't laugh. Maybe not today, or tomorrow…
   1162057|00000000||But one day I'll wanna see what it's like - to just wake up everyday in my own bed.
   1162031|00000000||Oh, stop, please. Sounds so sentimental my fangs have begun to hurt. Then what? Will you begin writing your memoirs, like Dandelion?
   1162014|00000000||Yes. Think I'll settle down there for good.
   1190639|00000000||*Sniff sniff* Mmm, supreme bouquet. Firm, defined beginning, then develops gently, rising to a startling finish. Don't you think?
   1190702|00000000||Not much of a connoisseur.
   1162381|00000000||Then it is high time you started your education. After all, the Corvo Bianco Vineyard is now yours. By the way, I left a gift for you at your new home. On the nightstand.
   1209973|00000000||Hm. Thanks. Mind telling me what it is?
   1190657|00000000||A trifle. That will nonetheless be useful should you need mutagens.
   1209975|00000000||Incidentally, have you thought about what you'll do with your prize? Shall you hang your swords over the mantle and take to pruning vines?
   1188450|00000000||Know it's hard, a tender subject, but… wanted to thank you. For helping me with Dettlaff.
   1188452|00000000||You need not.
   1188456|00000000||Hate to pry, but why--
   1188458|00000000||Did I decide to stand against him? Ahh, I felt rage had consumed him completely. He'd crossed the line beyond which he could no longer control himself.
   1188460|00000000||He'd have remained the Beast, irrational, unfit to reason with, incapable of experiencing any of the emotions which, for simplicity's sake, we shall call human.
   1188462|00000000||I do not wish such a life upon anyone. And especially not on a friend.
   1188464|00000000||I understand.
   1188466|00000000||Forgive me, but I doubt you truly do. And it's very difficult to explain. Let's say I felt the solution I chose to be better for all involved… and for Dettlaff himself most of all.
   1188447|00000000||Thanks for helping with Dettlaff.
   1188448|00000000||Syanna was persistent, unbending.
   1168863|00000000||Syanna's dead, Dettlaff's gone, too. Beauclair's free of the Beast…
   1168969|00000000||… whichever of them it was.
   1181778|00000000||Beauclair's safe now.
   1181722|00000000||Thought you preferred complex solutions.
   1181724|00000000||Always seemed a very complex creature to me. By your very nature. Not one to go in for simple methods like drinking your worries away.
   1181726|00000000||I fear there are worries for which, quite simply, there is no other medicine.
   1182597|00000000||As you know, I had little sympathy for Syanna. Nonetheless I very much regret I could not keep her safe. To you, her ultimate fate - does it still bring on the occasional pang of regret?
   1182604|00000000||Yep. Still.
   1182606|00000000||Well then - drink up.
   1182316|00000000||As to Her Enlightened Highness, didn't go great. Got the full kaleidoscope of her emotional states, spun through it at an impressive pace, too.
   1182593|00000000||Am I to understand she didn't throw her arms about you and shower you with thanks for saving her from her murderous sister?
   1182595|00000000||Got that right. I don't blame her, though. Luckily, Dandelion was there to smooth things over. Somewhat.

   1189000|00000000||Merten went to the lakeside to seek final atonement. Should look into it.
   1189295|00000000||Just like the Great Beggar described it - chapel Merten visited must be in the cave.
   1205724|00000000||Dammit… What's going on here?
   1205726|00000000||Bruxae might've been hallucinations. Sure as hell fought as if they were real.
   1205728|00000000||Beggars? Here? Must be a test…
   1205732|00000000||Last one. Wonder what'll happen now…
   1205734|00000000||Man looks a lot like Lebioda. Impossible.
   1205736|00000000||Man being swarmed by kikimores… Wonder if he's real or just an illusion.
   1205740|00000000||Nude women? In a cave? Something's not right…
   1205763|00000000||Not seeing visions anymore. Hope that's the end of that.
   1205730|00000000||Sorry, fresh out of coin.
   1200841|00000000||Hmm… wonder if it's a relic of some sort.
   1191197|00000000||Splendid…
   1191218|00000000||Give us a copper!
   1191222|00000000||Help a poor bloke out!

   1161910|00000000||Unicorns are thought to like music.
   1161912|00000000||But this is no true unicorn.
   1186574|00000000||Perhaps we should try to hook the golden fish first?
   1186572|00000000||Ofieris are thought to catch horses by casting looped ropes round their necks.
   1186568|00000000||It's Victor, Countess Notturna's steed.
   1186566|00000000||Come, gentlemen! We must catch it! Think of something!
   1186576|00000000||Is it true Her Enlightened Highness has arrived?
   1186539|00000000||Thief!
   1186541|00000000||How dare he!

   1186547|00000000||Yes! Call the guards!
   1186550|00000000||This is an outrage! An outrage, I tell you!
   1186552|00000000||It's against the rules!
   1161908|00000000||Stupid brute.
   1186570|00000000||Did you see that white-haired fellow?
   1186564|00000000||I know it's not real, but it's so beautiful, all the same.

   1175204|00000000||What do you need?

   1175210|00000000||Deadly thirsty…
   1168706|00000000||When Geralt found himself in possession of a card belonging to the Skellige faction, he was incredibly surprised. He'd considered himself something of a gwent expert, yet had never heard of this faction. This card came with an invitation to a gwent tournament organized at the Pheasantry by Count Monnier, so our hero decided to seize this opportunity to find out more and perhaps collect a sweet pot while he was at it.<br>
   1168707|00000000||One day, Geralt came across a notice board with information about a gwent tournament organized by Count Monnier and to be held at the Pheasantry. The witcher, as everyone knew, was not one to turn down a bit of card playing, so he decided to join the event. Little did he know what  surprises awaited him there...<br>
   1168708|00000000||Count Monnier was a man as enterprising as he was creative. He and his brother Igor had decided to perfect gwent by adding a fifth faction: Skellige. The count announced that, if Geralt wished to take part in the tournament, he would be given a basic Skellige deck but would have to build it up himself. To acquire more powerful cards, Geralt had to find and defeat gwent players in Toussaint.<br>
   1168709|00000000||Geralt's deck was deemed worthy by Count Monnier and thus the witcher qualified to enter the tourney. Players from all over the world were to take part in it along with him. There was a nobleman from Novigrad, the Nilfgaardian ambassador, an Ofieri merchant, a contestant from Skellige and the organizer of the tournament himself, Count Monnier.<br>
   1168710|00000000||Geralt proved himself the best gwent player in Toussaint by defeating all comers at the elite tournament. This was doubly happy news, for the tournament might never have come to any conclusion at all. A group of opponents of the new Skellige faction had decided to show up to express their discontent. A tense altercation took place, but luckily both sides kept their cool.<br>
   1168711|00000000||Despite Geralt's best efforts, he failed to emerge victorious at the tournament. Playing his cards well did not, however, turn out to be his only worry during the tournament. While they played, outside the building where the tournament was held a group of tradition-minded lovers of the old rules of gwent gathered to protest the addition of a new faction. After a short fight, the situation was brought under control and the two sides sat down for talks.<br>
   1198402|00000000||Geralt played a final match against a dwarf named Yaki. He knew very well this was a game of key importance, for not only was victory in the tournament at stake, but also Count Monnier's honor and the fate of the new faction he had introduced. In the end, Geralt defeated the dwarf and Yaki proved himself an honorable player by admitting defeat and remaining calm. If only all conflicts in the world could be resolved over a hand of gwent...<br>
   1198403|00000000||Geralt played a final match against a dwarf named Yaki. Despite Geralt's best efforts, his opponent proved the better player and defeated the witcher. This victory so delighted the opponents of the new faction, they decided to make peace with Count Monnier. The traditionalists left the Pheasantry peacefully, confident in their superiority. If only all conflicts in the world could be resolved over a hand of gwent...<br>
   1168576|00000000||Meet with the tournament's organizer.
   1190141|00000000||Return to Count Monnier and get qualified for the tournament.
   1188363|00000000||Find other gwent players and win stronger Skellige faction cards from them. Current deck strength:
   1168644|00000000||Win the tournament.
   1168646|00000000||Fight the dwarves.
   1169894|00000000||Enter the tournament.
   1190178|00000000||Join the tournament.
   1190177|00000000||Come back after two days and join the tournament.
   1198404|00000000||Defeat Yaki the dwarf in a game of gwent.

    562523|6417dbc0||Old Woman
   1187909|00000000||Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
   1187937|00000000||Not the time to give into weakness. You're the commander of her guard, oughta set an example for others. Be dignified, standing guard over her grave. It's what Anna Henrietta would've wanted.
   1187939|00000000||You are right, Geralt, there will be a time to grieve later. My duty to the ducal seat, that comes first now.
   1187726|00000000||[Place flowers on Anna Henrietta's grave.]
   1187730|00000000||I regret it ended this way, that I failed to prevent it… Hope you can forgive me. Rest in peace.
   1187734|00000000||Stylish crypt, quite subdued. Yes, this is the kind of eternal resting place I dream of.
   1187736|00000000||Moments like this, I never know if you're joking or serious…
   1188078|00000000||Serious, Geralt, serious. It's remarkably peaceful, subtly charming to the hilt - a perfect match for the duchess' dignity.
   1188086|00000000||Ahh, you humans, you'll never cease to amaze me. To feel despair in the face of natural processes to which you are predestined… tsk, tsk.
   1188088|00000000||I've come to take you from this place, my friend. Daresay you deserve a speck of respite after the mad whirl of the last few days.
   1187728|00000000||And all this, what did it bring you…? Rest in peace.
   1187725|00000000||[Place flowers on both graves.]
   1187955|00000000||Come to pay my respects, bid the duchess farewell.
   1187957|00000000||White roses, they were her favorite… Go inside then, she lies in the ducal crypt - in one room with her murderer, despite my protests.
   1187959|00000000||What? Who decided that?
   1187961|00000000||The Regents' Council. A pack of old men who've statutes and codices for hearts. Ducal blood flowed in Syanna's veins and she was never legally disinherited, so they ruled she should lie alongside Anarietta.
   1187907|00000000||Don't be so hard on yourself. No one expected Syanna to do that, persist to the end. And none of us did anything to stop her - 'cause there was nothing we could do.
   1187924|00000000||Ehh, I suppose you are right. But when someone so beloved dies, one cannot help but search one's soul for blame. And even the hardiest knights grow faint-hearted, then.
   1187908|00000000||Don't blame yourself.
   1187718|00000000||Witcher… I was certain you'd departed.
   1187903|00000000||Couldn't. Anna Henrietta was…
   1187905|00000000||Wondrous. Beautiful. Good. The best ruler one could hope to have. Yet I let her down.
    487208|f6cf3bee||Bard
   1175039|00000000||Mill from the vision. Where Dettlaff killed de la Croix.
   1175041|00000000||Could find some evidence here, shed more light on what happened.
   1152882|00000000||Calm down.
   1156130|00000000||What of it? Is flour a banned substance these days?
   1152884|00000000||But if they do? See us with all this flour?
   1175037|00000000||Confound it, just as I thought! I knew someone would spy us.
   1152910|00000000||We must make sure he doesn't leave with the news.
   1152912|00000000||Conk him out! Toss him in the river!
   1152880|00000000||I just hope no one sees us.
   1152918|00000000||A notice… De la Croix was out to sell, the mill and adjoining lands.
   1198719|00000000||Definitely the scene of the crime. Not likely to learn much else here, though.
   1152922|00000000||Blood, lots of it… Not all human, either. So this is where Dettlaff lost his hand. And where he quartered de la Croix.
   1152920|00000000||Footprints lead upstairs… No peasant's boots made these.
   1164715|00000000||Wandering around outside the prison, Geralt came upon a desiccated human skeleton. The notes he found on the remains proved interesting…<br>
   1164716|00000000||Strong winds whirled around Crane Isle at all times. So the bones the witcher found were bleached, polished clean. They had belonged to a specialist in escapology. This professional's métier had been to test the invulnerability of penitentiaries to flight by their inmates. He had performed this service around the world, time and again letting himself be imprisoned, then striving to escape.<br>It seemed this had been his last attempt. Yet in the notes he had last compiled, he had also made mention of a sunken elven vault. It was said to lie somewhere in the water near the prison. Needless to say, the witcher was interested…<br>
   1164717|00000000||Geralt located the sunken ruins and the elven riches hidden within them. He collected the latter and promptly set off in search of new adventures, content to be suddenly much better off.<br>
   1164718|00000000||Read the escapologist's journal.
   1164719|00000000||Find the sunken ruins and the elven treasure.
   1201935|00000000||Find a key near the flooded tunnel.

   1165134|00000000||Geralt, we need the catch the umbra. It gets away now, we'll never see it again, no matter how many doped-up slurries you guzzle.
   1169561|00000000||Some kind of glowy magic thing going on with this tombstone. We should check it out.
   1170608|00000000||Long as we're being candid, I gotta ask. Why do you sometimes buck me off in the middle of a fight?
   1170620|00000000||First I've heard. Don't recall that ever happening.
   1170622|00000000||Course you don't.
   1126642|00000000||Heh, heard this one? Horse walks into a tavern, and the innkeep says--
   1126644|00000000||"Hey, pal, why the long face"? HAH!
   1165132|00000000||Slowing… down. Gotta catch my breath.
   1192852|00000000||Geralt, please, no hocus-pocus.
   1169559|00000000||Melted into thin air…
   1165130|00000000||Hey, gotta save my strength a bit. No telling how long we're gonna need to keep running.
   1123316|00000000||Good gods, what's with the overgrown demon cats?! Heeeelp!
   1123314|00000000||Oh, fuck! Geralt! Watch out!
   1123318|00000000||There's the umbra! Let's go, Geralt! After it!
   1195065|00000000||Oh, shit! Sorry, man. You all right?!
   1170575|00000000||Geralt, we gotta have a man-to-horse talk. No offense, but your riding skills? They leave a bit to be desired, buddy.
   1170577|00000000||You'd really do me a solid if you could, uh, apply a slightly surer hand, be a little more decisive about where you want me to go.
   1170579|00000000||Sometimes, I got no idea, buddy. Do I go left, right, twerk where I'm standing…?
   1170588|00000000||Yeah, and it'd be great if could respond more fluidly to my commands…
   1170590|00000000||Let's not lose sight of that umbra. Can you see it now?
   1170592|00000000||Yeah, its' right there. Run, Roach!
   1170594|00000000||What the fuck do you think I'm doing?!
   1199455|063dcb04||Nevin
   1182501|00000000||Uh-huh…?
   1182499|00000000||Hm…?

   1183920|00000000||Welcome, welcome. Tell me what you'd like.
   1188488|00000000||A round of gwent, maybe?
   1188486|00000000||Up for some gwent?
   1183930|00000000||So long.
   1183926|00000000||Farewell.
   1183925|00000000||Show me your goods?
   1183928|00000000||Be so kind as to show me what you have to sell?
   1183922|00000000||Ravix of Fourhorn! Greetings!
   1183924|00000000||Well, well! The one and only Geralt, the Bridge his crest, graces my establishment! What do you need, sir?
   1191484|00000000||Murder! Someone help me, please!
   1191482|00000000||Damnation!
   1191472|00000000||Oh, that's bad luck.
   1191474|00000000||Good day.
   1191476|00000000||I don't believe I know you.
   1191478|00000000||Begone.
   1191480|00000000||Sod off.

   1195716|00000000||Youuuu!
   1195718|00000000||Mh.
   1195720|00000000||Bloody hell.
   1181188|00000000||How am I to enjoy an evening of fun with my jewels all pinched and potted… ?
   1181186|00000000||Oi, that saddle's made mincemeat of my privy-sitter…
   1181192|00000000||Snrrrrk. Sir?
   1181190|00000000||Yes, uncie? I mean, sir!

   1165432|00000000||A drink and a shag, any which way you wish! For cheap!
   1193630|00000000||Did they pamper you properly in prison, son?
   1165428|00000000||Hankering for a fondle?
   1165426|00000000||Hey there, sonny.
   1189629|00000000||Was it tough, ehh? Bashing that Beast?
   1189625|00000000||No one gives a hoot about us poor folk.
   1189627|00000000||Here's some free advice, witchman. If you've no reason to live, live to spite others!
   1189623|00000000||Henrietta, you're breaking my heart…

   1189633|00000000||Good day!
   1189635|00000000||Are you looking to get slapped?!
   1195862|00000000||Greetings.
   1195866|00000000||Hey, you touched it, you bought it!
   1195868|00000000||A good day for commerce.
   1195870|00000000||Come on, no point dallyin'…
   1195872|00000000||Hmmm.
   1195874|00000000||I say!
   1195878|00000000||Help! *Sobs* Aaaa aaa aaa!
   1208772|00000000||Got lucky once. Shoulda quit while you were ahead.
   1171523|00000000||Do something useful.
   1171525|00000000||Come on. Be constructive. Make yourselves useful.
   1171527|00000000||Yes… we should see to the wash, or they'll put us in confinement.
   1171529|00000000||Hey! The mutant's trying charms on us - can't you see? Your tricks won't work here, lad. You cannot mesmerize all three of us at once.
   1190139|00000000||Grab yourselves washboards, boys!
   1208797|00000000||Grab your washboards, boys! Let's show this git who does the scrubbing around here.
   1159428|00000000||Seems fools never learn. Let's get this over with.
   1159425|00000000||Show me what you got.
   1159426|00000000||Stand down. And piss off.
   1208770|00000000||Worry about yourselves. Managed to knock me down once, sure… but that was an accident. I promise.
   1208820|00000000||An accident, you say? Well, those happen all the time. And some men are just prone to them. As you very well might be.
   1208822|00000000||Apart from which, we would not be here if not for you. So think of us as the trap you set for yourself, an accident waiting to happen.
   1159431|00000000||Worry about yourselves. Tried me once already, remember? Didn't work out well, far as I recall. Why tempt fate?
   1159433|00000000||We're changed men. Prison does that to you.
   1159435|00000000||And you're the one who put us here.
   1208824|00000000||Oh, we've been dreaming of this - a miracle by which you would land in here. And voila! Sometimes dreams do come true.
   1150098|00000000||Who have we here…?
   1150100|00000000||The guardian of guttersnipes, locked in the clink. How did that happen?
   1150102|00000000||My, my… What could the duchess' favorite have done to deserve this?
   1150104|00000000||Back off, I'm busy.
   1159419|00000000||Hear that? The laundry wench is busy. Yet I fear we have a matter to resolve. Remember our meeting, bootblack bodyguard?
   1150106|00000000||You go ahead and chit, I'll be back once you're done.
   1150108|00000000||Huh. Thanks for sticking around to help, Jacques.
   1159421|00000000||You're in the coop, mate, only one thing counts here - survival. Folk don't stick their necks out, for anyone besides themselves.
   1159424|00000000||Boohoo. He left you all alone.
   1185431|00000000||Bones ground into dust.
   1185432|00000000||Wildcat hide. A panther's.
   1193523|00000000||"Liber Ivonis" - Conclave of Mages banned this tome.
   1193525|00000000||Notes on the use of yarrow stems. Interesting.
   1193526|00000000||"The Art of Body Transformation."
   1185430|00000000||Warm… Smell's inconclusive. No idea what ingredients're in there.
   1108554|00000000||*Sniff* Wormwood, sulfur, wort… Scent's fresh.
   1137833|00000000||Must've paid a small fortune for this armor. Didn't save him from death, though.
   1108555|00000000||Helmet… Used as a mortar for grinding seeds.
   1165500|00000000||Now bring us some figgy pudding, and bring it right here!
   1165498|00000000||Start your morn with a dash of wine, all day long you'll smell sublime!
   1165504|00000000||Wait, wait, don't tell me - you're that duchess who knows the witcher!
   1165502|00000000||Give us some - hic-cup! - sugar!
   1201496|00000000||Where the White Wolf is drunk, not one soul's in a funk!
   1146434|00000000||It will all work out. It must.
   1146430|00000000||Don't worry, Reginald, don't worry. You shall be whole again soon.
   1165145|00000000||I'm sure you know of Reginald. Heard a great deal, have you?
   1165147|00000000||Actually, not much at all…
   1165149|00000000||Is that so? Why, that's as if you did not know the Nilfgaardian emperor's name.
   1170407|00000000||Reginald was unequaled in many respects. An unmatched lover and swordsman, an artist to boot, a maestro of the lute, harp and accordion.
   1170409|00000000||Adored by women, despised by men… In brief, a legend, truly a legend.

   1194554|00000000||Huh, the duquessa's dead. Something tells me you laid a hand to that, Graytufts!
   1162831|00000000||Quite the bottom, quite the bosom our duchess has, don't you think?
   1162829|00000000||That duchess of ours - have you at least diddled her udders?
   1162833|00000000||Want to learn a magic trick? It's called "fuff off."
   1162835|00000000||Why so figly fiercely tense, friend?

   1162839|00000000||You popped bum hole!
   1162841|00000000||Filthy goatknobber!
   1181674|00000000||Gate's locked from the inside. Clearly been jostled, though. Something tried to get out.
   1186253|00000000||Brrrr, the very thought sends a cold wind down my back.
   1186470|00000000||Servant… Stabbed to death. Over a dozen blows with a sharp object, some postmortem.
   1187633|00000000||I cannot believe this the work of a man. It was a monster, to be sure!
   1186462|00000000||Throat's massacred. One mighty blow. Shield alongside's old and dented. Sword's ceremonial. Aen Seidhe handiwork, clearly…
   1197580|00000000||Hmm… Somehow doubt I'll ever know what happened here.
   1205196|00000000||Someone tried to scale the wall but fell. Probably tried to flee the estate, but couldn't get the gate open. Not likely to have gotten far, lost too much blood…
   1194614|00000000||Dammit…
   1202614|00000000||Good gods!
   1186460|00000000||What the hells' this? Setting for a banquet?
   1187625|00000000||It seems so. What's your suspicion? Did none survive? Gods…
   1186488|00000000||Torso punctured with great force. Blow pierced hardened steel. Man on the high road - breastplate was identical.
   1183326|00000000||Burn marks. Something catch fire? Explode? Strong stench…
   1181570|00000000||Strange armor… wound's unusual, too. What's going on here?
   1186513|00000000||Burned alive… Really high temperature at work here.
   1205146|00000000||Lebioda, thou art my defender and protector, thou bringest good news…
   1186519|00000000||Fled… Then dropped to the ground to douse the flames. Didn't manage.
   1205148|00000000||Burnt smell's growing fainter. Might've been another, luckier soul, managed to flee.
   1194898|00000000||Doublet's scorched… Wriggled out of it, tossed it, then ran on.
   1181057|00000000||What's that about?
   1183273|00000000||Silver tableware? Elven engravings…
   1183324|00000000||Multiple wounds on the body. All puncture wounds, but hard to tell what caused them. Victim's human… but the attire's elven.
   1186274|00000000||Are you certain? How did he come by it? We've so few nonhumans in Toussaint.
   1201378|00000000||Must've been here he broke his legs. Fell while climbing over the wall. Trying to leave the property, probably, after he didn't manage to open the gate.
   1199052|00000000||Gate's locked from the inside but got jostled pretty hard. Barely hanging on the hinges.
   1181661|00000000||Trail leads towards the house on the hill.
   1186247|00000000||Which stands silent as a grave…

   1187635|00000000||Of what? Please do not say humans…
   1205203|00000000||Trail's taking me down the path…
   1205498|00000000||Why're you here?
   1205500|00000000||I-I saw you walking toward the estate. To leave you to risk this alone, it would not be fair. I could be of use, perhaps…?
   1205502|00000000||Doubt it. But stay if you want. Just, not one peep, please. And don't touch anything.

   1102266|00000000||Hold on!
   1193556|00000000||Hold, there! Do not kill the brute without me!
   1188719|00000000||Do you fear taking a bath?
   1188721|00000000||Put your own house in order first.

   1198804|00000000||Instead of hunting the Beast, the witcher hunted for Reginald's missing jewels! But to give credit where it's due, he did find them.
   1189689|00000000||Guard! Save me! Guard!
   1189697|00000000||I, too, sat out a spell in the clink. No shame in it, witcher!
   1189693|00000000||Better to die of drink than of boredom.
   1189695|00000000||You'll not find work here. Not paying work, that is.
   1189691|00000000||That one has it good… A vineyard from the duchess, for doing jack-diddly…
   1198810|00000000||What the hey-diddle-diddle do I care…?
   1198812|00000000||How about that…
   1189701|00000000||How goes it, friend?
   1189699|00000000||My deepest regards.

   1211411|00000000||The hermit who lived on the isle on Lac Célavy had become the guardian of the duchy’s Five Principle Virtues. This virtuous man watched over the boulders on which the virtues had been engraved and put any knights who came by through a trial to prove they embodied them. When the witcher arrived at the isle and met with the hermit, it seemed to him it was not their first encounter. Only later did he find out how right he was.<br><br>
   1211412|00000000||The hermit turned out to be the Lady of the Lake, a mysterious being whom Geralt had once met in Murky Waters. After Geralt passed the hermit’s trials, the holy man changed form and showed him his true face, then bestowed upon Geralt a gift: the sword Aerondight.

   1170004|00000000||<i>I was gathering berries, as one does this time of year, when suddenly the trees shook and I saw this… this thing…</i><br> – fragment of a story told by a woman returning from the woods.<br><br>Spriggans are a subspecies of the monsters known as leshens. One is liable to come across them in inaccessible, unfrequented woodlands. They do not usually attack humans if unprovoked, but when irritated they can be quite fearsome, and, as they possess considerable strength, they are capable of doing great damage. Their appetite is such that they can devour more flesh than an army at a wedding.<br><br>Each spriggan has mastery over plants and is inextricably tied to them. Thus if someone destroys greenery in its domain, it immediately comes to punish the disturber.<br>
   1170005|00000000||In combat a spriggan makes skilled use of its powerful limbs. When riled it attacks swiftly and forcefully, which, given its considerable mass, can prove highly problematic. <br><br>Its calloused hide can deflect even strong blows from a sword, and there can be no thought of parrying the spriggan’s attacks. One must keep an eye out for roots, which the spriggan will attempt to use to entangle its foe.<br><br>It can also teleport – in such cases it suddenly appears directly in front of its foe and attacks. The Aard Sign does not work against it, for no force on earth can knock it over.

   1106275|00000000||On one of the notice boards of Beauclair Geralt found a very interesting contract. A certain man was looking for a discrete specialist in the supernatural. Geralt had the feeling this was directed at someone more or less just like him.<br>
   1106276|00000000||A local art curator asked Geralt for help in a matter concerning the statue of Reginald d’Aubry – a local legend and national hero.

Geralt accepted the contract, not knowing he was in for quite the shock when the details of what he was to investigate and why were made known.<br>
   1106278|00000000||Geralt tracked down the thief and confronted him, only to be confronted himself with a most atypical offer. The man wanted to borrow "Beauclair's most valuable jewels" for a few more days so he could... finish some things. Geralt showed understanding (a nod being as good as a wink to our worldly friend) and promised to return in a week. Do you know the saying about the butterfly that flaps its wings in Kovir and causes a hurricane in Cintra? All decisions have entirely unpredictable consequences, and this was no exception – the poor Hughes' heart could not bear his amatory gusto and burst from overexertion. The witcher was left with half his reward and a guilty conscience.<br>
   1111680|00000000||There are some parts of the White Wolf's story best passed over in silence. Loyalty to my friend does not allow me to say the famed witcher was sucker punched by a cuckolded husband even though he had nothing to do with the cuckolding in question... so it shall have to suffice to say Reginald's statue was not returned to its former glory. The rest will fade into oblivion. <br>
   1106277|00000000||Geralt was able to retrieve "Beauclair's most valuable jewels"  and Reginald d'Aubry's statue was once again made whole. Thanks to this, both the curator and a great number of local matrons were highly satisfied, people in general were more relaxed and merry, a bumper crop of children was on its way and tourism to Beauclair reached new heights. All thanks to a humble witcher.<br>

   1125294|00000000||Incredible! The witcher has parried Colossus' blows! No one's ever managed that feat!
   1125296|00000000||Here's your due.
   1125298|00000000||Thanks.
   1125300|00000000||The witcher defeats Colossus in a regulation bout. A captivating clash to say the least!
   1125302|00000000||You thump hard, you thump well, master witcher.
   1125304|00000000||Thanks.
   1125318|00000000||Now to face the Maestro, all you've left are rumbles with Mancomb and the knight known as Still Waters.
   1192194|00000000||Seek out the knight in the heart of Hauteville, near Mountebank Alley. Whereas Mancomb loiters about the docks south of that district.
   1125322|00000000||Only one combatant remains - the knight known as Still Waters. Defeat him, and you will gain the right to challenge the Maestro. Look for the knight in Hauteville, near Mountebank Alley.
   1125324|00000000||You've earned my esteem, sir. We've not seen such a feat in years. And thus you've secured the right to challenge the Maestro himself. You'll find him by the docks.
   1125320|00000000||Only Mancomb now stands between you and your duel with the Maestro. Look for him by the docks south of Hauteville.
   1178427|00000000||Well, well. You're quick. Gray tufts and all.
   1125306|00000000||The witcher proved unable to deflect Colossus' blows.
   1125308|00000000||As was easy to predict. If you're ever in the mood for another clobbering, stop by.
   1125310|00000000||The witcher withered beneath Colossus' stature.
   1125312|00000000||You should've agreed just to parry. Better luck next time, maybe. Though I doubt it will help much.
   1125343|00000000||Whoa! Bad form! You were solely to deflect his blows - you agreed! Yet here you come a-pummeling! The fight is over!

   1213780|00000000||The fourth group of missing workers had been due to travel to the building site through an area with a very bad reputation. In setting out to find them, Geralt expected trouble of none too modest sort.<br>
   1213781|00000000||As it turned out, the workers' encampment had been swarmed by kikimores. Geralt failed to find even one living soul in the camp, so he tracked the monsters to their lair, where he found a number of dead bodies. Alas, all the workers had been killed.<br>
   1214146|00000000||While traversing Toussaint’s interior, Geralt came across an abandoned campsite. His intuition told him something unfortunate had happened in this place and he decided to investigate.
   1214147|00000000||Following the tracks he found, our hero arrived at a den of kikimores and determined the men from the campsite had been killed by these monsters. Only later did Geralt find out these men had been builders working on the Prophet Lebioda’s statue.
   1212744|00000000||Investigate the workers' camp.

   1205133|00000000||When Geralt first agreed to look into problems at some vineyards in Toussaint, he had not expected these matters to occupy him for long. When the witcher then learned Count Crespi had provoked the quarrel between the vineyard owners, an end to the mess was finally in sight. The ducal clerk was clearly pleased to see Liam de Coronata and Matilda Vermentino join forces. And he agreed to transfer Belgaard to them jointly on one condition - they would first need to resolve the troubles at their home estates.<br>
   1205136|00000000||Not monsters, not bandits - Geralt feared nothing! He quickly tended to the problems at Coronata and Vermentino, then set off to see the co-owners of the newly formed consortium to collect the reward they had promised him.<br>

   1208548|00000000||Not all knights errant in Toussaint were embodiments of virtue, but if I had to choose one among them who did personify their chivalric creed, it would be Palmerin de Launfal. He is all the more admirable for the fact that, years ago, he was no stranger to the pleasures of eating, drinking and making merry in a variety of fashions. With time, however, he abandoned vice and drew closer to the knightly ideal. Geralt realized this when Palmerin came to him as an envoy from Anna Henrietta. The old-fashioned and somewhat naive knight immediately made a good impression on him, for while he did take formalities and courtesies a tad too seriously, he was anything but pompous or grandiose.

   1208708|00000000||<i>Looked like a bruxa, but that was no bruxa… </i> <br> – fragment of a conversation between the ealdorman of Falkoane and a witcher.<br><br>Alps are vampires that resemble bruxae in appearance. They are called phantoms by some, a name which fits well enough, for like phantoms they haunt and torment men. They usually take on the form of a woman, though they can also appear as animals. They are most often found prowling near villages. They attack at night and are most active when the moon is full. Alp saliva can make one fall asleep, and when applied to a sleeping man, can invoke horrible nightmares. Some suggest they are the cause of legends about men who go to sleep healthy and are found in the morning white as snow, not a drop of blood in their veins.<br>
   1208709|00000000||In combat alps display supernatural speed and incredible (even by vampire standards) stamina. One must aim one’s sword with great precision, for alps are unequaled in the art of evading blows. The Yrden Sign is recommended, for it weakens an alp’s defenses. Another strategy is to drink the Black Blood potion, for alps suck the blood of their victims to deprive them of strength and regenerate their own powers.<br><br>Unlike bruxae, alps cannot turn invisible, yet like bruxae, they emit a shrieking noise whose shock wave can incapacitate. Their greatest asset is their agility and they can leap with uncanny lightness that appears to border on the power of flight. When in human form, they easily blend in with the surrounding community, which makes them very dangerous indeed.

   1199524|00000000||A key.
   1193877|00000000||Hey! Wait!
   1193881|00000000||Stop! It's important!
   1185315|00000000||He's ruined the game!
   1185317|00000000||Disgraceful!
   1166368|00000000||Why, you bumbotched wretch!
   1185321|00000000||Don't cry, dear. The duchess will hear of this.
   1185323|00000000||This is an outrage!
   1209301|00000000||Welcome to the court of King Cormorant.
   1160978|00000000||I vow on the crane that I shall fight with honor. And I dedicate this fight to you, my Lady.
   1160980|00000000||I accept your vow.
   1207244|00000000||I vow upon the crane--
   1207246|00000000||I believe I've made myself clear. I shall not grant you leave. It's out of the question.
   1207240|00000000||My Lady, I have a fierce wish to fight fiercely in your name and fiercely ask your permission to so do.
   1207242|00000000||My permission thus I grant you, sir.
   1138587|00000000||Master witcher! What luck to happen upon you!
   1097494|00000000||Got work for me? A new contract?
   1097496|00000000||Of the contract in question you acquitted yourself beautifully years past, on your last sojourn in Beauclair.
   1177200|00000000||I was in a bit of a bind at the time… Do you remember? Yet I swore a solemn vow to pay you in full one day.
   1097498|00000000||Guess it rings a bell…
   1097500|00000000||Sadly, you went on your way before I could settle matters with you. So I took your coin and placed it in an account for safekeeping.
   1104614|00000000||Hm. What kind of account?
   1138372|00000000||A savings account. At Cianfanelli Bank. You need but walk in and withdraw. The sum must be rather substantial by now…
   1178854|00000000||Thanks. Head over there first chance I get.
   1153733|00000000||Good to see you again.
   1123988|00000000||Ah, the serendipity! I'm so glad you're back!
   1175198|00000000||I'm listening.
   1175196|00000000||Out with it.
   1175200|00000000||I wonder how much a witcher pays in taxes…
   1175202|00000000||In fact, I wonder if a witcher pays any taxes at all…
   1191191|00000000||Hmmm?
   1191193|00000000||Ta ra ri rrra ra…
   1200067|00000000||There we are. Merten wrote a prayer on the back of the diagram.
   1188981|00000000||Seems he left the prison, came here, then went on to the temple…
   1200065|00000000||Slips of paper all over, prayer on each one. Maybe Merten left one, too.
   1189267|00000000||The cave Merten mentioned. Need to look around.
   1202699|00000000||Looks like the place mentioned in the journal. Should search it.
   1161422|00000000||Why, that's…
   1161424|00000000||Ooh!
   1161426|00000000||Her Grace! The duquessa!
   1211227|00000000||He was here before, years ago. I saw him then.
   1211229|00000000||Who is he?
   1211231|00000000||A monster slayer.
   1195890|00000000||The witcher bested all our knights at the tourney! Must have mountain-sized stones! Hahaha!
   1195892|00000000||Thank you, master witcher! Loth Halfbreed's hanse, now that was a mean bunch of harlotsbroods!
   1172496|00000000||What are your needs, master?
   1172494|00000000||Here, master witcher! Over here!
   1172500|00000000||Master witcher?
   1172498|00000000||Well met!
   1172502|00000000||Master witcher, restrain yourself…
   1172504|00000000||Hey, slow, now!
   1183160|00000000||Eh. I don't know.
   1183158|00000000||What? You want to fight?
   1183162|00000000||I weewee on everything.
   1183164|00000000||Emperor - I weewee on him. Knights - weewee on them. Guard - you bet I wee on them. I weewee on the whole bleeding duchy!
   1188096|00000000||Intending to take a refreshing dip in Seidhe Llygad, Geralt happened on a corpse. Unsurprisingly, this quelled his desire to dive into the lake's shimmering waters. Yet on the corpse, which proved to be that of a suicide, he found a letter…<br>
   1188097|00000000||The letter spoke of the love that had bloomed between Selina and Bruce - two famed Beauclairois cat burglars. It also detailed the sad end of the duo's story. But any tale of burglars is a tale of their loot. Always a big spender and thus ever in need of coin, the witcher resolved to find the hidden treasure.<br>
   1188098|00000000||Geralt discovered he was not the lone prospector for the treasure Selina had left behind. So he quickly cut down his competitors, a band of grave robbers, and made off with the loot.<br>
   1214275|00000000||While exploring the catacombs beneath the city cemetery, Geralt ran into a crew of grave robbers. Giggling and cursing, the band of robbers swarmed the witcher, which ended tragically for them…<br>
   1214276|00000000||On the gang leader's rapidly cooling corpse, Geralt found an interesting letter from which he learned about Selina's Gang and a treasure that supposedly lay concealed in the tomb of a now dead but once famous woman burglar. Yet to get at the treasure, the witcher needed a key.<br>
   1214290|00000000||Bruce, Selina's erstwhile lover, had the key. Grieving after having lost his beloved and unable to bear life alone, Bruce had chosen suicide, jumped in the lake and drowned.<br>
   1214292|00000000||Content to have found the key, Geralt returned to the gloomy catacombs and unlocked a chest full of valuables.. Since none of the members of the gang remained alive, the witcher could take all the wealth for himself with a clear conscience, then set off in search of new adventures.
   1188099|00000000||Read the letter.
   1188100|00000000||Find the treasure hidden in the cemetery.
   1214277|00000000||Read the letter the grave robber was carrying.
   1214278|00000000||Search the shore of the lake near Orlémurs Cemetery.

   1213786|00000000||<i>Beann'shies howl and shriek, and if you hear their cry, you can know you’ll join the ranks of the dead that night.</i><br>– beggar from Dun Dâre<br><br>Old gossips claim beann'shies are the spirits of women stuck between life and death due to traumatic experiences. Their wails and howls are considered ill omens of imminent, inevitable death, though they are said not to attack the living themselves. Most often they appear in the form of pale, tear-streaked women with shriveled faces and wrinkled, corpse-like bodies.<br>
   1213790|00000000||Beann'shies are wraiths which use their piercing cries to wake the dead to fight their foes. Their cries can additionally stun enemies, making them easy targets for direct attacks.<br><br>Beann'shies can regenerate, but this does not mean they cannot be defeated – they are vulnerable to silver and wraith oil as well as the witcher Signs (though they are known to be resistant to the Signs’ critical effects).<br><br>When fighting a beann'shie, there is no point using bombs or bolts, for they will do the wraith no damage.

    349476|9f537fff||Boy
   1158211|00000000||A witcher.
   1158645|00000000||A witcher. And I'd advise you to go back where you came from.
   1158647|00000000||I thought witchers defend men from monsters, not cheats from justice!
   1158649|00000000||Need to talk to the boy.
   1158651|00000000||You can chat with him all you like - after we tan his hide! So stand down!
   1158212|00000000||Not your concern.
   1158660|00000000||All you need to know is, long as I'm here, you're not gonna touch the boy.
   1158662|00000000||Is that so? Then we'll come find him once you're gone.
   1158664|00000000||Try it, and I'll find you.
   1158666|00000000||Is that a threat?!
   1158668|00000000||Yep. Leave the kid be and piss off.
   1158670|00000000||Oh, no! No northern sheepdiddler insults us!
   1158672|00000000||We'll pummel the swine first, then spank the piglet! Get him!
   1158638|00000000||Not gonna happen.
   1158640|00000000||Won't it? Well, then we will thrash you as well. Which is all the same to me.
   1158625|00000000||His father. And you won't touch him. I won't let you.
   1158632|00000000||Oh, poppycock! I knew his father! A grifter, a cheat, just like his brood!
   1158634|00000000||I'll teach him honesty! He'll not leave muck at our shop door just to draw patrons to his own stall!
   1158636|00000000||So back away, drifter!
   1158210|00000000||His father.
   1158207|00000000||Leave him alone.
   1158209|00000000||Just who the spit are you?
   1156529|00000000||So how would you explain it?! Whether it pours for a week or the sun bakes our pates, we've always mud up to our ankles here!
   1158013|00000000||You can't blame me for Beauclair's fickle weather.
   1158015|00000000||Fickle weather?! I've seen you! You empty your chamber pot in front of our shop each morn. So folk will dirty their boots, go to you to get them cleaned!
   1158017|00000000||A far-fetched conspiracy theory, sirs…
   1156628|00000000||I'll conspire to welt your bum with my belt! Come here!
   1156622|00000000||Caught you, you little fart!
   1158007|00000000||Whatever's the problem, kind sirs?
   1156624|00000000||This mud! Rain or shine, it's always here! And now we know why!
   1158009|00000000||You dump your waste in front of our shop! We saw you!
   1156626|00000000||Oh my, sirs, you really ought to go easy on the wine.
   1156541|00000000||Bootblacks don't usually work nights. Need to come back during the day.
   1156640|00000000||We'll break your legs, vagrant!
   1156642|00000000||Teach you to help scofflaws and cheats!
   1175091|00000000||Not now, Geralt… I could not move a step without your assistance.
   1181180|00000000||Just and true, the knight returned, from his days at war, yet the lass, for whom he'd pined and yearned, had married days before.
   1181178|00000000||To you, my dear, I've sworn my heart. My soul's sweet sovereign, my queen, thou art…
   1181184|00000000||Sir?
   1181182|00000000||Yes, sir?
   1186637|00000000||Ahem… Uh, so, I'll be at the boat landing near the palace… waiting for Regis there… Mind telling him?
   1188862|00000000||[Stay here.]
   1188861|00000000||[Go to meet Regis.]
   1180019|00000000||You've met with Orianna. How did it go?
   1151876|00000000||Yeah, I know. You'd still prefer to free Syanna - for Dettlaff's sake.
   1153144|00000000||For the sake of you both.
   1167501|00000000||Oh, please. Orphanage, what happened there - his fault, plain and simple. City gutters are overflowing with blood - that's his doing, too. And you're worried somebody might've hurt his feelings?
   1167503|00000000||To meet the Unseen Elder is to face mortal danger - I've said so all along and never in jest. You are a friend, a dear friend. I'd rather you not risk your neck unnecessarily - I think it's natural, I think it's obvious. Obviously natural. Especially when we've an alternative. An entirely reasonable one.
   1151880|00000000||Time we were on our way. Listen, I need to sail there… Coming with, or would you rather float over as a puff of fog?
   1151882|00000000||I'd not be able to talk as a puff. And, as you know, talking is something I very much like to do.
   1166625|00000000||Mhm. At length and in detail. Let's go.
   1176976|00000000||Unseen Elder - let's find him.
   1176979|00000000||Need a little time to prepare, now. Wait here for me?
   1176981|00000000||I shall await you at our destination, if it's all the same to you. So, see you… though, try not to make me wait too long.
   1176977|00000000||Need some time to prepare.
   1151816|00000000||I'm a witcher, Regis. I don't cut deals with monsters, I cut monsters down. And I don't give a damn about the risks.
   1153188|00000000||Hm, well… I understand. I'll not mention it again.
   1153194|00000000||Thanks.
   1151812|00000000||Won't change my mind, Period.
   1153706|00000000||Ugh… fine, have it your way. We'll free Syanna. If we can even figure out where she's being held, 'cause--
   1153708|00000000||I've looked into it already.
   1153710|00000000||Oh yeah?
   1153712|00000000||Mhm. I managed to convince Damien to help us. He claims Syanna was last seen in the palace playroom.
   1153714|00000000||A playroom? For children? What'd the duchess do, lock her in a dollhouse?
   1153716|00000000||Perhaps, I don't know. We must see for ourselves. Come.
   1181527|00000000||Ugh, you've worn me down, Regis. Fine, have it your way. Playroom - let's go.
   1181666|00000000||Excellent decision.
   1181668|00000000||Time'll tell.
   1151811|00000000||Fine. Let's go find Syanna.
   1181525|00000000||Perhaps we could give it one more try? I mean, we were so close…
   1181655|00000000||Mhm. But I changed my mind.
   1181657|00000000||Yet perhaps you'd care to reconsider once more?
   1208913|00000000||Don't push it, Regis. Orphanage - Dettlaff's fault. City gutters are overflowing with blood. Also his doing. And you're worried somebody might've hurt his feelings? Come on.
   1181659|00000000||In meeting the Unseen Elder you will risk all. You cannot be certain to leave with your life. Yet if we meet Dettlaff's demand, the killing will cease at once.
   1180021|00000000||Not well.
   1180023|00000000||Oh? Did she not divulge where you might find the Unseen?
   1180025|00000000||No, she did. Also divulged her hunger for the blood of small children.
   1180031|00000000||I admit I'd heard rumors, but… preferred to lend them no credence.
   1177107|00000000||Rather not talk about it. Cave's west of town, other side of the lake. That's where we need to go.
   1177111|00000000||I see. I'm prepared to set out at any time, but…
   1181619|00000000||So, you decided to talk to Orianna after all… How did you fare?
   1188889|00000000||Greetings, Geralt.
   1165418|00000000||Ought we begrudge fair-faced ladies their airs,
   1165420|00000000||When trees in high canopies hide the best apples and pears?
   1165422|00000000||I'll be your long-haired lover from Novigrad, and I'll do anything you say.
   1193624|00000000||Will you invite me back to your vineyard?
   1165416|00000000||Ha ha ha ha!
   1165414|00000000||Tra la lee la!
   1189609|00000000||All possible punishments have visited us…
   1189611|00000000||When the duquessa laughs, it's no laughing matter!
   1189613|00000000||Are you still here?! But you're the very reason the duquessa's dead!
   1189607|00000000||That the Guard puts up with a butcher in our midst…
   1189615|00000000||Your armor must've chafed the sense out of you!
   1189621|00000000||Pop around the corner, see if you're not there.
   1189617|00000000||Ehh, go stick a carrot up your nose.
   1189619|00000000||Beetrooting lummox!
   1156190|00000000||Think you could craft something for me?
   1178482|00000000||Craft something for me?
   1211258|00000000||Wanna place a special order. Think you can handle it?
   1211260|00000000||How special is it to be?
   1211262|00000000||Got these diagrams. Take a look, judge for yourself.
   1211265|00000000||Tsk, alas. It's black magic to me. But I know one who could help you.
   1211267|00000000||You must try Lafargue. His smithy lies near the Metinna Gate.
   1211256|00000000||Think you can decipher these diagrams?
   1156196|00000000||Farewell.
   1178485|00000000||No. See you later!
   1178483|00000000||Farewell.
   1178481|00000000||Show me your wares.
   1156188|00000000||Show me what you have.
   1156180|00000000||Oh, look! A witcher graces my humble forge.
   1156182|00000000||The best steel in all of Toussaint! Take a gander.
   1192490|00000000||Eh, bumbersnatch. Happens to the best. It serves me right for challenging a stranger. To have such a deck, ah….
   1192492|00000000||So long.
   1192494|00000000||Hm, I expected more of you. But, I suppose you put in an honest effort. You know what they say - tables are like day-old fish, apt to turn on you when you least expect it.
   1192496|00000000||Right…
   1201397|00000000||I shall tell you this much… when first I heard Maid Matilda had forged a partnership with the ever slippery Liam, well, I near popped a cork!
   1201399|00000000||But once it was revealed the dingledong had not, in fact, been responsible for our woes, I thought to myself…
   1201401|00000000||I suppose it's about time Maid Matilda found a mister, is it not?
   1201046|00000000||Greetings, Geralt!
   1152234|00000000||Craft something for me?
   1152239|00000000||Craft something for me, can you?
   1201044|00000000||Here we are. Is there some way I might help you?
   1152237|00000000||All right. What do you have?
   1152233|00000000||Show me your wares?
   1152241|00000000||Thanks, see you later.
   1152235|00000000||Take care.
   1201327|00000000||Bandits aren't your only problem, don't think…
   1201368|00000000||Vineyard 's glory days seem like a thing of the past…
   1201370|00000000||It's seen better times, true. For bandits are not our only problem. Enormous yellow parasites, their ever-growing plague, we also must contend with.
   1201372|00000000||Maid Matilda tries her best, but when folk fear to go out and work, what is she to do?
   1199562|00000000||I thank you again for your aid! Till we meet at Vermentino.
   1201867|00000000||Fine, lead the way.
   1201047|00000000||Fine, let's go.
   1201869|00000000||Go ahead. I'll stop by when I'm in the area.
   1201048|00000000||I'll come by later.
   1152232|00000000||I owe you my life, unknown knight. How are you dubbed?
   1201195|00000000||Dubbed Geralt. Geralt of Rivia.
   1201197|00000000||My thanks, Sir Geralt! The scallywags sought to demolish our herb garden, you see! I thought, I shall take a hammer, scare the rabble off, but…
   1201367|00000000||To my great chagrin, there were too many and I, I failed!
   1201199|00000000||Ehh, there's no use crying over spilt wine. Come with me to Vermentino, I'll patch up your armor or pound the anvil to fulfill some other need you might have.
   1205933|00000000||Help! Save me!
   1191828|00000000||And with that we're safe! All thanks to the witcher!
   1188142|00000000||Have you found de Peyrac-Peyran?
   1188144|00000000||Not yet.
   1188134|00000000||Perhaps we should stop the diversion after all.
   1188132|00000000||We've searched for Milton this whole time. And we've nothing to show for it.

   1191796|00000000||We're to kiss the ground you walk on, is that it? But you just did your diddly witcherly duty!
   1162811|00000000||Mean to hunt the Beast?
   1162809|00000000||So, Snow White, what's new?
   1162819|00000000||Heighdie-heighdie-heighdie-ho!
   1162815|00000000||Where there is smoke, there is fire!
   1162817|00000000||Oh, you are so bimbazzled…
   1162813|00000000||I'll crack, thwack and sgack you!
   1193638|00000000||Why the wide stride? A keepsake from your stay in the clink?
   1162821|00000000||A group of rogues walks amidst the trees, willies aswinging betwixt their knees!
   1162823|00000000||When I was a little lad, my stones stank awfully bad.
   1162825|00000000||Hoping it would cure the smell, I dipped my pouch in a well…
    337979|df72b608||Imlerith
   1206093|00000000||Tell me about yourself?
   1206098|00000000||Doing a great job here…
   1206100|00000000||For a woman, you mean?
   1206102|00000000||For anyone. Learned long ago not to judge men and women by different standards.
   1206104|00000000||That's nice to hear. I'd dreamt of running this vineyard since I was a child. My mother was a wash maid, found a position here. She would bring me along and while she laundered the linens I would play with the cats.
   1206106|00000000||Lady Vermentino always fed me sweet grapes. And for a few brief moments I would imagine she was my mother, even wish it so.
   1206126|00000000||When my real mother passed away, the Vermentinos took me in. They had no children of their own.
   1206108|00000000||Thus I became Matilda de Vermentino. In the end I got my dream, though at times I'm still tortured by the thought that my secret wish might've brought about my birth mother's death.
   1204679|00000000||Witcher! How good of you to come! Any news?
   1206072|00000000||Tell me about yourself?
   1206080|00000000||Come from a long line of vintners, don't you.
   1206082|00000000||Yes, my great-grandpapa planted the first seeds at Coronata. Yet my father made the vineyard bloom.
   1206084|00000000||He had hoped one of my elder brothers would take up the hoe and grape knife. Alas, he proved a tyrant. All eight fled, wanting nothing to do with winemaking.
   1206086|00000000||I graduated Oxenfurt Academy and returned home to find myself up to my ears in work. I set my own plans aside, then abandoned them. But I regret nothing. I've grown to love the trade.
   1204667|00000000||Witcher, you're here! Any news?
   1206071|00000000||You can start operating normally.
   1206110|00000000||Shouldn't have any more problems with the vineyard. You can start operating normally again.
   1209341|00000000||Splendid. And thus, officially, by the power vested in me, I grant you title to the Belgaard Vineyard and trust that you shall restore it to its former glory, mademoiselle.
   1209343|00000000||I shall do everything in my power.
   1206114|00000000||Thank you. You're truly worth your weight in gold! Ah, if my mother could see this… She always wanted a better future for me, and now, thanks to you, I might actually have one.
   1206116|00000000||Here. Your reward as agreed.
   1206118|00000000||Thanks. And good luck.
   1205425|00000000||All's well at Belgaard. Took care of the problems.
   1209333|00000000||Splendid. And thus, officially, by the power vested in me, I grant you title to the Belgaard Vineyard and trust that you shall make good use of its grounds and resources.
   1205427|00000000||Thank you! Ah, I can already taste this vineyard's first young wines… Scrumptious.
   1205429|00000000||Don't let the vapors go to your head…
   1205708|00000000||Witcher - your pay. The amount we agreed. Now forgive me, I must get to work, look over the suppliers' bids. Liam was to do it, but he's busy, as you can see…
   1205431|00000000||Ehh, I fear this will not be an easy partnership… I just hope we don't end up killing one another. All the same, I thank you for your help.
   1205433|00000000||Good luck. So long.
   1204644|00000000||Tended to Belgaard's problems. Vineyard should be in as good a shape as ever.
   1209330|00000000||Splendid. And thus, officially, by the power vested in me, I grant you title to the Belgaard Vineyard and trust that you shall make good use of its grounds and resources.
   1204646|00000000||Excellent! Ah, I can already smell the grapes ripening in the sun…
   1204648|00000000||We shan't forget what you did for us. Here, your pay.
   1204650|00000000||But that's not all. You must come back and see us shortly. We've a surprise in store for you.
   1204652|00000000||I'll do that. Farewell.
   1206075|00000000||Tended to Belgaard's problems. Think you can start producing wine.
   1209336|00000000||Splendid. And thus, officially, by the power vested in me, I grant you title to the Belgaard Vineyard and trust that you shall prove a wise, interested, resolute steward.
   1209338|00000000||Thank you!
   1206077|00000000||You've saved my derriere! Ah, fortune's smiled on me since you showed up. While you were out there, I found a case with my father's notes in the cellar.
   1206089|00000000||He left a whole tome's-worth, discussing which vines do best in this climate. Now that the vineyard can operate normally at last, for the first time in a long while I feel everything is falling into place. This is for you.
   1206091|00000000||Thanks. And good luck.
   1206073|00000000||Farewell.
   1206088|00000000||Farewell.
   1206094|00000000||Farewell.
   1206092|00000000||Vineyard can start operating normally again.
   1204048|00000000||Decidedly too dear, that.
   1204050|00000000||Could you shave a whisker off?
   1204065|00000000||Ahem, my desire for Belgaard to pass into capable hands was no idle whim. For the vineyard's fallen upon hard times since its previous owner's demise.
   1204067|00000000||I have been told of workers dying on their rounds, monsters prowling about… Before anyone can call this home, they will have to deal with these… inconveniences. That is the minister's wish.
   1204069|00000000||More work for me, I guess…
   1204086|00000000||If you're willing, I'd gladly accept your help.
   1204054|00000000||Oh, sorry, I can't possibly afford that. I hope you'll help me all the same.
   1204052|00000000||A fair price.
   1204091|00000000||Need to think this over.
   1204102|00000000||Got some other things on my plate. Need to think this through. Might look in on you if I'm in the area.
   1204104|00000000||I will be very grateful if you do.
   1205421|00000000||It certainly seems so. But if we're to make anything of this partnership, in itself a difficult notion, we must be able to work, without hindrance or threat.
   1205423|00000000||So? Will you help our fragile consortium?
   1204084|00000000||If you're willing, we'll gladly accept your help.
   1204071|00000000||Let's talk about my pay.
   1204078|00000000||I can help, sure, but I won't work for free.
   1204040|00000000||Too much. Definitely too much.
   1204042|00000000||A bit less? Is that out of the question?
   1204044|00000000||Fine. We have a deal.
   1204046|00000000||No, too much. Take what we offer, please, we can afford no more.
   1204122|00000000||I'll get to work.
   1204074|00000000||More or less already agreed, I guess…
   1204076|00000000||Phew, that's a weight off my chest, I must say. Your reward shall be fair, I promise.
   1204070|00000000||Sure. I'll help you.
   1204072|00000000||Lemme give it a think.
   1204080|00000000||I'll look into it if I pass by. All I can promise.
   1204082|00000000||It's something, thank you.
   1204088|00000000||Really? You'd help? Agree and I shall pay you exceedingly well.
   1204056|00000000||That's much too much.
   1204058|00000000||A bit less, could you? I'm no millionaire.
   1204093|00000000||Let's talk about my pay.
   1209328|00000000||Need to talk about my fee, first.
   1204060|00000000||That certainly sounds reasonable. Agreed.
   1204062|00000000||I've a dire need, and you seek to take advantage. Take what I offer, for truly I can afford no more.
   1204110|00000000||Don't know that I wanna get any more involved. One thing I can promise - if I come across anything dangerous, I'll definitely react.
   1204112|00000000||Naturally, I wouldn't ask for anything more.
   1204094|00000000||Need to think it over.
   1204092|00000000||I'll help.
   1204106|00000000||Ah, in for a copper, in for a crown… Yeah, I'll help.
   1204108|00000000||Thank you.
   1204118|00000000||Come with me, please. We've formalities to see to.
   1204120|00000000||I am right behind you.
   1204114|00000000||Miss, come with me, please? We've formalities to attend to.
   1204116|00000000||Of course.
   1204098|00000000||More or less agreed already…
   1204100|00000000||Excellent! You truly are a boon from the heavens.
   1204089|00000000||I'll help.
   1204090|00000000||Let's talk about my pay.
   1204096|00000000||Can do it, but not for free.
    477733|3fbb3904||Nilfgaardian Officer
   1165466|00000000||You're a right dishy piece of-- Urgh. I'm going to spew.
   1165468|00000000||Blrghfgh… Blech… Ptooey.
   1193384|00000000||That tipple of yours, Geralt… Fan-fuffing-tastic!
   1165472|00000000||Were wine from poopoo pressed, its wondrous flavor would still be best. Heehee.
   1165470|00000000||Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum, your old man is your mum! Teeheehee.

   1211435|00000000||[PL] Szkielet
   1193600|00000000||Dreadfully sorry.
   1193602|00000000||Those were the days…
   1188713|00000000||I've always dreamt of traveling to the North…
   1188711|00000000||I imagine you've been all over the world, Sir Witcher.
   1188717|00000000||What's new in the North?
   1188715|00000000||Have you seen the Skellige Isles?
   1082184|dc56af09||Bandit Leader
   1214232|00000000||The Duchy of Toussaint is the homeland of wine and knights errant. And just like grapes need the sun to ripen, so do knights errant need a certain amount of encouragement to complete their missions. Geralt, while not a knight and not really known to be errant, decided nevertheless to jump into one's boots and try to earn a few coppers.<br>
   1214233|00000000||Who would have thought that, in a land flowing with milk and honey, Geralt would happen across a settlement in desperate and urgent need of a witcher's blade! Luckily our hero always kept his at the ready and soon managed to rescue at least a dozen people. Afterwards... he gave it some thought and concluded there might be someone around willing to pay him for his trouble.<br>
   1214234|00000000||Who would have thought that, in a land flowing with milk and honey, Geralt would happen across a knight in desperate and urgent need of a witcher's blade! Luckily our hero always kept his at the ready and soon managed to rescue the poor man. Afterwards... he gave it some thought and concluded there might be someone around willing to pay him for his trouble.<br>
   1214235|00000000||Who would have thought that, in a land flowing with milk and honey, Geralt would happen across a person in desperate and urgent need of a witcher's blade! Luckily our hero always kept his at the ready and soon managed to rescue the merchant. Afterwards... he gave it some thought and concluded there might be someone around willing to pay him for his trouble.<br>
   1214236|00000000||Who would have thought that, in a land flowing with milk and honey, Geralt would happen across the lair of a group of ruthless, cold-blooded bandits. Luckily our hero always kept his steel sword at the ready and soon had dispatched this "hanse" of dangerous delinquents. Afterwards... he gave it some thought and concluded there might be someone around willing to pay him for his trouble.<br>
   1214237|00000000||Geralt completed all the contracts the camerlengo had to offer him. The reward he received was not quite what he had expected, true, but valuable all the same.
   1214401|00000000||Geralt came across an altogether typical looking notice  – someone was looking for the help of knights or other "strongmen." He concluded he met the above-stated requirements and set off for Knights Dormant Square to meet with the ducal camerlengo.<br>
   1214416|00000000||Geralt's efforts would in fact not go unrewarded. He found a contract on a notice board in which the ducal camerlengo promised a reward for the help of "knights or other strongmen." The witcher concluded he met the above-stated requirements and set off for Knights Dormant Square to meet with the ducal camerlengo.<br>
   1214242|00000000||Complete the contracts you took on from the camerlengo.
   1214240|00000000||[Optional] Go see the ducal camerlengo to collect your pay.
   1214241|00000000||Go see the ducal camerlengo about your reward for fulfilling the contracts.
   1214274|00000000||Go see the ducal camerlengo about your pay.
   1214402|00000000||See if there is anything on the notice boards about a contract for helping out around the region.
   1214415|00000000||Check the notice board for a contract for helping out around the region.
   1214426|00000000||Go to the ducal camerlengo to learn the details of the contract.

   1214198|00000000||Knight for Hire
   1031427|775f49f7||Shepherd
   1157748|00000000||Dettlaff van der Eretein, you do not know us, but we know you… to be a vampire. We know also of your weakness for the wench they call Rhenawedd.
   1187852|00000000||Now you know this. We shall chain her down and let rats feed on her. We shall flay the skin from her flesh… Yet you can save her. You need but travel to Beauclair, where you shall slay five men in the manner we prescribe.
   1187854|00000000||You must complete the killing in three days. Fail, and the next letter you receive will contain a memento of your failure - your beloved's finger.
   1157750|00000000||There you have it. Proof positive Dettlaff killed not of his own accord. A blackmailer's sunk his claws into him.
   1160543|00000000||Blackmailer - any idea who it could be?
   1160545|00000000||Any idea what it could be? Dettlaff have any enemies?
   1160547|00000000||Indeed, Dettlaff gains foes occasionally, but they never live long.
   1161003|00000000||One might've managed to evade him.
   1161005|00000000||Possible in theory… but I know of none. It would have to be someone devilishly dangerous. As you well know, having faced Dettlaff yourself.
   1161007|00000000||Whoever it is, it is someone new.
   1160542|00000000||Who's Rhenawedd?
   1170038|00000000||Why'd he believe she'd gone missing?
   1170055|00000000||Why'd he think that? Any signs or clues to that effect?
   1170057|00000000||None to be found. Apparently she disappeared one day. Her belongings disappeared with her. Not a scenario one associates with kidnapping. In my humble opinion, she left on her own, scared off, perhaps, by a bout of Dettlaff's rage that revealed his other, more monstrous side.
   1161332|00000000||Untrue.
   1161253|00000000||Not how I'd put it. Doubt it's how the duchess will see it, either.
   1161255|00000000||I trust you to convince her. And then…
   1161257|00000000||What? Go on, don't be shy. See you've got all figured out. Including the grin I gotta wear.
   1161259|00000000||It's a rather bold plan, but… were we to find Rhenawedd, we would strip the blackmailers of their hold on Dettlaff.
   1161261|00000000||That's one idea…
   1161341|00000000||Hm. Could be worth a shot, but… what about Dettlaff? He gonna go on killing while I'm out searching for his lover?
   1161343|00000000||He will not. I shall convince him to stay his hand, assure him you're a friend seeking to help. I'll await him here - he's sure to return sooner or later.
   1161265|00000000||Think he'll listen?
   1161267|00000000||He will.
   1190131|00000000||Oughta wait with you, maybe.
   1190133|00000000||No. He'll sense you from a mile off, simply fail to appear. I'd better stay alone, you must trust me on this.
   1161345|00000000||Fine. Need to report to the duchess, first.
   1161347|00000000||So be it. We'll await you here. Dettlaff and I both.
   1161336|00000000||Actually, it is. Dettlaff's being manipulated. Some lunatic's turned him into a tool, making him kill.
   1161338|00000000||So it would seem… But this illuminates a path of action for us. We must find Rhenawedd, render the blackmail senseless. The lunatic or tics will thus lose hold on Dettlaff.
   1161331|00000000||True.
   1161191|00000000||Let's sum up what we know.
   1161245|00000000||Seems Dettlaff's being blackmailed. Someone's been feeding him his victims' names.
   1161247|00000000||All noted down using one and the same Nazairi ink. And not in his handwriting.
   1161249|00000000||Not much…
   1161251|00000000||But enough to ascertain Dettlaff's innocence. Clearly.
   1161227|00000000||Let's sum up what we know.
   1161308|00000000||Blackmailer, curious about him.
   1161310|00000000||Blackmailer - kinda curious who it could be…
   1161312|00000000||Why is that?
   1161314|00000000||Regis… Somebody kidnapped a vampire's lover - bold to begin with. Now they're forcing the vampire to kill, a vampire you yourself insist is no murderer. Blackmailer's skilled, someone special.
   1161316|00000000||Hm. Astute. Now that I think of it, I'm beginning to wonder if…
   1161318|00000000||It's not one of your kind? Another vampire?
   1170067|00000000||Precisely. The plot thickens.
   1170069|00000000||Just a hypothesis. Wouldn't set my heart on it till we know more.
   1170071|00000000||Right you are.
   1160517|00000000||Look, slips of paper, name on each…
   1157744|00000000||Count Crespi, Count du Lac, Milton de Peyrac-Peyran, Count de la Croix…
   1157746|00000000||Dettlaff's victims, one and all. But that's not his hand.
   1161184|00000000||Must've come from whoever wrote the letter.
   1160519|00000000||All of it written using the same ink.
   1160998|00000000||See the color? Ink was dyed with cinnabarite. Rare mineral, pretty much found only in…
   1161000|00000000||Nazair. But I fear it means very little - anyone could have imported such ink.
   1161002|00000000||Fair enough. Still worth remembering.
   1161180|00000000||Look, this slip is stained.
   1160521|00000000||With wine. Not much to go on, either - especially not in Beauclair.
   1161188|00000000||Perhaps… Yet perhaps also worth remembering.
   1161196|00000000||Dettlaff could've written all that.
   1161198|00000000||Dettlaff's handwriting - seen many samples?
   1161200|00000000||A handful. But mind telling me why you ask?
   1161202|00000000||Listen, I know you wanna believe he's somehow not responsible, but maybe you're just wrong. Could be he himself wrote those names out, stained that slip with wine…
   1161206|00000000||No, Geralt. I know him. In a fit of rage, out of passion - I could believe he could kill. But murder, a series, no less, planned out? It's simply not him.
   1161208|00000000||A hideout in the city, learning his victim's habits, noting down their names… No. Someone is controlling him. Of this I am certain.
   1161210|00000000||Right, so someone's blackmailing him - we know that. Still have no idea who. Need to look around some more.
   1161193|00000000||Still got nothing, basically. Need to look around some more.
   1161195|00000000||Let's get to work.
   1161189|00000000||Need more clues. Keep looking.
   1161078|00000000||Even if Rhenawedd did abandon him that time, looks like someone's actually kidnapped her this time.
   1161080|00000000||Hard to argue with that. And hard to foresee what he's prepared to do to free her, get her back.
   1160416|00000000||He's prepared to kill, that's clear.
   1157752|00000000||As would you be for Yennefer. He kills for he cares for her deeply, and that blood, those individuals… they mean nothing to him.
   1161069|00000000||Yeah, I get it now. He's out to rescue a female from his pack.
   1161082|00000000||Exactly.
   1161075|00000000||Looks like somebody actually kidnapped her this time.
   1161076|00000000||Dettlaff ever try to look for her?
   1170059|00000000||Dettlaff ever try to find her? I mean, if she was that important…
   1170061|00000000||Higher vampires have their ways. All kinds. Should've been easy as pie for him.
   1170063|00000000||Geralt, as you rightly noted, we are vampires, not miracle workers.
   1170065|00000000||He searched, for months on end before giving up. Clearly Rhenawedd knew him all too well, enough to cover her tracks, leave no way for him to find her.
   1170046|00000000||Dettlaff have trouble letting go, accepting that she'd left him?
   1170048|00000000||Is that so hard to believe? Do you know no humans who've struggled with just such a thing? And Dettlaff is so much more emotional than most humans.
   1170050|00000000||Not only was she his beloved, his lover, his mate. She was a member of his pack. And one never leaves one's pack voluntarily.
   1170040|00000000||Take it you have your doubts.
   1170042|00000000||I know humans better than he does. Their capacity to be disloyal, dishonest. I also know she took her things - not something one associates with the kidnapped or those who disappear against their will.
   1170044|00000000||I'll save you the trouble of asking - no, I don't know why she left. I can, however, hazard a guess that Dettlaff grew angry one day, showed another, more monstrous side. Dettlaff's anger could frighten anyone off, though most who see it get no chance to flee.
   1170037|00000000||What do you think happened to her?
   1160404|00000000||Who's Rhenawedd?
   1160406|00000000||His one-time lover. The sole human woman with whom he was very close.
   1170028|00000000||Because she accepted him. With her aid and care, he found a place for himself in this hostile world. She began the work that I strive to continue.
   1160408|00000000||Ever meet her?
   1160410|00000000||Never had the pleasure, alas. She deserted him a time before he came round to save me. Though he always claimed she'd gone missing.
   1097355|00000000||Subjects aplenty for ballads all around, they said! Lying there for the taking. But I never believed it!
   1097359|00000000||Witcher, whoa there! Come here, be nimble, be quick!
   1097357|00000000||Le Papillon, you lucky scoundrel!
   1194720|00000000||Prrrrr…
   1194722|00000000||Hey, darlin'. Like what you see?
   1194724|00000000||Hey, handsome!
   1194726|00000000||Ha-aw ekh ekh…
   1178129|00000000||Hm… yes?
   1178131|00000000||Hungry? Thirsty?
   1178135|00000000||I married a dopey dullard. Mother said he was, I should have listened…
   1178133|00000000||You lads are all the same!
   1175680|00000000||Somebody, help! Good folk!
   1175684|00000000||Whoa, there, swift swashbuckler!
   1175682|00000000||Greetings. Greetings!
   1198266|00000000||Eeny, meeny, miny, meastie! The witcher killed the big bad beastie!
   1198885|00000000||Thank you for the rescue, witcher!
   1175688|00000000||When fancy's darts fly clear of hearts, folk had best try a little lovage!
   1175686|00000000||It is now thought the very height of la mood to dine on goose livers pickled, then stewed! Hoohoohoo…!
   1175690|00000000||Watch out! I bite! Hahaha!
   1077334|e6179154||Madame
   1086251|00000000||Peasant
   1188921|00000000||My dear… you're married, but what difference does it make…? Life's to be lived, for we live but once…
   1193311|00000000||Mhm. Once. So if folk come to consider me a cocotte, it's a label I'll not ever be rid of.
   1193313|00000000||No one will know.. Only I, you and the moon…
   1193315|00000000||That's what they all say. Until a mate buys them a beer, and they brag all about what and how they did with who in which barn!
   1193317|00000000||Ehh… You've not an ounce of romance in you.
   1207745|00000000||Attack! Aaaa-ttaaaaack!
   1190372|00000000||Attack! Aaaa-ttaaaaack!
   1198435|00000000||Thank you, friend - for saving my enchained knightly bum!
   1198433|00000000||Blunder me blind. I would be gone if not for your aid, comrade!
   1207743|00000000||I shall never retreat, not one step!
   1190354|00000000||I shall never retreat, not one step!
   1190358|00000000||Friend…
   1190356|00000000||Enough of that! Behave!
   1198429|00000000||May our dear Duchess Anna Henrietta's spirit rest in peace.
   1198431|00000000||Duchess Anna Henrietta's death has made orphans of us all.
   1190360|00000000||It is right and fitting, witcher, that the duquessa summoned, and you came!
   1190362|00000000||By my troth! It is the witcher who saved us from woe!
   1198427|00000000||By my troth! It is the witcher who saved us from woe!
   1190368|00000000||You let us all down, witcher!
   1190366|00000000||Swish-swash! Swish-swash!
   1190370|00000000||Leaping Lebioda's wounds!
   1207739|00000000||You let us all down, witcher!
   1207735|00000000||Lebioda's weeping wounds!
   1207741|00000000||The lust to do evil… I'll beat it out of you!
   1207737|00000000||Rack-a-thwack! Rack-a-thwack!
   1190364|00000000||The lust to do evil… I'll beat it out of you!
   1190350|00000000||Welcome!
   1190352|00000000||Yes, my Lord?
    578008|6d7bcb65||Courtesan
    170811|72cb8ee5||Drowner
   1191578|00000000||Yaaaawn… Yes?
   1191580|00000000||Do you like it here?
   1189739|00000000||If only I had the coin for a medic…
   1189737|00000000||Those noises, again… I couldn't sleep a wink.
   1189743|00000000||Yaaaaawn…
   1189741|00000000||Ehh, just let me rest.
   1176923|00000000||What is this place?
   1176958|00000000||What is this place? Poor house?
   1176960|00000000||You could call it that. They come here to rest and eat a hot meal.
   1187627|00000000||You help 'em why?
   1187629|00000000||Because they need help.
   1185894|00000000||All right… I can take a hint. Come, time to go.
   1185918|00000000||Are you well, my friend?
   1185920|00000000||Wha… what happened?
   1185922|00000000||Well, I saw your opponents gain the upper hand, so I took the liberty of jumping in. They shan't bother us anymore. We can now have a calm conversation with the proprietor.
   1177558|00000000||I thank you much for your aid… I tried to reason with them, but they'd have beat me blue had you not come along. I'm grateful, immensely.
   1185616|00000000||What'd they want from you?
   1185614|00000000||They are neighbors, wish me to take my folk, the shelter, elsewhere. They dislike that I help the beggars.
   1185629|00000000||I do not oppose going elsewhere were we to have somewhere to go. But you've come with a problem, have you? My turn to aid you.
   1176922|00000000||Need some information.
   1176962|00000000||Need some information. Looking for a man who might've mentioned the bootblack in Rue de Garles.
   1176972|00000000||The bootblack? A feisty lad, I know him…
   1176974|00000000||Any of your… uh, wards supposed to meet him recently or soon?
   1176993|00000000||Forgive me, those I help and I are not so close that I would know. But should you wait, they'll all soon come for their meal.
   1184064|00000000||You can question them yourselves.
   1184043|00000000||All the beggars'll be here?
   1184045|00000000||Sure all your usual beggars'll be here?
   1184047|00000000||They're not obliged to come, of course. But they rarely find a decent meal elsewhere. So almost all in the area eat here.
   1184042|00000000||Thanks, we'll wait.
   1184059|00000000||Thanks. We'll wait. Nice of you to let us.
   1175966|00000000||My dears, I've a matter to address before I serve the soup. These two gentlemen have some questions of you. Pay attention, answer in brief, for if you draw it out your soup will go cold. And we wouldn't want that, would we?
   1175968|00000000||Recently, four of you delivered sealed letters to the bootblack… I know this.
   1187554|00000000||Does anyone know what the gentleman means? Go on, speak up. Romain?
   1175970|00000000||Why should I squeal? We were all told not to mention the letters. We all swore.
   1177028|00000000||You can tell me, Romain. You were given a letter and you delivered it, right? Good work, Romain. Thank you. Who else?
   1175979|00000000||I got one, too. Gave it to the bootblack. And Freshy, he got one. But he can't tell you as he's not here.
   1175981|00000000||I still have mine. I'm to deliver it two days after the Feast of Saint Barnabas.
   1177036|00000000||Letter's meaningless now.
   1185765|00000000||I need the letter. It's very important. It's no use to you anymore.
   1176054|00000000||Let's go. Haven't had a drink in weeks. Besides, doubt that information'd do the duchess any good.
   1192668|00000000||Heh. Why not admit you're simply afraid of her reaction?
   1192671|00000000||She already locked me up once. Can you blame me?
   1177003|00000000||I cannot. At times one must abandon grand politics for a bit of simple pleasure. I believe this is one of those times.
   1176996|00000000||Let's go drink.
   1167899|00000000||Yes, yes and yes. All seem likely. And none are mutually exclusive. But if you'd like to know for certain, you could always ask her yourself.
   1186144|00000000||Think it's a good idea?
   1186151|00000000||Think it's a good idea? After all, we foiled her carefully planned scheme. Think she'll even want to--?
   1186153|00000000||…Talk to you? Would it harm you in any way to try?
   1186178|00000000||Some philosophers think empirical examination the sole path to knowledge.
   1186174|00000000||Actually love to learn her motives.
   1186176|00000000||Praiseworthy, I suppose. Sometimes one should stare evil in the face.
   1187557|00000000||Seems a bit strong. No?
   1187559|00000000||She used my friend as her tool for killing. I believe I've every right to condemn her. But I support your lust for the truth.
   1186142|00000000||Love to learn her motives.
   1159396|00000000||Hoped I wouldn't have to see her again, ever.
   1159465|00000000||What can I say? The road to truth is oft muddy, rutted and largely unpleasant.
   1159521|00000000||Just like the road to Oxenfurt, then.
   1159381|00000000||Thought I was done dealing with Syanna.
   1159380|00000000||I'd like to ask her.
   1159383|00000000||Actually, be happy to do that. To look her in the eyes and ask why she wanted to murder her own sister.
   1150637|00000000||I believe you mentioned the duchess keeps Syanna locked up?
   1159519|00000000||Courtiers were insisting on a harsher punishment, much harsher. Think Anna Henrietta had to protect her sister from a lynch mob as much as she wanted to protect her subjects from a criminal.
   1166221|00000000||One way or another, she's locked away in a secluded wing of the palace, awaiting trial before a court of law. I'd need to get past some guards to see her.
   1150639|00000000||Coming with?
   1150641|00000000||Of course not. I shall await you at Mère-Lachaiselongue. I'll not risk entering the palace after Dettlaff and his minions' rampage.
   1177005|00000000||Besides, I vastly prefer the company of a simple mug of mandrake brew to that of the duchess' vile sister.
   1166223|00000000||So, said straight up it means you're going off to get drunk because you hate Syanna.
   1166225|00000000||I've never been fond of categorical statements of that kind. But I admit I could not vouch for my behavior in her presence.
   1166227|00000000||She treated Dettlaff cruelly, caused his death in the end. And now this…? Atop all that? No, Geralt. I will not go with you. I will await you at the cemetery.
   1166232|00000000||Coming with?
   1166233|00000000||Meet after the ceremony?
   1166285|00000000||So, meet up once it's over? Assuming you'd rather not see Syanna again…
   1166289|00000000||You assume correctly. I shall await you at Mère-Lachaiselongue, with a hot mug of mandrake brew to keep me company.
   1176066|00000000||Ehh, think this might be something Anna Henrietta should now.
   1176068|00000000||As you wish. I shall await you at Mère-Lachaiselongue, a mug of mandrake brew to keep me company.
   1176070|00000000||Not coming with?
   1176999|00000000||No. After the horror Dettlaff brought down upon the city - and in light of Syanna's death - I think it wiser not to appear at the palace.
   1177001|00000000||Probably right. See you later, then.
   1192673|00000000||Before heading to the palace, you might wish to see if Anna Henrietta is not at the city cemetery. She's spent a great deal of time at her sister's grave these last days.
   1176997|00000000||Need to inform Anna Henrietta.
   1167913|00000000||What do we do now?
   1167918|00000000||Now we drink. Unless, that is, you feel a witcherly duty to see the duchess and tell her what we just learned.
   1167906|00000000||What now?
   1167907|00000000||Duchess is safe now, luckily.
   1167924|00000000||Can only guess what drove Syanna. Luckily Anna Henrietta's safe now.
   1167926|00000000||I believe we may dare to assume so. Syanna's death was also the death of the duquessa's only natural rival. She is in no danger, for now.
   1167944|00000000||Pretty rare thing for a ruler.
   1167315|00000000||Yes, yes and yes. All those make sense. And none are mutually exclusive.
   1159143|00000000||Duchess was to be Dettlaff's last victim… Syanna planned it from the start.
   1159302|00000000||Indeed. The logical conclusion, Geralt.
   1159304|00000000||Four seemingly random victims to start, the Virtues their only link. Enough to get folk talking about a righteous, vengeful Beast…
   1166249|00000000||Obscured the victims' links to Syanna. Even as she had those she despised killed off one by one… leaving the duchess for last.
   1159335|00000000||Had she managed to fulfill her plan, none would have questioned the reasons, most would have thought Anna Henrietta had died for her sins.
   1176995|00000000||She was known to show a hard heart on many occasions. Ample proof of a lack of compassion.
   1159306|00000000||Why would Syanna murder her own sister? Out of envy? To take power? From an inborn penchant for evil?
   1159138|00000000||Last victim - the duchess.
   1159139|00000000||Complete the puzzle for you?
   1159141|00000000||Puzzle complete now?
   1159311|00000000||Alas, the matter's ceased to be a tantalizing brainteaser and has turned incredibly grave. We've proof of a plot to assassinate Toussaint's ruler, we've proof of a coup d'état.
   1150619|00000000||Dammit.
   1150621|00000000||What is it? Another name, truly?
   1159044|00000000||See for yourself.
   1159047|00000000||Well, well… I… I must say even I did not expect this…
   1196424|00000000||"This time you will see to our duquessa." It seems we underestimated Syanna rather grossly.
   1184007|00000000||Judging by this, Dettlaff was literally supposed to tear her heart out…
   1196426|00000000||"Yet first you must snap her neck." Puzzling.
   1185830|00000000||But I was to deliver it personally, let no one else see it. That is what she said. And she was frightening.
   1185832|00000000||You ought to heed folk who are kind and honest. These men helped me a short while ago, helped all of us. If this individual threatened you, you need not keep the promise you made.
   1185834|00000000||All right… Take it. I didn't want to see the bootblack anyways. It's always muddy there…
   1177042|00000000||It's a matter of importance to the duchy. Hand it over. Or I'll take it from you, plain and simple.
   1177037|00000000||Give me that letter.
   1190853|00000000||Stay out of trouble and we'll be dandy.
   1190861|00000000||You're a hero now. A savior! Mhmhmhmh.…
   1190863|00000000||Heheh, you asked for it.
   1190865|00000000||May you shit in your coffin…
   1190867|00000000||Now, be a good lad. Put that back in its scabbard. Go on, I'll wait.
   1190869|00000000||Hey! You! I'm talkin' to you, grayboy!
   1190871|00000000||Mh. That's right.
   1190873|00000000||Bloody hell…
   1200926|00000000||Place mentioned in the note. Archespore saplings are somewhere around here.
   1200946|00000000||Letter proves Count Crespi's behind the sabotage at both vineyards. Gotta tell Matilda and Liam.
   1202721|00000000||Letter suggests a third party's behind the troubles at Liam's and Matilda's vineyards. Still don't know who, though. And I'm no longer likely to find out. Dammit.
   1202719|00000000||Apparently someone's sabotaging operations at Vermentino. But the letter doesn't say who. Hm. Need to keep looking. Could still find out.
   1200932|00000000||Hm, a letter and a key. In a place like this? Oughta be interesting.
   1200936|00000000||Hm. What've we got here? No chance this letter wound up here by accident.
   1200934|00000000||Interesting… This note plus what I found earlier - some third party's causing problems at the vineyards.
   1202761|00000000||Need to find the spot the letter mentions. Bet I'll find something mighty interesting behind whatever door this key opens.
   1206065|00000000||Ducal clerk's looking for help. Could be good coin to be made.
   1206130|00000000||The steward told me you dispatched those belly-aching suppliers handily… Good work.
   1206132|00000000||Thank you. I never thought I'd hear praise from your lips… Usually you find fault in everything I do.
   1206363|00000000||I don't find fault, I am merely honest. As I am now - you did well.
   1206150|00000000||Hmm… Looks like an archespore killed him. Should search the body.
   1206157|00000000||Archespore saplings? Takes a degenerate to cultivate something like this.
   1210090|00000000||Need to incinerate them. Before they spew spores and spread.
   1213547|00000000||Hmm… Looks like an archespore killed him.
   1200938|00000000||Note's clear - someone's out to sabotage Coronata. Shame I don't know who… though I could still find out if I keep looking.
   1200950|00000000||I'm counting on you, witcher.
   1201042|00000000||Please, sir. Do not disturb.
   1200944|00000000||You will help me, won't you?
   1200956|00000000||Come now, madame, monsieur. We shall never get anywhere in this manner…
   1200958|00000000||I care about one thing only - acquiring Belgaard. I will make an infinitely better steward than she will. A pretty face is hardly enough if the head it adorns is empty.
   1200960|00000000||Says the most foppish philanderer of the southern reaches! You'd do better to tend to your vineyard and look less to the grape-stomping lasses.
   1200930|00000000||Please don't bother me. I'm busy.
   1197657|00000000||We shall never forget what you did for us. Our grandchildren will drink your health!
   1200964|00000000||Clear my vineyard, please. It's very important.
   1197646|00000000||I thank you again. And hope the wine's to your liking.
   1200962|00000000||Until you solve all Coronata's problems, I am deep in the cesspool.
   1211171|00000000||Problems Liam de Coronata mentioned - must've been talking about this…
   1211173|00000000||Matilda Vermentino must've meant this when she mentioned troubles…
   1211293|00000000||Well, well. Seems the saboteur came around here, too.
   1177576|00000000||Is it a drink you seek?
   1177574|00000000||Greetings!
   1198270|00000000||Drink, mes amis, eat, drink and make merry! We are no longer in any danger!
   1177580|00000000||Drink, mes amis, eat, drink and make merry! For tomorrow the Beast will devour us all!
   1198268|00000000||Our beloved duquessa…
   1177578|00000000||White-haired witcher… I've seen that dome before, but where?!
   1177582|00000000||Careful, friend!
   1177584|00000000||The Guard! Summon the Guard!
    461008|c85134b5||Katakan
   1194502|00000000||Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-what now?
   1194504|00000000||L-l-l-let me live.
   1156209|00000000||Whoa! A witcher! A serious client, at last! Tell me, what do you need? Honeysuckle? Ginatia petals?
   1156216|00000000||Show me what you've got in stock.
   1156212|00000000||What do you have on offer?
   1188504|00000000||In the mood for a round of gwent?
   1188502|00000000||How about a game of gwent?
   1156282|00000000||Need to get going. Till next time.
   1156214|00000000||Need to get going.
   1156213|00000000||Business all right?
   1156218|00000000||How's business?
   1156220|00000000||The coin is good, but… just between us, I'm going batty with boredom.
   1182192|00000000||I know what my customers want before they open their mouths. Bald men - birch sap. Ladies of all walks - whatever fragrance Duchess Anarietta prefers at the time.
   1182194|00000000||If just once somebody would order some poison… ehh.
   1156211|00000000||Welcome back, master!
   1179088|00000000||Ptooey! Let's ride!
   1195558|00000000||Light the signal fire! Now, cor blimey!
   1179090|00000000||Ngh! Take a pecker to the back!
   1179092|00000000||Why you nimble muffrucker…
   1179086|00000000||Ehh, tittlenicks!
   1179094|00000000||This shan't drag on too long!
   1179096|00000000||Slice! Cut! Kill!
   1179098|00000000||A life for a life.
   1179100|00000000||What the cuttledickens…?
   1205387|061a8de3||Mug
   1188823|00000000||Witchman!
   1188821|00000000||Oh.
   1200661|00000000||Can you fathom it? Vermentino and Coronata reconciled?
   1188825|00000000||Me oh my! A witchfeller!
   1188827|00000000||Durned-diddly, my gammy leg aches something fierce.
   1115654|00000000||You're back? Here to clear up the mystery of the cow after all?
   1115609|00000000||Don't have time for this now.
   1116706|00000000||Talk some other time, maybe. So long.
   1155990|00000000||We're to miss yet another milestone…? How am I to tell the investor?
   1200282|00000000||Helped you finish the statue like you asked.
   1200284|00000000||Master, what would I have done without you? Countless throngs of Lebioda's followers will praise in prayer.
   1200286|00000000||And you'll pay me, right?
   1200288|00000000||But of course, your reward. The investor is a serious man of enterprise. Our plan foresee mass conversions. With the donations that will follow, we aim to recoup the costs of production in three to five years. Everything has been calculated, you see, down to the last decimal.
   1200290|00000000||Hm, good luck, then. Farewell.
   1115630|00000000||Zoot, we must get back to work soon, immediately, or our plan's worth a dog's runny turd.
   1204771|00000000||So, master, the workers who vanished - how goes the search?
   1115632|00000000||Well? Have you learned how that cow came to fly?
   1122898|00000000||Fine. But that is the sum total - no bonuses or gratuities on top, understood?
   1201558|00000000||That accident - anyone witness it?
   1201612|00000000||Need to know more about this accident. Anyone actually see what happened?
   1201614|00000000||No, but sounds there were. Austerve had just gone to see how Emil was getting along when suddenly we heard an ear-botching boom. Moments later, something smashed into one of the cranes.
   1201616|00000000||Doubt it was the cow that hit the crane.
   1201618|00000000||Probably true. At any rate, come morn we ventured out to see, but the vermin drove us off. With that, all work came to a halt, has remained so since.
   1201915|00000000||Master, tarry no longer, please. Will you take on the matter?
   1115628|00000000||Yes, an unfortunate matter, indeed, to be crushed by a cow… A true shame, Emil - he was a good worker.
   1149534|00000000||I told them at once there had to be a simple explanation. But that lot, no - right away they started in screaming "plague," demanding higher wages for "hardship," "poor working conditions," you see…? They'll ruin me, the blotters.
   1149554|00000000||Mh. My job… is to figure out why a cow fell from the sky? That it?
   1187233|00000000||That, too. The thing is, since none bothered to clear the cow corpse, some filth's overrun the other pit. We fear to venture there.
   1123545|00000000||Necrophages, I know. Already tended to them. Saw the cow and Emil, too, but I need to take a closer look.
   1136778|00000000||Yes, master, that you must. This riddle needs unraveling.
   1123548|00000000||Not surprised. Cow - where'd it come from, what kind was it?
   1136784|00000000||Why, the ordinary spotted kind. Nothing unusual. Its corpse rots in the other pit, sends out its stench. And Emil lies right beneath it. Will you tend to the matter, take on the contract?
   1168994|00000000||What exactly are you doing here?
   1169498|00000000||What exactly's going on here?
   1169500|00000000||Construction of a statue of the Prophet Lebioda. We're carving it. Not all at once, that is, but piece by piece. A pious investor's revived the project after years of neglect. He's engaged all nearby quarries in its completion.
   1169506|00000000||And we would be on schedule were it not for the incident! Please, master… will you look into it?
   1136754|00000000||Fine. I'll look into it. Might be a botched portal, but I doubt it.
   1136756|00000000||Lebioda reward you with progeny aplenty. I shall keep an eye out for your return.
   1115607|00000000||I'll look into it.
   1204788|00000000||They vanished? What's that mean?
   1171211|00000000||Just that, along with ample supplies. I had placed an order. More than a dozen wagons reached the building site, yet five were lost along the way.
   1199399|00000000||Tools, food, building materials and, first and foremost, the specailists we need, the chief architect included.
   1199401|00000000||I wrote to the architect to say the quarry awaits, he should send new plans. But the foreman said the architect was here, at Ardaiso. And this means…
   1199403|00000000||He's missing too. Got it. I'll look around, see what I can learn.
   1199405|00000000||Master, I know not how to thank you. But I beg you to hurry. We shall simply not finish without those five wagons.
   1204786|00000000||Vanished - what's that mean?
   1200499|00000000||Helped you finish the statue.
   1186389|00000000||Beasts shouldn't cause you any more trouble.
   1204767|00000000||Why, that is grand news!
   1155339|00000000||Here, take this. And I thank you, master!
   1186391|00000000||Probably heard the last of the beasts. Burned the nest, eggs, everything.
   1204769|00000000||A praiseworthy precaution, but as I said, I can only pay you what we agreed. I simply haven't any more.
   1115634|00000000||Yeah. You can get back to work. And it wasn't a plague of falling cows.
   1115636|00000000||Did I not say so from the start? A weight off my chest! So what was behind the animal's plummet?
   1115638|00000000||Young slyzard flying over the quarry dropped it. Was trying to get it back to its nest - food for its mother and siblings.
   1115608|00000000||Yeah. Cleared everything up.
   1122868|00000000||My reward - let's talk.
   1122882|00000000||Need to talk about my reward before I decide.
   1122884|00000000||Ahh, time for a good haggle. So, how much would you take?
   1122886|00000000||What? You jest! We mine stone here, not gold!
   1122896|00000000||Hm, you must go lower for it to make any sense to me.
   1122916|00000000||No chance! You shall have what I offer or get out of my sight.
   1201620|00000000||Ah, master, the matter of the statue…? How fare things?
   1193722|99283639||Shaelmaar
   1186666|00000000||One thing - found a handkerchief in the water. Monogrammed "d.l.C." Mean anything to you?
   1186668|00000000||De la Croix?! It cannot be. Was it he the Beast slew?!
   1186670|00000000||Seems so. Knew him well?
   1186672|00000000||Long past. We were close friends, once, but our paths diverged. He was a man of extremes, standing by his companions no matter the odds, fighting his foes to the bitter end.
   1186674|00000000||Foes - he have a lot of them?
   1186676|00000000||He did, but I do not see what that has to do with the Beast. Ah, Geralt, you've struck a raw nerve. Memories of a time long past to which I'd rather not return now.
   1186678|00000000||I understand. We can talk later. Let's go to the tavern.
   1173726|00000000||Found a monogrammed handkerchief.
   1173725|00000000||Someone's watching us.
   1173742|00000000||Seems we've got ourselves an audience.
   1173902|00000000||You think this surprising? The locals will tell the children of children they do not have yet of the day a quartered corpse was pulled from the river.
   1205615|00000000||What now?
   1205617|00000000||This isn't the site of the murder, we know that. Current brought the body here. Corpse got caught in the nets. Guardsmen pulled it out, put it in a boat and took it somewhere.
   1205619|00000000||Need to find out where. I'd like to look at the corpse before it starts to decompose.
   1205621|00000000||The inn - its patrons must have seen the guardsmen, which direction they took. We should ask there.
   1208947|00000000||Guardsmen snipped these nets to untangle the body. Which must've been quartered or chopped up somehow, given how much blood there is.
   1208758|00000000||Body parts were put on a boat, taken somewhere. Need to find out where. I'd like to look at the corpse before it starts to decompose.
   1208760|00000000||The inn - its patrons must have seen the guardsmen, which direction they took. We should ask there.
   1205565|00000000||Look, a boat was launched here. Guardsmen must've loaded the body parts onto it, taken them somewhere.
   1205567|00000000||Need to find out where. I'd like to look at the corpse before it starts to decompose.
   1205597|00000000||The inn - its patrons must have seen the guardsmen, which direction they took. We should ask there.
   1196871|00000000||What now?
   1196873|00000000||We know this isn't the site of the murder. Current brought the body here. Corpse got caught in the nets. Guardsmen pulled it out, put it in a boat and took it somewhere.
   1197345|00000000||I'd like to look at it before it starts to decompose.
   1197347|00000000||The inn - its patrons must have seen the guardsmen, which direction they took. We should ask there.
   1208481|2d344557||Snack Vendor
   1161116|00000000||The witcher waited, till the time was true, then twirled, danced and spun - struck the monster right through!
   1161118|00000000||Like a beau who leaves after love's first spurt, so the witcher wooed the shaelmaar, then its foul heart hurt!
   1161120|00000000||Dodge, dive, flee, feint! His razor strikes belly! Shaelmaar's cries ring aloud, blood transforms into jelly!
   1161112|00000000||Our hero's struck deep by the shaelmaar's red claws! Soon the witcher shall perish in cavernous maws!
   1161110|00000000||Woe to us all if the monster's the victor! Then naught shall have come of valor and vigor!
   1161108|00000000||Drink up the ocean and set fire to the wood! For nothing in this struggle can come to any good!
   1161106|00000000||Out, out, brief flame! And thus the witcher's life was snuffed. All our hopes, alas, had turned to dust.
   1161432|00000000||Alas! Poor knightling! The beast heaved its foul girth,
   1161434|00000000||Let loose a roar and knocked him to earth!
   1190410|00000000||Then down came the witcher in one mighty bound, to give fight to the beast, its plans confound!
   1194365|00000000||Alas! Palmerin lies prostrate, he has breathed his last breath!
   1199064|00000000||Avenge him, witcher! Fight bravely, unto death!
   1199759|00000000||For honor! Onward!
   1199761|00000000||Gotta keep it down!
   1199763|00000000||Can only tell where we are when it hears us!
   1161114|00000000||The fate of the beast has been weighed by the gods! Soon the witcher shall triumph, against all odds!
   1191903|00000000||Eh?
   1191905|00000000||Ugh, oh! I think I'm gonna spew.
   1191907|00000000||Sir, what's that your wavin'?
   1191909|00000000||Run! Run! Everbody run!
   1176681|00000000||Ooh, it's the swordsman. Good to see you, here for a spiffing? Dirty boots are a stain on professional dignity, you know! Step on up!
   1201325|00000000||Geralt! I'm pleased you had a change of heart.
   1172686|00000000||The young master and I were just discussing the curious composition of the local soil.
   1176683|00000000||Ooh, it's the chap with the swords. Sir, you look like some beast ate you up, then spat you out. Are you here for a spiffing? Boots make the man, they say! Step on up!
   1185631|00000000||Not wearing boots just now, but guess I could pull a pair on.
   1176584|00000000||Remember what they looked like?
   1176614|00000000||Remember what they looked like?
   1176616|00000000||Of course! I've a mind like a steel trap, as I said. They were ragged, unshaved. Their clothes were tattered. As to their boots, well, I mentioned that already.
   1176552|00000000||Geralt, allow me to ask a question… Listen, lad. I'll be glad to mix another batch of that boot shine for you…
   1176554|00000000||But you must focus now and tell us all you know. Where can we find the beggars?
   1176556|00000000||Well, at the shelter, most like.
   1176558|00000000||Where's that?
   1176560|00000000||Everyone knows. It's just 'round the corner. Up those stairs, then right.
   1176574|00000000||Thanks, kid. For your trouble.
   1176596|00000000||Where'd they get the letters? They pick them up, get them from someone?
   1176602|00000000||I don't know. They'd come, hand me a letter and walk away. I asked no questions.
   1176583|00000000||Where'd the beggars get the letters from?
   1176518|00000000||Beggars… tell us more about them? How many were there?
   1176532|00000000||Why… four. One for each letter.
   1176534|00000000||Just four? Sure you didn't get a fifth?
   1187933|00000000||I can count, you know.
   1187935|00000000||Remember anything else? These beggars have anything in common?
   1176538|00000000||What? Come, now, each was different. Some had mismatched boots, others had no boots at all…
   1176540|00000000||Oh! I know! They all had no home!
   1176546|00000000||Kid, my patience is starting to run a little thin. Now think hard…
   1176515|00000000||Beggars - who were they?
   1176516|00000000||Why didn't you tell us before?
   1176520|00000000||Why didn't you tell us this before, when we first talked?
   1176522|00000000||You didn't ask about beggars, now did you?
   1176432|00000000||Man in the frock coat - you passed him some letters. Remember?
   1176434|00000000||Why, of course. I'm young, got a mind like a steel trap. But…
   1176468|00000000||If you're about to tell me this information'll cost me, forget it.
   1176523|00000000||How'd you get those letters?
   1176526|00000000||Beggars brought them.
   1176426|00000000||Letters you delivered - remember them?
   1176427|00000000||How's business?
   1176624|00000000||How's business?
   1176626|00000000||Well enough, I can't complain. Though it'd be even better were certain folk to sit down for a shine as they stood and chatted.
   1184801|00000000||You've made some nice improvements… I'm rather impressed, both pleasing to the eye and functional.
   1184803|00000000||Isn't it? And it's all thanks to you! The coin you gave me, I invested it all. Thanks again!
   1184805|00000000||You're welcome.
   1186639|00000000||Then I shall take advantage as well. A friend of mine used to say boots should be as clean as the souls that wear them.
   1186641|00000000||Clean boots - clean souls ! A fine slogan!
   1185633|00000000||Guess they could use a spit and polish.
   1172689|00000000||Need to ask you something.
   1172691|00000000||Yet again? Go on, then - I'm a proponent of free speech and will gladly tell you all I know. But why not get your boots shined while we jabber?
   1195380|00000000||Uh-huh?
   1195382|00000000||Argh!
   1195384|00000000||Eee-yaaah!
   1195386|00000000||Now you've a problem.
   1195388|00000000||Chicken?
    423608|d3f91a2c||Armorer
   1205748|00000000||Alms for the poor, sir…?
   1152468|00000000||Oh, bumbotch! They didn't like that!
   1153862|00000000||We should look inside. Remember Joss's words?
   1175467|00000000||Mhm. One bean lies out in the open, guarded by "three nobodies"… Yeah, could be it.
   1152466|00000000||Oh, the three little pigs' homes. You know the story, don't you? "Who's afraid of the big bad wolf…?"
   1153448|00000000||Looks like Big Bad's already blown down the houses of straw and sticks… Brick's the only one left.
   1212237|00000000||<i>Happened like this… A nasty rain caught me while I was out in the woods, so I thought to myself, “I’ll hide in some hollow, for gods’ forbid I get soaked through and catch a cold at my age. So I crawled into a cave. And there inside, something roars at me! Tore out of there so fast, wind had dried my coat by the time I got home.</i><br>Velis Stail, herbalist<br><br>
   1212238|00000000||No one knows exactly when the spriggan called “Grottore” first made its home in the caves at the foot of Mount Gorgon. Spriggans usually prefer isolated backwoods and rarely make dens in caverns.<br>Yet Grottore seemed to have taken a liking to “grottos,” giving rise to its nickname.<br>The monster was quite well-known among Beauclair knights, who often talked of it as a potential source of great glory. None were particularly eager to actually engage the monster in combat, however – none, that is, except for the young knight François.<br><br>
   1212239|00000000||Grottore proved to be a demanding foe. It possessed the ability to teleport, meaning it would appear directly in front of Geralt and mount a surprise attack, dealing strong blows that were impossible to parry. It used primeval magic to control tree roots, which would shoot from the ground on its command, dealing significant damage to any in their way.<br><br>It was resistant to the Aard Sign, but vulnerable to burning. Blows from a silver sword would do it harm, despite the bark-like hide covering it like armor.
   1212236|00000000||Grottore
   1171697|00000000||I'd say a wolf, but it has the eyes of a cat!
   1171695|00000000||Wine - the breakfast of champions!
   1193338|00000000||White Wolf! Our salvadore!
   1171699|00000000||A cockerel in your codpiece is worth two in the bush!
   1171701|00000000||A witcher I may not be, but I always find a bottle promptly!
   1157972|00000000||Dammit…
   1182165|00000000||Killer must still be here.
   1157980|00000000||Claw wounds. From five separate claws, spread of a small human hand.
   1157982|00000000||Footprints. Small, bare feet. Lead deeper into the cellar.
   1172258|00000000||Woman from the inn was wearing this coat.
   1185031|00000000||Hurled against the wall with great force.
   1185033|00000000||Used this to batter down the grate…
   1193732|00000000||Took a lot of strength to batter this down.
   1193734|00000000||Killed with a single blow.
   1193736|00000000||Massacred. By a vampire. Not an ekimmara, though. Or a fleder.
   1194000|00000000||Bruxa. Gotta be.
   1193738|00000000||Attacker had no trouble knocking over the cart.
   1193740|00000000||Busted ribs, blood from the ears - took a solid hit…
   1197650|00000000||Throat torn open by man-like jaws.
   1197652|00000000||Man-like except for long fangs.
   1193744|00000000||Need to hurry.
   1193730|00000000||Sounds of a fight. Have to hurry.
   1193933|00000000||In the cellar, gotta be…
   1196138|00000000||River muck. Carried the body in this cart.
   1196217|00000000||Need to hurry.
   1202280|00000000||Black Blood and Moon Dust - could be lifesavers.
   1185029|00000000||Fell down the stairs, broke his neck.
   1174957|00000000||Top quality goods! Only the best!
   1174955|00000000||Good day!
   1174961|00000000||You shan't find anything better in all Toussaint!
   1174959|00000000||I stock the larder of the duquessa herself!
   1198831|00000000||*Sniffs* Dingle a dog! It still stinks in here…
   1174963|00000000||Why you…!
   1174965|00000000||What the feck?!
   1198833|00000000||Ooph! *Sniffs* The stink had better not spread to my wine…
   1196973|00000000||You don't say…!
   1196975|00000000||Yeah, right!
   1184666|00000000||Friend! Looking for the best wine in Toussaint?! It's Geralt of Rivia - remember that name!
   1184668|00000000||Have you heard the tale of Liam and Matilda? Love conquers all, even in business!
   1184662|00000000||All the great poets drank! It's the very reason I cannot be rid of this thirst…
   1184664|00000000||Gaze long enough into an empty goblet, and the goblet's like to gaze back into you!
   1184676|00000000||I wager you could stand to toss back some wine.
   1184670|00000000||Hu-hu-hullo!
   1184672|00000000||You watch where you put those paws!
   1196969|00000000||You'll never guess who won the gwent tourney. The witcher - the very same the duchess summoned from the North!
   1196971|00000000||The Beauclair cemetery's haunted! Haunted, I say! Ghosts prance about, moaning, rattling their chains and dragging the living into graves!
   1196967|00000000||They say all sorts of things about that witcher… Apparently, he's friends with Viscount Julian… the duquessa's former, you know… fellow!
   1184674|00000000||Madman! He's a madman!
   1122824|00000000||While wandering around Toussaint, Geralt did not neglect his vocation and the true core of his existence, namely, pursuing and slaying monsters. Having found a notice on a notice board, posted by a merchant guild beset by some beast, the witcher decided to go to the appointed spot to learn about the details of the matter.<br>
   1173791|00000000||At his destination, Geralt found a ransacked camp. It looked as if it had been destroyed recently. He also happened on the bodies of two merchants. Their wounds had clearly been caused by a monster of ample size.<br>While combing the surrounding area, the witcher happened on Count Borhis di Salvaress, who claimed the monster Geralt was tracking was a silver basilisk - the last surviving specimen of the subspecies which also happened to be the count's wildly roaming pet, a pet the nobleman desperately wished the witcher would spare.<br>To make matters worse, it turned out this basilisk was also the quarry of a small company of Crinfrid Reavers.<br>
   1173792|00000000||Geralt decided he would not slay the basilisk.<br>The count in turn pledged to take more precautions toward safeguarding merchants passing through his pet's feeding range. He also promised that Geralt would acquire ingredients at special prices from herbalists he knew.<br>
   1173793|00000000||Geralt decided that the basilisk had to die. It mattered little that it might have been the last of its subspecies, for fundamentally it remained a dangerous beast. Count di  Salvaress was distraught. He threatened that the witcher would never see another reasonable price at the shops of the herbalists he knew.<br>
   1207192|00000000||Geralt decided that the basilisk had to die. He nonetheless refused to hunt it down straight away. By the time he returned, the basilisk had made mincemeat of the four Crinfrid Reavers.<br>
   1210010|00000000||While tracking the basilisk, Geralt found yet another corpse.<br>As things stood, it seemed a band of Crinfrid Reavers was also hunting the basilisk. They had taken  on a contract from a local guild and in their arrogance collected the fee in advance.<br>Yet  the mercenaries somehow took an immediate liking to Geralt, which I find hard to believe, as I am quite familiar with their type…<br>They offered to join forces with the witcher in fighting the beast and promised to share their reward with him once it was brought down.<br>
   1173776|00000000||Meet the merchants at the camp.
   1174398|00000000||Using your Witcher Senses, investigate the campsite.
   1174417|00000000||Find out more about the second victim.
   1174418|00000000||Use your Witcher Senses to follow the basilisk.
   1174419|00000000||Kill the basilisk with the Reavers' help.
   1180194|00000000||Find the basilisk's lair.
   1180193|00000000||Use your Witcher Senses to follow the sounds.

   1172932|00000000||Greetings, greetings…
   1172934|00000000||Lebioda's lesions - nothing but a collection of scars…
   1198493|00000000||Nothing will ever be the same again. Poor, poor duquessa…
   1172936|00000000||First they chug their wine, then they whack each other upside the head.
   1172938|00000000||Someone did a shoddy job stitching up that face…
   1172940|00000000||Have you soup for brains?
   1172942|00000000||Where are your manners?!
   1187242|00000000||You won't believe it! Reginald's statue… it's been crippled!
   1195598|00000000||What? What do you mean?!
   1195600|00000000||His stones… they've been stolen! And the thief's left no clue!
   1195626|00000000||I think I could spot him. I'd just look for a man with a strained codpiece.
   1196599|00000000||Oh my goodness!
   1196601|00000000||Yeees - akh akh - I heard the same.
   1196605|00000000||Akh akh. Rumor has it someone slew Count Salvaress' silver basilisk. When the count learned of it, he blew his lid, dropped dead before nightfall!
   1196607|00000000||Did you hear about the massacre at the last meeting of the historical society?! Devoured, all of them, by some elven - akh akh - statuary!
   1196603|00000000||Godfried Nork - akh akh - the famed charcutier… imprisoned! For poisoning Her Grace's court with rotten sausages!

   1184736|00000000||The tourney may know only one… akh! Champion! Akh!
   1184730|00000000||And the brave knights - akh - lunged - akh akh - at one another's throats… akh.
   1184732|00000000||Maybe I should mull a bit of wine? To soothe the throat…
   1184738|00000000||Spare a poor, innocent bard…
   1184740|00000000||Watch out! Akh akh!
   1178990|00000000||Black is the color of my true love's hair…

   1184028|00000000||Welcome, Sir Ravix, Toussaint's best sword-swinger!
   1153586|00000000||Craft something for me? Look, got this diagram…
   1153580|00000000||Craft something for me, would you?
   1188473|00000000||Know you're busy, but you up for a round of gwent?
   1188471|00000000||Care for a round or two of gwent?
   1153592|00000000||So long.
   1153582|00000000||So long.
   1153579|00000000||Show me what you got there.
   1153584|00000000||Let's see what you got in stock.
   1153576|00000000||Armor chromed, engraved or fluted! Whatever your heart's desire!
   1153578|00000000||You are Sir Geralt of Rivia, Bridge your crest? The tourney's victor? This is a great honor!

   1154373|00000000||Wait!
   1154375|00000000||Why?
   1154377|00000000||The stalk will sprout abruptly. Very abruptly. We must be careful.
   1154380|00000000||All right! Toss them!
   1154383|00000000||Agh… Something's always gotta go wr--
   1154390|00000000||The home stretch.
   1207100|00000000||Incredible…
   1207102|00000000||Admire the view later. First we must deal with…
   1207105|00000000||…him.
   1152584|00000000||Now, we must plant them by the path near Longlocks' tower… Then prepare to meet the giant.
   1152582|00000000||Right, this is the spot. Pull out the beans.
   1177070|00000000||This will be a good spot to plant the beans - once we have them all.
   1201852|00000000||While snooping about the cursed Trastamara Estate, Geralt happened on a strange, spoon-like key. Attached to it was a note.<br>
   1201853|00000000||The note labeled the strange spoon as the property of the Pheasantry, known far and wide to be the finest tavern in all the duchy of Toussaint.<br>
   1201854|00000000||The witcher decided to follow the lead and headed to the Pheasantry to see what he could find. Though the innkeep denied ever having seen the peculiar utensil, she did suggest that Geralt search the tavern's cellar. For it was there that the previous owner's documents were stowed.<br>
   1201855|00000000||In the cellar Geralt found some notes. These in turn stated the spoon was a key to the studio of a legendary elven cook. The studio supposedly lay hidden amidst the ruins of a temple to the goddess Danamebi in the Blessure Forest…<br>
   1201856|00000000||Geralt reached the temple ruins, descended into the cellar, and found the long-forgotten studio-kitchen of one Ra'mses Gor-Thon, where treasure was as plentiful as dust and cobwebs!<br>
   1201857|00000000||Read the note attached to the spoon.
   1201858|00000000||Ask the owner of the Pheasantry about the mysterious spoon.
   1201859|00000000||Search the Pheasantry's cellars.
   1201860|00000000||Read the notes found in the Pheasantry.
   1201861|00000000||Find Gor-Thon's studio and look for treasure.
   1201851|00000000||Spoontaneous Profits!
   1144323|00000000||Here in Beauclair, all's right and fair!
   1144349|00000000||Have your chit-chat with someone else.
   1144351|00000000||Begone from my sight.
   1144321|00000000||The duquessa's champion… Ptooey.
   1192751|00000000||Were I in your boots, I'd go far away. Your protectress is no longer around.
   1144325|00000000||We've got to go at him together! Together!
   1144331|00000000||I'll tear your legs from your bum!
   1144329|00000000||Mutant!
   1144333|00000000||Damned. wandering gray-haired pee-pee-licker!
   1144327|00000000||For Duchess Henrietta!
   1144335|00000000||Noooo!
   1144337|00000000||Think you can do whatever you please?!
   1144339|00000000||Understood!
   1144341|00000000||Sheathe that blade, you twit!
   1144343|00000000||Watch out! He's a witcher!
   1144345|00000000||I knew you for a scallywag from the start!
   1144347|00000000||That's better.
   1191179|00000000||Yes, kind sir?
   1194062|00000000||Greetings, sonny.
   1194064|00000000||Oh, if I was young...
   1194066|00000000||You're twisted!
   1068740|00348067||Dog
   1153479|00000000||Need something crafted. Could you do that?
   1152209|00000000||Could you craft something for me?
   1151804|00000000||Straggen - name's familiar. Ran into him a while back.
   1200461|00000000||What's this?! He must have been a horrible houndshagger. Decent folk don't bear that name.
   1200463|00000000||Can't say if that's true for all the Straggens, but this one sure wasn't decent. Met a bad end, too. Justly so.
   1200465|00000000||You carved up the knobcupper! I knew it!
   1200467|00000000||Druids did it for me, actually. Burned him alive.
   1200469|00000000||Oh, lovely, lovely!
   1151761|00000000||Guy named Straggen - ran across him already.
   1211250|00000000||Mind taking a glance at these diagrams?
   1211252|00000000||For you, witcher, I will take two!
   1211255|00000000||I regret to say only a grandmaster could decipher these scribblings. And a grandmaster I am not…
   1211248|00000000||Found some interesting diagrams…
   1151806|00000000||See you later.
   1151763|00000000||Farewell.
   1151762|00000000||Show me what you've got on offer.
   1151802|00000000||Show me what you have on offer, will you?
   1151800|00000000||Ha, the witcher we love to love! I hope you've gutted some particularly nasty nastiness since last we met… Ah, what am I saying - of course you have.
   1151798|00000000||Well, well… Starling Straggen of house Bum-Diddled Harlotsbrood has bit the dust. May he rest in pain and agony!
   1199615|00000000||You've earned yourself a steep price cut here, witcher.
   1199617|00000000||Witcher! A moment of your time, may I?
   1175166|00000000||Busy! Busy, busy, busy!
   1175164|00000000||I've no time.

   1175168|00000000||A witcher, pfff. They're smearing his hiney with honey. I don't know why…
   1183150|00000000||Ahoy - hiccup!
   1183152|00000000||Hiccup! Ehh…
   1183156|00000000||Rump-riding rosé! Hiccup! It always gives me - hic! - trouble!
   1183154|00000000||Diddle a dog… hic! These hiccups…
   1187753|00000000||To bury the murderous lass in in one crypt with the duchess - it's not decent!
   1187755|00000000||Murderer or no, she was the duchess' sister, shared her blood. She should lie with her kin.

   1127551|00000000||Hey! Well parried, that! And the riposte - yes!
   1127545|00000000||And I tell you, the Maestro'll always be top dog! Why, since old Raymond started pushing up daisies, no one's even challenged him!
   1170720|00000000||And no one ever will!
   1127553|00000000||When I chop, you'll be bumbopped!
   1209510|00000000||You either drink with us, or you're against us!
   1180850|00000000||What is he doing here…? Help!
   1180852|00000000||Too too too too mmm-hmm mmmhmm…
   1180856|00000000||{N'ees behéfth ne bhampair ne sas mallaich! Esse deireadh tadhail an-seo.} [Curses, vampires - I did not sign up for any of this! This is my last time here.]
   1180858|00000000||{An tus Bèist, thaë a’anval bhampair… Sluagh-diccette a Toussaint ealdor fion y altaich!} [First the Beast, then the vampire attack… And they said Toussaint would be but wine and respite!]
   1180854|00000000||Tah rah ree-tah rah rah…
   1180860|00000000||{Garean!} [Watch out!]
   1180864|00000000||Tah ree rah… {Que?} [What?]
   1180862|00000000||Cheerio!
   1193906|00000000||Hm?
   1193908|00000000||Hm!
   1193910|00000000||Yaaaaawn…
   1187686|00000000||Regretfully, sign-ups are now closed. So sorry.
   1187675|00000000||They always did seem to have a fondness for one another.
   1187688|00000000||Hm… now which one will serve best?
   1187690|00000000||Uhh, do all contain the same hints? Err…
   1187684|00000000||Please collect your adventurer's kit - basket, letter, telescope and lantern.
   1187692|00000000||Geralt! You're here!
   1187703|00000000||Come on, let me have a look.
   1187669|00000000||Do you see anything? They should be in the woods.
   1187671|00000000||Gustav and Consuela… My, my… who would've thought?
   1187673|00000000||Let me!
   1187418|00000000||Harlotsbrood!
   1198701|00000000||Oh, yes! I heard the same, myself!
   1198699|00000000||Impossible!
   1200457|00000000||May fortune smile upon young Liam and Matilda.
   1198901|00000000||Coronata, ptooey! Hound's hinies, the lot!
   1187424|00000000||The duchess died! For your sins!
   1187426|00000000||Why are you still here?! You mean to foul up more things?!
   1187422|00000000||Do what they summoned you to do, then pack up and go back where you came from.
   1187420|00000000||A high and mighty Northerner, dog diddled dunglicker…
   1187428|00000000||Everyone! Murderers!
   1198707|00000000||I heard it was the witcher who sent all those vampires against the city. So he could play hero!
   1198705|00000000||The witcher and our duchess' sister? Partners in crime - he even helped her do in our dearest duquessa…
   1198703|00000000||More weeping and wailing's been heard near Caroberta Woods. No doubt it's the spirits frolicking 'midst the ruins of Termes palace.
   1187432|00000000||You cat-licked doo-doo diddler.
   1187430|00000000||Hullo.
   1127662|00000000||Oh, you scamp! You beat me. It's not happened in years! Your fists, they're… glorious.
   1127690|00000000||Thanks.
   1170947|00000000||I'm gob smacked, I am, I've to drink it off. Ooff! Good fight! To speak true, I'm pleased you stripped me of the title. I shall have more time to pursue my chief interest, now.
   1199623|00000000||Witcher Geralt of Rivia is hereby crowned Fisticuffs Champion of Beauclair! Bravo!
   1199625|00000000||Behold, your trophy.
   1199628|00000000||A life without liquor's like loving without licking.
   1127654|00000000||You fought well. Not near as well as I did, of course. My advice? Drink. Then drink more. Inadequate intoxication - that is clearly your problem.
   1127656|00000000||Mhm. We'll see next time.
   1178438|00000000||One thing I've learned - a man thumps like he drinks!
   1202210|00000000||To their bosoms your gods hold you.
   1202212|00000000||Folk of interest to meet on the road is an honor.
   1202186|00000000||A beautiful day for a tourney!
   1202188|00000000||Hail, fellow, well met!
   1202192|00000000||Toussaint! Anna Henrietta!
   1202194|00000000||For honor! And art! And poetry!
   1202190|00000000||To arms! To arms!
   1189665|00000000||Life's like an infant - it must be borne.
   1189667|00000000||Bathing tears away at the skin, and thus brings death closer!
   1189671|00000000||Fortune feeds on the poor.
   1189669|00000000||Ehh, brother?
   1152762|00000000||Dammit! Gotta catch it.
   1152759|00000000||[Attack the monster.]
   1178295|00000000||Let's eat, using the spoons.
   1191430|00000000||This isn't right… I miss something?
   1191432|00000000||Listen, gonna stand up real slow. Gotta search the house again. Sit tight. I'll be right back.
   1191437|00000000||Calm down.
   1178298|00000000||Been searching for the right spoon for years, right? But curses can be tricky.
   1180199|00000000||Key to this one just might be that you can't eat with your own spoon.
   1180201|00000000||That's why we've swapped.
   1178294|00000000||Let's swap spoons.
   1191410|00000000||We can't use spoons.
   1191413|00000000||No, that won't work. You've been looking for a spoon that would feed you, but there's no such spoon. We need to eat without spoons.
   1197809|00000000||Open your eyes. You need to see your likeness.
   1178296|00000000||Let's eat, not using the spoons.
   1192809|00000000||The curse - exact wording…
   1192823|00000000||Need to get this right. Words of the curse were: "None shall sit and dine with you at your table, no spoon you have shall sate you, never again shall you wish to spy your reflection in the mirror."
   1191394|00000000||I'm not gonna hurt you. Wanna help.
   1191398|00000000||I've seen the words of the curse on the walls. Think I know how to lift it.
   1191401|00000000||You tried to bring folk here, convince them to sit at the table with you, right? Well, I'm gonna be your guest now. Your willing guest.
   1191404|00000000||Just need a bit for Regis.
   1191407|00000000||And now we'll tend to you.
   1152760|00000000||[Try to lift the curse.]
   1152766|00000000||Seems I'll have to kill the wight in its own junk heap.
   1178310|00000000||Dammit… didn't work. Ate that vile stuff for nothing.
   1178312|00000000||Got the brew for Regis, at least. Can't do anything for the wight, though. Except cut it down.
   1152772|00000000||Hope there's a drop of brew left in the cauldron for Regis.
   1178314|00000000||Think it worked… Just, not quite like I expected.
   1180205|00000000||Need to see what happened to the wight.
   1178316|00000000||Won't be hard to find, given its stench.
   1152764|00000000||Cook hasn't had time to make the brew… Just foul, muddy water now.
   1152768|00000000||Now to carve out its salivary glands…
   1152770|00000000||Wight's salivary glands'll have to do for Regis. High time I got them to him.
   1188361|00000000||Shit, screwed up with the curse. Regis'll get what he wants, though. There is that.
   1210115|1797a75c||Cloud Giant
   1208589|00000000||Geralt decided to go home to Corvo Bianco.<br>
   1208604|00000000||At his new abode, an unexpected guest awaited… Yet it was someone Geralt was more than glad to see.<br>
   1178197|00000000||Go home.
   1178196|00000000||Be It Ever So Humble…
   1166754|00000000||Know what they're slopping up for supper tonight?
   1166756|00000000||I've no clue. But we're better off chomping grass the way that canteen reeks.
   1166758|00000000||The bleeding bumwipes! And to think they locked me up for selling rancid food.
   1166760|00000000||Nors, what you were selling had no right to be called food. That was worse than rat poison.
   1169782|00000000||Rubbish! Well-aged meat, that's all it was!
   1169784|00000000||Hah! Your aged meat had half of Toussaint galloping to the privy!
   1169786|00000000||That's because our courtiers have the bellies of colicky newborns.
   1192918|00000000||Should have sold your slop to peasants, then.
   1192920|00000000||Are you daft? First, peasants make their own food, and second, nobles pay a spit load more.
   1175806|00000000||Claw marks… Sharp, hooked claws. Monster had an easy time climbing on the roof…
   1175808|00000000||Smashed against the wall… skull cracked. Died immediately.
   1175810|00000000||Head, shoulder and neck wounds… Monster attacked from above. Jumped off the roof, I bet.
   1175812|00000000||Throat ripped open… larynx crushed…
   1175898|00000000||Stomach wall cut open in three places. Damaged organs, arteries.
   1175915|00000000||Sliced aorta. Fang marks alongside… but they're old, scarred over.
   1175917|00000000||Gunk… Is that venom? Hmm. Narrows the list of suspects.
   1175925|00000000||Beast killed the children, but didn't eat them… Something scare it off? Or grab its attention?
   1175937|00000000||Snff snff. Smell's not blood. Need to investigate.
   1175942|00000000||Blood stains… dried.
   1175985|00000000||Paw prints. Bipedal beast. Walks hunched over.
   1176030|00000000||Venom glands, long claws, a bloodsucker… must be a garkain. A pack leader, an alpha.
   1176032|00000000||For garkains, killing's a pleasure. Kids just whet its appetite. Must've gone after the guardians, too.
   1176349|00000000||Mhm. Garkain and wagon tracks merge… Wonder if the beast caught up. Roach!
   1176351|00000000||Drove off the road. Horses must've gotten spooked.
   1176400|00000000||Time to summon Regis… Slip a word to the birds, he said…
   1176402|00000000||Those kids… Orianna kept them, like farm foul or livestock. Dammit…
   1180144|00000000||Shredded her… then licked up her blood, every last drop.
   1180146|00000000||Garkain ate its fill here… Probably holed up nearby to digest.
   1180148|00000000||Aha.
   1184996|00000000||Garkain caught up. Trail ends here. Need to look around.
   1175900|00000000||Wounds're smooth-edged… claws cut through cleanly. Young, thin bones offered little resistance.
    524639|00000000||Dum duh dum, troll rain sing in.
    524641|00000000||What?
    524653|00000000||Vrrr…
    524643|00000000||Ugly 'uman.
    524662|00000000||Touchy nooo. Or hetroll me tell.
    524645|00000000||Ehh?
    524647|00000000||Knob head no good work?
    524649|00000000||Mercy! Mercy!
    524655|00000000||Give life to metroll.
    524651|00000000||Womans you knock-knock?
    524657|00000000||Aaargh!
    524659|00000000||She-troll smack. You dies.
   1193592|00000000||Such are the times, my good fellow.
   1193594|00000000||Ahh…
   1193596|00000000||Please accept my most heartfelt regards!
   1193598|00000000||Have mercy on me!
   1125519|00000000||Naezan salts. Hmm… Used to make compresses.
   1157509|00000000||Oh, fair Vivienne. Thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks.
   1157511|00000000||Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet.
   1157513|00000000||Thy two breasts are like… Hm…
   1125483|00000000||This is her tent. You must look inside, search it. I shall hoot like an owl should someone approach.
   1125497|00000000||Jar of concealing ointment. Powerful magic at work here.
   1126110|00000000||Hmm. Bruxae tend to be fond of birds…
   1125493|00000000||Oriole feather. Vivienne keep a bird as a pet? No sign of it here, if so.
   1199110|00000000||Claw marks, that's clear. Not sure what beast left them - just that it's big.
   1125499|00000000||Clothing's all dark-green and yellow. Seems Yen's not the only one with a fixed color scheme.
   1125552|00000000||Someone approaches! Quickly!
   1130774|00000000||You were supposed to hoot.
   1130776|00000000||We shall speak later. We must return to the tourney, now. It's… it's time for the second contest.
   1199392|00000000||Sirs! What seek you in my lady's tent? Inspiration? Begone from here!
   1125554|00000000||Why were you in there?!
   1125570|00000000||Uhh… tourney business. Nothing of import.
   1172002|00000000||Ready. We can start.
   1171465|00000000||Looks like all the barrels're full. Dead end, I'm afraid.
   1171467|00000000||Full, they are. The question is, are they full of Sangreal…?
   1171866|00000000||Grab a tap and a hammer. We shall open them one by one and taste.
   1171483|00000000||Sangreal. Barrels're dated 1268.
   1171485|00000000||Close, but not quite the right year.
   1166336|00000000||I've a feeling we'll find something awry…
   1166334|00000000||Hmm…
   1185340|00000000||Fiorano. Dandelion's favorite, adores it.
   1185342|00000000||Ah, yes, that sophisticated palate of his.
   1185344|00000000||Est Est… Think everyone and their mothers heard of this wine.
   1185346|00000000||Among the best in the world. Castel Ravello is famous for it.
   1185348|00000000||Got Pomino over here.
   1185352|00000000||Erveluce. I like it, quite dry.
   1185354|00000000||An excellent wine. You've good taste.
   1185700|00000000||Mhm… I'd recognize this taste anywhere. This one is good.
   1185702|00000000||Those hints of spice - distinctive. This is Sangreal.
   1179317|00000000||Slightly smoky, strongly tannic. Definitely Sangreal.
   1179315|00000000||So?
   1179319|00000000||Ptooey! Yuck! Hideous, sour rotgut. Clearly not Sangreal.
   1166330|00000000||So, where do we start?
   1166332|00000000||Let us see if all the barrels are present. Here's the inventory ledger.
   1166641|00000000||What if Fabricio's blackmailing the vampire? Considered that?
   1166338|00000000||He has his flaws, but I would never suspect him of such a thing.
   1166340|00000000||He's been very loyal. He owes all he has to me.
   1166648|00000000||His father frittered away the family fortune. He left his son an encyclopedic knowledge of wine, that is all.
   1171876|00000000||Fabricio lived as a beggar until I appointed him steward of Castel Ravello. Only then did he come into his own.
   1188935|00000000||Ptooey! Revolting, bitter plonk!
   1173077|00000000||Could've gone sour while aging.
   1173079|00000000||Impossible. This is not wine, this is contaminated refuse that should never have made it into a barrel.
   1173081|00000000||The fact that it did was no accident, I'm sure…
   1166050|00000000||Master Fabricio - let's see what he has to say about it.
   1185380|00000000||Step aside.
   1185374|00000000||Ready.
   1171479|00000000||Sangreal. 1270 vintage.
   1171481|00000000||That's the wrong year. Keep looking.
   1209389|00000000||Found it. Stored in a nook on the upper level. Just above our heads.
   1209391|00000000||Show me.
   1165998|00000000||Mhm… Vintner's log. Fermentation completed with no complications. Tapped above sediment line… Here it is - barreling.
   1166000|00000000||Hmm… everything lines up at first glance. Neatly and thoroughly documented.
   1166002|00000000||Then we must follow our other lead. Benoit said the stain came from the 1269 vintage. Let's find it.
   1185370|00000000||Got the taps.
   1185372|00000000||Then get to work. Let's broach those barrels.
   1165277|00000000||This one's full, too.
   1165273|00000000||Full.
   1186397|00000000||Wooden hammer. For tapping barrels.
   1171475|00000000||Right here - 1269. What now?
   1171477|00000000||Let's see if any barrels are empty.
   1171882|00000000||Wanna open them?
   1171884|00000000||For now, a knock will suffice. If you hear a hollow thud, we will have found what we seek.
   1172006|00000000||Mhm. Barrel taps.
   1193701|00000000||Hurry along! It's cold down here.
   1194403|00000000||Full.
   1194401|00000000||This one is full.
   1100872|00000000||I'm here.
   1114872|00000000||Let us go! We should arrive in time to have the best light of the day. The chiaroscuro we shall capture - just glorious!
   1103785|00000000||Let's go. The things I do for art…
   1103787|00000000||We had best ride there. We'll arrive faster and less fatigued.
   1103826|00000000||Ready to go, now.
   1103828|00000000||Wonderful! You had me worried, yes. I was concerned you had changed your mind.
   1103830|00000000||I commit to something, I follow through. Usually.
   1103782|00000000||No time to waste, then.
   1103790|00000000||Not so fast. Need to tend to something first.
   1103792|00000000||Humph. So be it. I shall await you here.
   1103783|00000000||Wait.
   1162887|00000000||Have you heard? Some new ringers over at "The Belles"!
   1162885|00000000||I've this damned itch under my stones. Would you mind scratching it?
   1162889|00000000||Bratch!
   1162891|00000000||Oh, crikey, I muddied myself…
   1162893|00000000||Would you like me to knock your gob in?
   1194667|00000000||I feel safer with you around, witcher.
   1194669|00000000||Hmm. Prrr.. Tee hee hee.
   1194671|00000000||Ah. I need a rest.
   1194673|00000000||Boor.
   1194675|00000000||Save me.
   1188655|00000000||Watch it!
   1188659|00000000||Problems? Hire a witcher! It's a good thing you've come.
   1188663|00000000||A tremendous tragedy… May our dear duquessa's soul rest in peace…
   1188661|00000000||A fruitful hunt to you, witcher.
   1188657|00000000||Congratulations on your victory in the tourney, Sir Geralt of Rivia.
   1188669|00000000||How fares your health, sir?
   1188665|00000000||My deepest regards.
   1188667|00000000||What's wrong with you?! Are you mad?!

    313947|00000000||What d'you want? Move on if you value your life, you pale cocksucker.
    313953|00000000||Piss off, ratmug. Hop-skip-trot.
    313955|00000000||He deaf or somethin'?
    313971|00000000||Just some lost cunt, I guess. Ploughin' freak…
    313975|00000000||Shit! Get the fucker!
   1151073|00000000||Ever fight a witcher, you piece of shit?
   1151071|00000000||Gonna hang your head from my saddle, bastard.

   1197196|00000000||Halt! No passage! No passage!
   1197198|00000000||Count di Salvaress' orders! The area is closed. A basilisk prowls nearby.
   1197200|00000000||No passage down this way. It's a hunting ground for the beast Count di Salvaress protects.
   1207081|00000000||The coloring on her back's changed… Iocaste seems highly aroused. As if she were readying herself for mating season.
   1208018|00000000||I'm to deliver a lecture soon before the Beauclair Nature Society. I shall mention you, witcher, with the utmost possible veneration.
   1204966|00000000||From the start, both Matilda and Liam insisted the problems at their vineyards had not appeared out of thin air. Naturally, they accused one another of foul play. Geralt suspected there was more to the matter, and yet again his intuition proved true. While solving the problems at the vineyards, he had happened on some notes. These suggested someone had intentionally planted archespores amidst the vines at both estates. The witcher had also found a key to the shelter where saplings of the beastly plants had been stored.<br>
   1204968|00000000||The dugout was almost completely empty. At any rate, the witcher found nothing to help him identify the individual behind the sabotage at Coronata and Vermentino. The mystery remained unsolved.<br>
   1204969|00000000||Geralt searched the dugout and learned that the sabotage at Coronata and Vermentino had been the brainchild of Count Vladimir Crespi.<br>
   1204970|00000000||Yet Geralt, for reasons known only to him, decided to keep the saboteur's identity to himself. Why, you might ask. Well, not even the greatest poets know the answer to that. Not even I know. For as they say, "witchers, like cats, walk their own paths."
   1204971|00000000||What Geralt had learned shed new light on the dispute between Liam and Matilda. It seemed Count Crespi had intentionally incited the quarrel between them. They decided to do him one better. Liam and Matilda settled their differences and formed a consortium.<br>
   1207070|00000000||While roaming the wild Caroberta Woods, Geralt came upon an abandoned dugout, its door locked. Earlier, while helping Matilda Vermentino with her vineyard, the witcher had come across an abandoned camp overgrown by thorny archespores. He had found a key amidst the camp's remains. Our hero can be nosy at times, so he now tried that key in the door of the dugout. Voilà! The door swung open slowly, and Geralt entered to see what was inside…<br>
   1213854|00000000||Toussaint is a land where spilling some wine is at times a greater crime than spilling some blood. Family vendettas, killings, poisonings - essentially events that could be termed wine wars - had once been the daily fare. In this day and age, however, vintners no longer resorted to such drastic measures, yet occasional sabotage remained an intrinsic element of competition in their domain… While traversing the duchy, Geralt happened upon evidence of just such a "wine dispute." He decided to look into the matter…<br>
   1213855|00000000||In pursuing his investigation to the end, the witcher discovered a nursery full of yellow archespore saplings hidden amidst the trees at the edge of the Caroberta Woods. From the notes he found there he learned that the crafty Count Crespi had been infesting vineyards competing against him with the deadly plants. Thus, through a string of coincidences, Geralt learned just how highly the Toussaintois valued their wines, so much so they were prepared to commit murder in the name of the vine. Indeed, it seems travel does broaden the mind.<br>
   1204963|00000000||Find the place mentioned in the letter.
   1204884|00000000||Search the warehouse using your Witcher Senses.
   1204885|00000000||Talk to Liam and Matilda.
   1204886|00000000||Defeat the archespore.
   1204929|00000000||Read the mysterious letter.
   1211174|00000000||[Optional] Destroy the archespore seedlings.
   1204960|00000000||Wine Wars: The Deus in the Machina
   1185676|00000000||"Ludovic then spake…"
   1185674|00000000||"The elven king, erect in his pride, drew his blade and dropped to his knees, thus acknowledging his final defeat…"
   1185654|00000000||"Then Divethaf filled the ornate ceremonial bowls with elven wine, gwinoedd, the sweetest blood of the land that had been torn from him."
   1185656|00000000||"At long last the elven king grasped his sword and shield, thus symbolically passing command of his armies to humans."
   1185652|00000000||"Divethaf laid at Ludovic's feet a loaf of bynnen, an elven bread, thus granting humans rule over seed-yielding lands."
   1196021|00000000||"Divethaf, the elven king, hosted Ludovic in his own palace, upon his own throne… amidst the blinding glow of a plethora of torches."
   1198477|00000000||How did you fare in there, witcher? Did our prison prove adequately comfortable?
   1198479|00000000||A hero, yet he's spent time in the clink.
   1190557|00000000||Do you prefer to go by Geralt of Rivia? Or… the Butcher of Blaviken?
   1190555|00000000||Why so pale, witcher? Does our climate not serve you?
   1190563|00000000||You're off beat, witcher… very off beat!
   1190561|00000000||Calm, now. It'll be over soon.
   1190559|00000000||One for all, all for one!
   1190565|00000000||Your crest - I didn't quite catch what it was.
   1190567|00000000||Well, well! Geralt of Rivia.
   1190569|00000000||Take one step closer and we shall cross blades!
   1150340|00000000||I've brought the prisoner, sir.
   1159538|00000000||Unbind him. And leave us.
   1150342|00000000||Greetings, witcher.
   1184599|00000000||Your face… doesn't look good.
   1184605|00000000||Though, looked even worse last time I saw you.
   1184607|00000000||Agh. I apply an arnica extract. I can hardly feel it anymore.
   1184601|00000000||What happened?
   1184603|00000000||The city was overrun, and I had no intention of hiding beneath my bed and waiting things out.
   1189062|00000000||But my scars pale in comparison to the fate Syanna met with. The fate that was your doing.
   1189064|00000000||I trusted you. And how did you repay me? Consider it, witcher - why do you think the duquessa had Syanna hidden away to start with? Can you guess?
   1189066|00000000||I'm sorry. Might not believe me, but… couldn't have predicted that turn of events. Certainly never wanted that.
   1189068|00000000||Enough. We shall speak of it no more.
   1184609|00000000||Guess there's been a decision in my case.
   1184611|00000000||Truly? Is that all you care about? Your own hide?
   1159566|00000000||Not only. Also care how the duchess feels, for example. And I hope that, unlike you, she doesn't blame this all on me.
   1159568|00000000||A court heard your case, not Anna Henrietta.
   1159556|00000000||A few other things I care about, too…
   1159555|00000000||My life? Yeah, I care.
   1159558|00000000||Get kinda anxious when my life's on the line.
   1159560|00000000||Your life was never threatened. The court considered various punishments, the death sentence was not among them.
   1159562|00000000||Wasn't in attendance, so I wouldn't know.
   1159564|00000000||You are in Toussaint, where the rule of law holds. We do not allow lynchings here, and every case is analyzed in minutest detail.
   1177816|00000000||It was a difficult case to decide. True, you killed the Beast of Beauclair, but you failed to prevent the death of Sylvia Anna - our duquessa's sister.
   1177818|00000000||The facts are as follows. You were hired to kill the Beast. Not only did you fail in that endeavor, but you also caused the death of our duquessa's sister. Have I missed anything?
   1177820|00000000||I'll have you know that were it up to me, you would rot in our dungeon until your dying day.
   1177822|00000000||Glad you didn't have the deciding vote, then.
   1177771|00000000||At any rate… I am not the best person to tell you what was decided in your matter. I'd say the man who worked hardest to tip the scales in your favor should.
   1177773|00000000||What're you talking about? What man?
   1177776|00000000||Dandelion?!
   1177778|00000000||Sheesh, Geralt, you look like you've seen a ghost.
   1177781|00000000||A ghost wouldn't have surprised me half this much, I promise you. What're you doing in Beauclair?
   1177783|00000000||Officially? Visiting Anarietta-- That is to say, the duchess. We're old friends - ah, but you know that. Unofficially? I'm saving your hiney.
   1177785|00000000||You? You're a persona non grata in Toussaint. Undesirable.
   1177787|00000000||Didn't stop me from risking my skin for you. In my book, friendship is all that matters. Well, friendship and love. And art. Oh, and wine…
   1177789|00000000||How'd you know I was here?
   1177800|00000000||How'd you even know I was in prison?
   1177802|00000000||Regis came to see me right after they locked you up. I mean, Regis, right? Can you believe that? To come back after…?! Amazing. He told me everything and, naturally, I couldn't possibly leave you to rot in there.
   1177788|00000000||How'd you manage to get me out?
   1177792|00000000||Take it I'm free thanks to you… how'd you manage it?
   1177798|00000000||Oh, I have my ways. Took a little persuasive logic, blended in some deft rhetoric, then added a generous pinch of charm, and voila - you're free.
   1177962|00000000||How's Priscilla?
   1211131|00000000||Meant to ask… Priscilla - how is she?
   1211133|00000000||Not well, unfortunately. After you left Novigrad, this one day, Priscilla was attacked. In the street.
   1211135|00000000||She was wounded badly, took a long time to recover. Luckily, she's better now.
   1211137|00000000||What are you talking about? Who the hell attacked her?
   1211139|00000000||Still looking for the bastard who hurt her. Once I find him, he'll regret what he did, regret the day he was born.
   1211141|00000000||Sorry, Dandelion. Sorry I wasn't around.
   1211143|00000000||Got your own problems, your own priorities. Can't expect you to be at my side whenever anything goes wrong. Besides, it's Priscilla, so I need to handle this.
   1177964|00000000||Been meaning to ask you - how's Priscilla?
   1177966|00000000||All right. Recovering steadily from the horrors she's been through.
   1177968|00000000||So you two… you're still…?
   1177970|00000000||Of course we are! How could you even think it was otherwise?
   1177972|00000000||No idea, just… within the realm of possibilities. But please be careful not to lead Anna Henrietta on, suggest you've come here for any reason beyond getting me out of my predicament.
   1177974|00000000||The bond between the duchess and myself is one of pure friendship, nothing more. Now, off to console a friend in need.
   1177961|00000000||See you later, Dandelion.
   1177976|00000000||All right, see you later.
   1185643|00000000||See you, Geralt.
   1198558|00000000||Off we go. You'll collect your things at the door.
   1177845|00000000||Listen, you do whatever needs doing, but I've got to get to the cemetery. Anarietta's in bad shape with Syanna dead.
   1188891|00000000||Some folk forget that under the ducal regalia she's just an ordinary woman who's lost a loved one.
   1177839|00000000||Mind being just a little more specific?
   1150360|00000000||Geralt, you were summoned here to hunt down and destroy the Beast of Beauclair. You undeniably did just that. Facts spoke for themselves, by and large.
   1150362|00000000||Then why the hell'd they throw me in prison?
   1164831|00000000||Specifically? Due to the duchess' sister's untimely demise. But I convinced Anarietta to treat that as a separate matter. After all, your contract said nothing about protecting Syanna.
   1159543|00000000||Thus, you will not only keep your vineyard, but you'll also receive a portion of the remuneration you're owed for killing the Beast of Beauclair.
   1159554|00000000||Dandelion, you're one clever little rascal.
   1164187|00000000||I'd do anything for a friend.
   1164189|00000000||Thanks.
   1150364|00000000||But just so you know, it wasn't easy. In fact, it was pretty damn hard.
   1159593|00000000||Duchess was so furious, I think she even forgot she'd banished me from Beauclair. For life. All she could do was scream that you'd never set foot outside that dungeon again.
   1159595|00000000||How'd you get her to take a fresh look at things?
   1159597|00000000||I appealed to the faultless intentions that guided you, to your reputation, your accomplishments and… well, ultimately, she changed her mind, and you're free. Never wants to see you again, but…
   1177841|00000000||Even got her to leave your vineyard with you. You won't get a copper of your promised reward, but you'll keep your estate.
   1177843|00000000||Dandelion, you're a regular master of diplomacy. Thanks.
   1169006|00000000||Don't smile so wide. Someone's liable to see, could mean trouble.
   1169028|00000000||I can't help myself. Just so glad to see you.
   1169030|00000000||Glad to see you too, my vampire friend.
   1167202|00000000||Fine, see what he has to say. Could use a good walk. Work out the kinks, if nothing else.
   1169040|00000000||Come, then.
   1167199|00000000||Fine. Let's go now.
   1169036|00000000||Guess it wouldn't hurt to talk to him… But let's meet there. Wanna look around town first, work out some kinks…
   1169038|00000000||Acceptable, I suppose. I shall await by the bootblack's stand.
   1167200|00000000||Join you later.
   1171579|00000000||Know what I say to that, Regis? Those murders don't interest me anymore. A drink, though - that's another matter.
   1171581|00000000||Then I invite you to join me for one. I'm certain to dig up a flask. Or two. Or three.
   1171577|00000000||Terrible idea.
   1169522|00000000||What'd you do while I, uh…?
   1169529|00000000||While you vegetated in that correctional facility? I used the time to think. Wish to know what I thought about?
   1169531|00000000||Course…
   1169533|00000000||The relationship between two numbers - Dettlaff's four victims and the Five Chivalric Virtues. As you've no doubt noted, there's a difference of one.
   1169535|00000000||Mean to tell me, after all we've figured out, that you now believe in the whole Five-Virtues-Punished theory?
   1169543|00000000||Belief's got nothing to do with it. It's cold logic, deduction. Syanna went to great lengths to make folk believe the Beast was punishing those who betrayed the Virtues.
   1169547|00000000||Were I in her shoes, I'd make sure the number of victims matched. Are you not at all curious who was meant to be the fifth?
   1169555|00000000||If I say yes, what then?
   1169557|00000000||Then you'll come with me for another chat with the bootblack. You see, I've learned he delivered the notes to Dettlaff. Our search starts with him.
   1169043|00000000||How's things?
   1169046|00000000||Thanks for intervening.
   1169048|00000000||Thanks for getting Dandelion to come out.
   1169514|00000000||It was nothing. True, he was not at first terribly eager to face the duchess… but I managed to persuade him his person was indispensable.
   1169516|00000000||Well played. Dandelion loves being indispensable.
   1169518|00000000||Yet he so rarely is, poor man.
   1188506|00000000||Care for a round of gwent?
   1182070|00000000||Round of gwent - whaddaya say?
   1156467|00000000||Time flies. Gotta go. See you.
   1156465|00000000||See you soon.
   1156463|00000000||Show me your wares.
   1156473|00000000||Show me what you got. See if something catches my eye.
   1156460|00000000||Greetings and welcome, sir! Toussaint is home to the best wines in the world, and I've the best wines in Toussaint!
   1156462|00000000||Welcome back, my friend. How can I be of service?
   1155658|00000000||Any idea what could've angered him?
   1155710|00000000||Anything specific, some set of things that'd be likely to set him off?
   1155712|00000000||How should I say this… Dettlaff doesn't understand men, their world, its rules, its conventions. He's naïve, in a sense. He doesn't comprehend your games, knows not what it means to lie, deceive.
   1155922|00000000||Suggesting he's maladjusted… and venting his rage?
   1155714|00000000||I'm suggesting maladjustment can at times breed conflict. But is it the case this time? I cannot say… but intend to find out.
   1155065|00000000||You were to stay where you were. Regenerate.
   1155230|00000000||I know you're in trouble. I can help.
   1155232|00000000||I'll help myself.
   1155235|00000000||No. He's my friend.
   1208706|00000000||Yes, Geralt. It's me.
   1152621|00000000||Regis…? I… You all right?
   1152623|00000000||All is well, all's in order. Wounds such as these heal on vampires in moments. But we've not seen one another in ages, my friend. At least in human terms, that is.
   1152625|00000000||How's this even possible? Last I saw you--
   1164985|00000000||I was a bubbling, shapeless smear, having been rather spectacularly melted into a column of a certain castle.
   1164987|00000000||In somewhat better shape now, as you can see. Hardly peak form, mind you, but were I human, folk would think me a demigod, I daresay.
   1155226|00000000||I'm sorry. What happened - it was my fault. Never got a chance to apologize.
   1155228|00000000||No need, Geralt. Bygones. I did not have to join you on that expedition. No one twisted my arm.
   1155276|00000000||How'd you… regenerate?
   1155279|00000000||Miraculous regeneration - how'd you manage it?
   1155282|00000000||I had help. From the one you hunt.
   1185113|00000000||Him? How? And what've you been doing all these years?
   1185115|00000000||Not the time nor place for such stories. I suspect we'll get a chance to speak at ease and at length later. Now, however, we must deal with the reason that brought us both here.
   1185119|00000000||You being here - not some fortunate coincidence, I take it.
   1155490|00000000||Your powers of deduction seem to have waned not one bit. I'm happy.
   1155493|00000000||I came here for Dettlaff. I fear he's become entangled, landed himself in serious trouble.
   1185121|00000000||So you being here, it's no coincidence…
   1155277|00000000||What brings you back after all these years?
   1155275|00000000||Killer I'm hunting - seems you know him.
   1155286|00000000||Local serial killer seems to obey you. Maybe you could talk him out of it, convince him to stop murdering.
   1155288|00000000||Why do you think I've come? It shall not be easy, as Dettlaff can be rather stubborn. Though you must certainly recall that neither do I surrender readily.
   1155284|00000000||So that's his name. He's your… friend?
   1155494|00000000||You might call it that. Though Dettlaff is… how would you humans put it… more bestial than I am. But not to worry, I'm working on him.
   1155496|00000000||Haven't exactly done a great job with that. He's killed one knight since I got here, least three others before I arrived.
   1155498|00000000||For good reason, I'm sure. Understand, Dettlaff is not some decadent shit who kills for sport or to assuage a dryness of throat or a dullness of mood.
   1155528|00000000||Seem pretty damn sure of that.
   1155530|00000000||I am. Because I know him very well.
   1155504|00000000||How can you be so sure?
   1165213|00000000||Everyone's got their reasons, but he's crossed a line. Want him to stop - don't give a damn why he's doing it.
   1165215|00000000||Perhaps you should. Motivations change the contours of all situations. A thief who steals to feed his family versus one who steals out of greed - would you not treat them differently?
   1165219|00000000||Mean to suggest Dettlaff's killing out of some worthy, dire need?
   1165221|00000000||I merely suggest he's not a bloodthirsty monster who murders simply for the joy of it. That's just not him.
   1165205|00000000||Don't give a damn about his motivations.
   1155503|00000000||What good reasons could he possibly have?
   1155538|00000000||So in your opinion, what're his reasons?
   1155540|00000000||Precisely what I wish to find out. And then I will convince him of the error of his ways.
   1155542|00000000||Got a lot of faith in the guy.
   1169931|00000000||Despite appearances to the contrary, you two are quite alike. You've both noble hearts yet you both are wont to perform ignoble deeds - when circumstances force you to, of course.
   1169933|00000000||Remember the year 964?
   1169935|00000000||That was three centuries ago…
   1169937|00000000||Blind fear gripped Rivia, Lyria and Spalla. Women and children were dying, their mutilated, dismembered corpses littered the fields.
   1169939|00000000||Brute of Lyria - read about it. Chewed up almost two hundred, then fell to a common poacher supposedly armed with a dagger blessed by some prophet--
   1169941|00000000||It fell to Dettlaff. Who then found a poacher asleep in the brush near his snares and dropped the fiend's corpse at his feet. And thus, a legend was born.
   1169959|00000000||Awfully good of him. But… do I need to know this?
   1169961|00000000||Yes. So you'll understand Dettlaff is no cold-blooded killer. I believe he's landed in some mess, and he sees no way out.
   1169976|00000000||What makes you say that?
   1169943|00000000||Why tell me this? Any reason?
   1169942|00000000||Why'd Dettlaff kill the monster?
   1169951|00000000||Hm. Vampires rarely help humans. Must've had his own agenda, hunting the beast.
   1169953|00000000||You err. He slew it for one reason alone - the monster killed a lad who once, in the street, had offered Dettlaff an apple, expecting nothing in return.
   1169955|00000000||Terribly noble of him.
   1169957|00000000||You do not have a monopoly on altruism, my friend.
   1155544|00000000||Vilgefortz melted my body. Dettlaff found what was left. As per our codex, he had a choice - to leave me where I was, or to care for me, nurture my remains.
   1160556|00000000||He chose the latter. Regenerated me at no small expense in his own blood. Do you know what that means to a vampire, the gravity of the endeavor?
   1155548|00000000||Probably same thing it means to a human. You owe him your life.
   1160558|00000000||Much more than that. The act itself made us blood brethren, a bond so strong humans cannot even imagine. Which is why I know something ill is afoot.
   1190020|00000000||Always had an overdeveloped sense of empathy.
   1190022|00000000||Each vampire has a unique talent. One they hone over centuries. It's precisely what renders us so difficult to classify. Dettlaff's trump card is his herd instinct, his tribal propensity.
   1155550|00000000||In point of fact, he prefers the company of lesser vampires and shuns that of humans. If he walks among you, killing egregiously, it can only mean something's upset him. Immensely.
   1155657|00000000||Gotta find him.
   1159189|00000000||Witcher! We flew here as fast as our coursers would carry us. Yet I fear we're late all the same! Pray, where is the Beast?!
   1159191|00000000||Still investigating, about to inspect this site. Withdraw your men before they trample all over the evidence.
   1159196|00000000||Ahem, sirs! We must let the witcher do his work. Milton's murder cannot go unavenged.
   1159200|00000000||Hear that?
   1159202|00000000||The posse. Knights must've tracked me here.
   1159204|00000000||I'd prefer they not find me here. I've makeshift quarters at Mère-Lachaiselongue cemetery. We'll meet there.
   1169986|00000000||See you.
   1155660|00000000||Gotta find him. Before something upsets him even more and all Beauclair is awash with blood.
   1155705|00000000||Well, we share a cause, then. Just like the old days…
   1155707|00000000||Not entirely. I mean, when I find him, you know--
   1155720|00000000||I know you've a contract on his head. Yet your true task is to stop the Beast killing, not necessarily to kill the Beast, am I right?
   1155722|00000000||All in all, sure.
   1155724|00000000||Let us find him. By the time we do, I hope I'll have convinced you Dettlaff is no monster.
   1155726|00000000||Fine, all right already. But for now, evidence is stacking up against him…
   1193752|00000000||Good sirs, we must allow the witcher to ply his trade.
   1193727|00000000||Good hunting to you, witcher. We're relying on your mastery of your craft.
   1194498|00000000||Aye, sir?
   1194500|00000000||What will the morrow bring?
   1194622|00000000||Who're you?
   1194624|00000000||So much work…
   1194626|00000000||Got this crackin' in me spine.
   1199550|00000000||I'm well aware witchers work for hire, for pay. But I've no coin, alas. I can offer only this…
   1199553|00000000||Hmm… Potatoes?
   1199555|00000000||A good crop this year. Exceptional.
   1170034|00000000||I did what I had to.
   1170036|00000000||Right. Agreed. Let's head back to the hermit's.
   1123746|00000000||Drove off the phantom. But it'll be back sooner or later. It'll keep coming till you forgive Marcello his deed.
   1127688|00000000||It's his specter that torments you.
   1123748|00000000||I will never forgive him! Never! Petty rage drove him to torture that innocent beast to death! He's an evil man who deserves no mercy.
   1170628|00000000||He'll never let you rest if you don't forgive him.
   1127700|00000000||I cannot forgive him. He'll get no pardon from me… If I, too, must suffer for his sin, so be it. Such is my fate.
   1170630|00000000||Yet still, I thank you for your help. Knowing the cause grants me some respite. There's that, at least.
   1191923|00000000||As agreed - take this. For your trouble.
   1191939|00000000||Don't wanna forgive him, don't have to. But if that's the case, draw salt lines along your threshold, on your window sills. Might keep him out.
   1164975|00000000||Gotta admit - easy-peasy with our powers combined. So what now? We hit the Path? Ride to the nearest notice board, rustle up another contract…?
   1169927|00000000||Exactly. Though, effects of the brew're waning, I can feel it. Won't be able to understand you, soon.
   1169929|00000000||Grrr… that's horseshit. I mean, I got so much more I want to tell you, and… Hmmppphrr…
   1169945|00000000||Clever beasts, horses. Farewell, witcher.
   1191963|00000000||Oughta thank my horse, actually. Phantom's departure - mostly Roach's doing.
   1191965|00000000||Then I thank you, too, noble creature.
   1191960|00000000||As agreed - your reward. With my thanks.
   1123742|00000000||Phantom's gone. Shouldn't torment you ever again.
   1123744|00000000||I felt a change, I did, as if I'd been released from a cramped, dank cellar.
   1191972|00000000||I had come to believe no one could help me. I'm grateful, witcher.
   1170024|00000000||Heheh. All right, then. Guess we might as well head back. Pinastri's nights oughta be ghost-free from now on. Anything to add, Geralt?
   1170026|00000000||Nope. Let's go see her.
   1207843|00000000||Phantom you told me about… still your tormentor?
   1164910|00000000||No, all is well. I thank you for your help. So much.
   1164912|00000000||But I… I didn't do anything.
   1169990|00000000||I was talking to Roach. Your horse helped me, told me my tormentor was a friend who had passed recently. Failing to find peace in the afterlife, he'd returned as a specter.
   1169992|00000000||Roach solved your problem herself?
   1169994|00000000||That's right. And quickly! Oh, now she asks that I convey to you her regards.
   1169996|00000000||Hmm. Thanks. Take care, now.
   1164917|00000000||Phantom still tormenting you?
   1207845|00000000||Phantom you told me about… still your tormentor?
   1164916|00000000||It does. Grants me no rest…
   1170007|00000000||Sorry. Didn't manage to catch it.
   1191911|00000000||And I wasted my stock of graytop to make you that brew. I knew from the start it wouldn't work. I fear there's no hope left for me, now. Begone.
   1164918|00000000||Phantom still tormenting you?
   1192378|00000000||Decent folk you mention - mean yourselves?
   1192380|00000000||Why? Do you doubt it?
   1192382|00000000||Hell yes.
   1192384|00000000||Hear that, Artois? He poking insults us! On our own turf!
   1192386|00000000||We should step aside, good fellow. My friend is perfectly capable of settling this unfortunate dispute on his own.
   1192375|00000000||Meaning you? You're decent?
   1192376|00000000||What's the harm in them living here?
   1192389|00000000||The shelter, them living here - bothers you. Question is why.
   1192391|00000000||Look, Ballard! Another defender of the poor, fighter for justice!
   1192393|00000000||Damn nuisance! We've our women and young folk living next door, when even grown men fear to walk past such rabble.
   1183984|00000000||You - what do you want?
   1177545|00000000||To talk.
   1177547|00000000||Here that's a waste of breath! We've tried it, only to tire our lips! We'll use other means of persuasion, now.
   1177549|00000000||Gentlemen, calm, please…
   1177551|00000000||Either get out along with these flea-ridden vagabonds or we'll toss you all out! Our patience is gone. This place is no longer a rank refuse dump!
   1192374|00000000||Scram! Decent folk live here.
   1188815|00000000||Take me with you? Please?
   1188813|00000000||A strapping lad!
   1200647|00000000||Warm cow piddle tastes better than Coronata wine!
   1188817|00000000||Oh, I'd stomp wine with that one… We would stomp till we were red and sweaty!
   1188819|00000000||Here, kitty, kitty! Rowr, akhem, meow!
   1113260|638c0dc6||Vivienne
   1193723|7a70fb1a||Shaelmaar
   1195353|00000000||Uahahaha!
   1195355|00000000||Gotta get around 'im.
   1195364|00000000||He's a warlock!
   1195366|00000000||Need a bop?
   1195368|00000000||Slaughter the freak!
   1195370|00000000||Fuckin' come on!
   1195372|00000000||Bugger me mug!
   1195374|00000000||{*Hawk*} Ptooey!
   1195376|00000000||Oy, mate. Watch it.
   1195378|00000000||All right, let's dance.
   1207881|00000000||Geralt defeated three lesser contenders in fistfighting bouts and thus earned the right to face off against the Maestro.<br>
   1199960|00000000||The witcher soundly defeated Toussaint's reigning champion.<br>As a reward, he was given a trophy he truly could be proud of.<br>
   1207884|00000000||Defeat the Maestro in a fistfight.
   1201524|00000000||Defeat the vampires attacking the city.
   1207882|00000000||Raging Wolf
   1180986|00000000||Master witcher! What can I do for ye?
   1180988|00000000||I've nothin' to say to ye. Away and boil yer heid!
   1193386|00000000||You deaf, or you death?
   1193392|00000000||What now? What?
   1193394|00000000||Buurrp. Akh… bleugh…
   1193388|00000000||Let me alone.
   1193390|00000000||Aaaaa.
   1125256|00000000||Fine. Doubt I'll have any trouble deflecting a few blows.
   1192876|00000000||That I get. At long last, one with a sportsman's soul. Now listen, the rules say you're not to start your parry until I've cocked my fist. Standing with your guard up's not allowed!
   1125258|00000000||Ladies and gentlemen! Witness a most peculiar fight! How shall I say this? The witcher has accepted a colossal challenge!
   1125253|00000000||Block your blows no problem.
   1125260|00000000||Prefer to slap you around the ordinary way.
   1171539|00000000||Ehh, disappointing. This witcher's no fun at all. Oh well, I suppose it makes little difference.
   1125262|00000000||Ladies and gentlemen! A fight, a fight, a fight, at last! Standard regulations! Witcher versus Colossus!
   1125254|00000000||Prefer a normal fight.
   1125236|00000000||Fine. Let's fight.
   1125238|00000000||Bleh, boooring. I'm not interested. Quick I am, too quick for you. It'll be knick-knack paddy whack, here's your arm bone. Where's the sport in it?
   1171520|00000000||Don't wanna fight? Why bother looking for challengers, then? Wasting my time.
   1171522|00000000||Whoa, a bit testy, are we? A witcher, right? Let's do it like this - you parry three blows I throw your way, you win. But you can't swing at me. Not once.
   1197871|00000000||Just deflect my blows, got it? Catch three of them, and I'll toss you double your wager.
   1171531|00000000||Feeling that generous?
   1171533|00000000||No. I just know you can't do it. No one's ever done it. Too fast, see? So, willing to try for three blocks?
   1125232|00000000||Yeah. I'm in.
   1125252|00000000||Not in the mood for a scrap just now. Maybe later.
   1125234|00000000||Not about to fight just now.
   1125233|00000000||Colossus - that's his name?
   1125248|00000000||Colossus? Interesting as monickers go. Or is that what his mother called him out of the womb, too?
   1125250|00000000||Why would she not have? Colossus - it rings out with pride and passion! So, will you fight?
   1125223|00000000||Oh, now you look to be a man in search of exertion! Hey! Whitelocks! Will you dare to fight Colossus?
   1171444|00000000||A witcher? Would you stand against Colossus, sir?
   1125227|00000000||Nature of the contest?
   1125229|00000000||Pounding, punching, regulation pugilism. The first to swoon, loses. Simple, is it not?
   1171446|00000000||Defeat the three lesser champions to face the Maestro himself. Pure diversion. So, are you in?
   1160437|00000000||Witcher. Colossus awaits. Ready to test your strength?
   1199660|002e7985||Cael
   1171689|00000000||Good evening!
   1171687|00000000||Sacrayblue! Ugh, pardon my Toussaintois.
   1193329|00000000||Wa-wa-wee-wa…! Witcher drove waway the Beast!
   1171693|00000000||Wa-wa-wee-wa…! A witcher's come 'round to take a crack at the Beast!
   1171691|00000000||Oh! Witcher Geralt! The duquessa's darling!
   1105724|00000000||Rather not have the griffin in the painting.
   1103756|00000000||No. It's too mangled, too gruesome this way .
   1103758|00000000||Hmm… Indeed. The hue of its blood would not go well with your complexion.
   1103768|00000000||Ah, very well. That will do for now. I shall polish the details later. No point struggling on in this fading light.
   1105722|00000000||Ah. I almost forgot. Payment for your troubles.
   1104031|00000000||And I thank you for saving my life. Though in doing so, you did also save your likeness… for posterity!
   1103752|00000000||Yeah, let's add it. Carcass can serve as your prop.
   1103754|00000000||Splendid! Hmm… Interesting color palette… And the textures! And the proportions! It will do, yes, it will do.
   1163599|00000000||But I shall paint it in later in my atelier. There's an excellent illustration in the Encyclopaedia Maxima Mundi. I fear this specimen is, well… too far cut and chopped.
   1105723|00000000||Yeah. Paint it in.
   1101043|00000000||Is it safe?
   1101045|00000000||Yeah. Come on out. And no wonder no one ever came here - it was a griffin's hunting ground.
   1101047|00000000||That thing scared me to death.
   1101049|00000000||Not quite to death. You are alive. Not least because you chose a witcher to sit for you. How's the painting? It survive, too?
   1101051|00000000||It did. But I cannot show it to you now. I never display unfinished work.
   1115397|00000000||You can see it tomorrow, after midday, where we met. I shall display it in the market square.
   1105718|00000000||Ffhh, monstrous beast. Shall we immortalize it in the painting?
   1205167|00000000||Belgaard had been the jewel in Toussaint's crown of vineyards. Yet since the death of its owner, Count Crespi, it had fallen on hard times.

   1205165|00000000||Belgaard had been the jewel in Toussaint's crown of vineyards. Yet since the death of its owner, Count Crespi, it had fallen on hard times. The ducal clerk had been tasked with finding a new steward, but only one who stood to restore Belgaard's reputation and fame.<br>The inspection yielded one conclusion - Liam de Coronata's and Matilda Vermentino's newly formed consortium faced quite the challenge. And the witcher once again had much to do…<br>
   1205164|00000000||Naturally, the witcher rose to the challenge. But would you ever expect anything less? He did Liam and Matilda a vast favor, yet this did little to mend their tenuous relationship. Belgaard's new co-owners remained aloof towards one another. The witcher could only hope that their working side by side would in time foster greater trust.<br>
   1205168|00000000||Thanks to the witcher, the Belgaard Vineyard could shine once more. Relations between Liam and Matilda were also improving, the two young co-owners now clearly fond of one another.

   1210191|00000000||Naturally, the witcher rose to the challenge. But would you ever expect anything less? He rid Belgaard of its problems and the vineyard could shine once more. Pleased with the developments, the ducal clerk could now hand the title to the vineyard to the ambitious Liam, who in turn rewarded the witcher generously. Our hero thus set off on his Path, pleased with himself for a job well done.<br>

   1210088|00000000||This tale had begun with wine and vineyards, and it was with wine in a vineyard that it came to an end. The wine in question had been made with Geralt in mind. It was final proof of Matilda Vermentino's and Liam de Coronata's gratitude. For the witcher had not only helped them grow their enterprise, he had also caused them to realize they had feelings for one another, feelings that now sprouted and bloomed. Quite the matchmaker Geralt proved to be. Who could've known?<br>
   1210167|00000000||Geralt had become deeply involved in the matter of the Belgaard Vineyard's transfer to a new owner. So when the ducal clerk asked him for yet another favor, he could hardly refuse and promised to visit this estate that was said to produce exceptional wine…<br>
   1202552|00000000||Solve all of Belgaard vineyard's problems.
   1205149|00000000||Go see Matilda.
   1205150|00000000||Go see Liam.
   1205151|00000000||Go see Liam and Matilda.
   1205443|00000000||Go to Belgaard.
   1210172|00000000||Wait 3 days, then go see Liam and Matilda.
   1210190|00000000||Go see Liam and Matilda.

   1155209|00000000||You don't look a quarryman to me.
   1184032|00000000||That stand in the way of our doing business?
   1184034|00000000||No. It merely means I doubt you'll find anything of use here. I mainly stock goods for the men at the quarry - hammers, spikes, hand cream. But if you want a glance, feel free, I shan't stop you.
   1155219|00000000||Craft something for me, will you?
   1155213|00000000||Like you to craft something for me.
   1163190|00000000||You always this personable, or d'you just get up on the wrong side of the bed this morning?
   1163192|00000000||I got up on the right side. I always do. My left leg's been lame ever since my accident.
   1184049|00000000||I worked here once, see, breaking stone… until a part of a rock face fell away and crushed my foot.
   1184051|00000000||Hm. Sorry. Feel foolish, now.
   1184053|00000000||Not to worry. Such things are commonplace here, part of the job. Every now and then someone breaks something, twists an ankle… or their neck.
   1155214|00000000||You're a real welcoming fellow.
   1155221|00000000||Gotta go. Farewell.
   1155215|00000000||Gotta go.
   1155212|00000000||Show me your goods?
   1155217|00000000||Show me what you got.
   1155211|00000000||You again? Well, out with it - what do you want?
   1126746|2ca4fd85||Anna Henrietta
   1204759|00000000||Hm…
   1204819|00000000||The light, it's positively useless. She can't possibly see a thing.
   1204821|00000000||What, precisely, is that?
   1204823|00000000||And abstract work, gentlemen. The future of art.
   1204755|00000000||Mademoiselle, are you certain you dropped it right here?
   1204807|00000000||Yes! I cannot return without my engagement ring…!
   1204809|00000000||No, no! Please do not weep! I shall continue searching.
   1204753|00000000||Behold the fearless Zampanò of Belhaven!
   1204803|00000000||A fire eater? Who invited him?
   1205003|00000000||Nursed upon Mount Quartz's slopes by a she-dragon from her own teet, flames do him no harm!
   1204805|00000000||Nonsense, and tasteless to boot. Come, darling.
   1204935|00000000||Fret not, big man. Buffoons, naught else.
   1204937|00000000||I want to go back to the circus.
   1204939|00000000||It's a shame the midget knows no tricks. That would be funny, at the least.
   1204941|00000000||Let's go to the picnic! I wish to see the unicorn!
   1205015|00000000||A gift of the gods, you are!
   1204943|00000000||It must be somewhere…
   1205013|00000000||I thank you! Again!
   1205011|00000000||There you go.
   1205009|00000000||Oh! Thank you! I… I know not how to repay you!
   1204945|00000000||Here! It's an heirloom! It was my grandmama's!
   1204947|00000000||Thank you..
   1204949|00000000||What a charming man.
   1204951|00000000||He's as good as Master Dandelion.
   1204953|00000000||You might also wish to catch my vernissage at the residence of Madame Orianna.
   1204955|00000000||To me it's spots and blotches. I don't know…
   1204957|00000000||It's the future of painting, I tell you.
   1205000|00000000||No, rubbish, that will never catch on.
   1204757|00000000||Out flew the web and floated wide.
   1204811|00000000||The mirror crack'd from side to side.
   1205318|00000000||"The curse is come upon me," cried the Lady of Hengfors.
   1204815|00000000||Ahhh.
   1204817|00000000||Lovely.
   1209705|00000000||Novigrad this is not! You must behave!
   1209709|00000000||Hey, diddle, diddle!
   1209711|00000000||Mediocre and mediocre-er!
   1209707|00000000||You gray-domed, gray-bottomed…. tush!
   1209715|00000000||You're in Beauclair. Mind your manners.
   1209713|00000000||We Toussaintois tolerate no troublemakers!
   1209717|00000000||A sword? I'll show you a figgy sword!!
   1209721|00000000||Should the Beast you espy, tell the commander, be spry!
   1209719|00000000||Long live Duchess Anna Henrietta!
   1187589|00000000||I pledge, my love, to win the tourney! With your name on my lips!
   1194808|00000000||But what if another knight proves victorious? Many a valiant man has entered the lists this year…
   1194810|00000000||If it be so, then I pledge to remain silent and not remove my helmet until I fulfill my first pledge to you next year.
   1172920|00000000||Go in peace!
   1172922|00000000||I haven't any strength left…
   1198491|00000000||Whatever shall we do without Our Grace?
   1172924|00000000||Agh. About to collapse…
   1172926|00000000||Lebioda's toenails…
   1172928|00000000||Someone! Anyone!

   1203525|00000000||<i>The earth’s innards are home to mighty strange and fearsome beasts. Were they ever to decide to ramble up to the surface, we’d all be gutted the very first day o’ the invasion.<br>– Ramus Vendenratz, Mahakam foreman.</i><br><br>Shaelmaars spend most of their lives deep underground, having no contact with the world up above. At times, however, a shaelmaar will dig its way to the surface and devour any men within its reach. Some shaelmaars also burrow tunnels close to the surface, collapsing buildings and causing tremors in the process.<br><br>Since shaelmaars are blind, they find their way by sensing vibrations and listening for sounds. Thus the best tactic when fighting such a monster is to hurl something heavy or noisy against a nearby boulder or wall. Then pray silently that the beast will roll towards the sound and knock itself out upon striking into the obstacle.<br>
   1208639|00000000||Clumsy shaelmaars might seem easy targets to hit, but when even your strongest blows bounce off the thick armor plating their backs, you realize they’ve little need to dodge. When threatened, a shaelmaar will curl up in a ball and roll forward with tremendous impetus, becoming an unstoppable force crushing everything in its path.<br><br>A witcher’s best bet is to stay out of a charging shaelmaar’s way and strike after its charge fails, revealing its vulnerable underbelly.<br><br>A witcher of particular cunning and agility will use the Aard Sign or a bomb (Samum works particularly well for this purpose) to cause the shaelmaar to slam into an obstacle at full speed, significantly lowering its fighting ability and opening the witcher's path to victory. Trying to disorient a shaelmaar in this way is a risky maneuver, but can be effective, especially when third parties are threatened.

   1191840|00000000||Our trouble's over - time to put your house in order, Snow White. We've had excitement enough.
   1196671|00000000||Geralt, good you're here. Ready to attack Dun Tynne?
   1211307|00000000||So eager, are you? The mill, then. We shall discuss the assault inside.
   1200314|00000000||Need to hit them from both sides. You draw the defenders, keep them busy. I'll sneak in the back way, find the women, make sure they come to no harm.
   1200316|00000000||I'll vault over the wall as soon as you start your assault.
   1200318|00000000||Your plan puts you at great risk… but I sense you will handle it well. Let us go.
   1200320|00000000||Cintrian's men, gotta be. Ran into a few in town - they tried to kill me.
   1184437|00000000||See you already prepared a plan. Walk me through it?
   1189269|00000000||We have two objectives - to find Her Illustrious Highness' sister and capture the men who blackmailed the vampire.
   1183291|00000000||Dun Tynne is a modest complex - several old buildings, a high wall around them. At the center of the enclosure stands an imposing keep, restored not long past by the elderly knight of the castle, Roderick.
   1184420|00000000||We mean to strike here, through the main gate, then secure the area in front of the keep by storm.
   1184439|00000000||How many men defend Dun Tynne? You know?
   1184441|00000000||Roderick maintains a team of knights for defense. They are no army, but they could number several dozen.
   1197929|00000000||Also, Roderick recently took in a band of foreign mercenaries. About them we know very little.
   1196678|00000000||Yeah, I'm ready. We got a plan?
   1196682|00000000||Need a bit longer.
   1196684|00000000||Do not tarry. Time is not our friend.
   1196680|00000000||Give me a minute.
   1196696|00000000||So? Ready for the assault?
   1200322|00000000||Remember, we must find and rescue Her Grace's sister. Not a hair on her head is to be harmed.
   1200324|00000000||Roderick's men are not to be underestimated. They are few, but none will surrender without a fight.
   1200264|00000000||We must get to the keep quickly. Here, this way.
   1198149|00000000||I'm early. No guardsmen yet.
   1183779|00000000||One day you're there drinking wine, the next some vampire's drinking your blood…
   1183781|00000000||The duchy will never be the same again without our Grace, the duchess…
   1183777|00000000||On destiny's slender path endure, in battle, rage, persist. Your blade shall know no taste of rust - blood shall its sheen obscure.
   1183775|00000000||Let me keep then, please, this treasury of memories, this magic blossom glistening with tear-like drops of dew. It I shall cherish until the day I perish, this living sign of love that bloomed that we so fiercely once consumed.
   1196508|00000000||Do you know what I heard? Filibert Fourfingers and his hanse, they've been gutted to a man! They say Filibert howled like an urchin, but the witcher showed no mercy and lopped off his head!
   1196510|00000000||Have you heard about the quarry? They say the lads hung up their picks when a rain of cows came pummeling down!
   1196506|00000000||The witcher they summoned - he murdered the kings of the North! Or so the dockside merchants say…
   1183783|00000000||Are you drunk?! Do you want to make trouble?!
   1196512|00000000||Incredible…
   1196514|00000000||I couldn't care less. Instead of gossiping, why don't you take up some fruitful labor?
   1183785|00000000||Had a bit much?!
   1183789|00000000||Vanity of vanities… all is narcissism.
   1183787|00000000||Ehh. Hullo.
   1184718|00000000||I think I've caught something…
   1184720|00000000||Achoo! Lebioda's festering wounds…
   1184724|00000000||Hey there, good fellow.
   1184722|00000000||Watch out or I shall sneeze all over you!
   1188125|00000000||The Mandragora is soon to feature a performance by Geoffrey de Girion, I heard.
   1196533|00000000||Personally, I've never been fond of his "art."
   1196535|00000000||Why ever not? A painter forging his works in the public eye? Why it's true and intimate contact with the creative process.
   1196537|00000000||He pee-pees. On a canvas.
   1196539|00000000||Of course he does! He himself claims his art issues from the deepest recesses of his being.
   1178821|00000000||Pam pa ram, pam pam pa ram, pam pa ram!
   1195055|00000000||You killed Starling Straggen. I'll slice off your stones.
   1178823|00000000||Why, you've really peeved me now…
   1178825|00000000||Now why'd you have to do that, laddie boy?
   1178827|00000000||My composure is gone. You ruined it.
   1178829|00000000||Grab the harlotsbrood!
   1178831|00000000||Smack the scallywag!
   1178833|00000000||Ahh, fumbledunks!
   1178835|00000000||Spells! He's casting spells!
   1144289|00000000||*Sniff sniff* Quite the fragrant whiff… What is the Pheasantry stewing up?
   1144291|00000000||Patrolling on an empty stomach… Ugh, dreadful.
   1192745|00000000||I never knew vampire extermination's could be so hard. I've worked up quite the appetite.
   1144293|00000000||Cut off his escape!
   1144297|00000000||May your cream curdle!
   1144299|00000000||Not had enough?! Still?!
   1144301|00000000||We'll boil you in a bouillabaisse!
   1144295|00000000||Choke on it, you rapscallion!
   1144303|00000000||You'll hang for that!
   1144305|00000000||Tsk tsk, witcher!
   1144307|00000000||Follow me! Follow me!
   1144309|00000000||Whoa-ho, you shan't be needing that steel!
   1144311|00000000||He's magicking!
   1144313|00000000||Now why did you have to go and do that…?
   1144315|00000000||That's it!
   1144319|00000000||Say, do witchers eat their cheese before dessert or after?
   1144317|00000000||Feeling peckish? Head to the Pheasantry!
   1194050|00000000||Take care, sonny.
   1194052|00000000||The White Wolf himself!
   1194060|00000000||Oh!

   1197713|00000000||The Duchess! Our Grace!
   1197732|00000000||Anarietta!
   1197744|00000000||Onward, Your Grace!
   1197763|00000000||My wine!
   1197765|00000000||Forget your mutt-piss wine! It's the duchess!
   1197767|00000000||Anarietta!
   1197769|00000000||Let's follow her!
   1197771|00000000||Follow the duquessa!
   1197742|00000000||Mama! Papa! Anarietta!
   1197773|00000000||Your Grace!
   1197775|00000000||Her Illustrious Highness has arrived!
   1198239|00000000||Look!
   1198241|00000000||Huzza! Bravo!
   1198243|00000000||Hooray!
   1197736|00000000||Look on, good folk! Our Lady, the Duchess!
   1197738|00000000||Long may she live!
   1197740|00000000||Long may she live!
   1198144|00000000||Bravo, Your Grace!
   1197734|00000000||Long live Anarietta!
   1197777|00000000||Ahh! Look!
   1197779|00000000||It's her! It's her!
   1211243|00000000||Who is that mad man?!
   1211245|00000000||Oh! It's a witcher!
   1205742|00000000||Have mercy, take pity, please…
   1114564|00000000||The light is… inopportune at the moment. Could you return around noon?
   1198254|00000000||You know Filibert Fourfingers? The leader of that hanse up Mont Crane? They say he takes a finger off any man whose life he spares, then adds it as a jewel to the string around his neck!
   1197869|00000000||All the sailors see the dyers before going to the Belles. To get their breeches colored… They say the girls give it up for free to those in garish bloomers!
   1198256|00000000||Word is a witch lived up Lynx Crag, one who'd steal children, grind their bones to flour and bake gingerbread biscuits out of it!
   1183114|00000000||I wonder what they'll do now. Will they seek out a replacement duchess?
   1183110|00000000||What do you do with a drunken sailor…?
   1183112|00000000||Ehh, dundering devils…
   1183108|00000000||Vampires! I hate vampires!
   1198258|00000000||You've a bit of the nipple chafe, is that it? It's the only explanation for the nonsense you spew…
   1183122|00000000||Yeah?
   1183116|00000000||My regards.
   1183118|00000000||What sort of ruckus is this…? Guard! Help!
   1183120|00000000||Whoa there, Uncle Feelyfingers!
   1164668|00000000||Step into my parlor, my good sir! What brings you to Toussaint? Tell me.
   1164670|00000000||Hm. Let's call it business.
   1182114|00000000||Ah, then… a "professional journey." Nothing but work, tension, unfamiliar beds… One needs a way to relax atimes.
   1182116|00000000||Perhaps my girls could help you.
   1164673|00000000||Time I was on my way.
   1164683|00000000||Gotta go. See you later.
   1164679|00000000||Wanna let loose, enjoy myself…
   1164681|00000000||Of course. Talk to the girls - I'm certain they will do all in their power, and it's quite a lot, believe you me.
   1164671|00000000||Looking to relax, enjoy myself.
   1200258|00000000||Gwent - you play?
   1188515|00000000||Interested in the unusual, got a special request. Just, need to keep this between you and me.
   1200254|00000000||You know well I shouldn't… Eh, who cares. How might I help?
   1188513|00000000||You play gwent?
   1164672|00000000||Cozy place.
   1164675|00000000||Cozy place you got.
   1182181|00000000||I'm pleased you noticed.
   1164677|00000000||You see, when I had set aside enough to found my own establishment, I wished it to be not a bawdy house, but a bawdy home. A place where patrons would not simply come, drop their hose, then flee as soon as the girl rolled over.
   1182183|00000000||Here, the sheets do not reek of sweat, the beds have no bedbugs, and the wine is not watered down. It is a place where one longs to linger - to chat, sprawled in a comfortable chair, to light a pipe. All after paying a modest fee, of course…
   1164666|00000000||Welcome, welcome! So good to have you back.
   1208499|2b9f75ef||Di Salvaress' Guard
   1172524|00000000||Sweet Prophet Lebioda's saintly slippers. My tummy is thundering…
   1172522|00000000||Blistering belly buttons, I could go for a nibble…
   1172528|00000000||As famished as I am, are you?
   1172526|00000000||Brmph. Pardon, I hawked up some garlicky bile.
    532263|3ff15f20||Wealthy Townsman
   1211221|00000000||The witcher will hunt the Hare as well!
   1211223|00000000||Splendid idea!
   1211225|00000000||Positively avant-garde!
   1161414|00000000||Anarietta?!
   1161416|00000000||With some rogue?!
   1161418|00000000||Is this part of the game?
    532919|bc128740||Admirer
   1191822|00000000||I'd like to repay you, witcher, I would. But we've nothing!
   1176653|00000000||"His Grace the Duke expressed concern for his daughters…"
   1176715|00000000||"Mages sent by the Conclave arrived today. They came to examine Syanna."
   1176717|00000000||"I cannot know what conclusions they drew, but His Grace now seems clearly upset."
   1176719|00000000||Hm, Curse of the Black Sun - it was no doubt then that she was diagnosed with the syndrome's symptoms.
   1176721|00000000||Or had that label planted on her. It goes on - "I dared ask the duke what would become of the girl."
   1176723|00000000||"He did not reply."
   1176651|00000000||"Syanna gave me a drawing…"
   1176691|00000000||"Syanna gave me a drawing today…"
   1176693|00000000||Charming.
   1176695|00000000||"…of freshly decapitated bodies covered in blood."
   1176697|00000000||Perhaps not so much…
   1176699|00000000||"I asked her why ever she would draw such a thing. Her Highness claimed it was a rendering of nightmares which have plagued her for as long as she can remember. Syanna does wake up screaming nearly every night, save when she shares a bed with Anarietta."
   1176701|00000000||Curse of the Black Sun. Supposedly girls afflicted by it had horrible dreams. Kind of horrible that made some of 'em go mad.
   1176652|00000000||"The girls quarreled today…"
   1176703|00000000||"The girls quarreled today. I must note rather sadly they did not behave as befits future ladies. The incident devolved into fisticuffs."
   1176707|00000000||"Anna Henrietta was first to strike her sister. Syanna gave back as good as she'd gotten."
   1176709|00000000||"By the time I separated them, Anarietta had lost two teeth. She ran off to complain to her parents…"
   1176711|00000000||"His Grace the Duke refused to believe my version of events. He laid all the blame on Syanna and vowed to punish the little one harshly… Anarietta did her best to have her sister's sentence commuted, but the Duke and Duchess proved unbending."
   1176713|00000000||Tsk, tsk. Once you're labeled a black sheep, it's so hard to shed that reputation.
   1176654|00000000||"Their Nilfgaardian is dreadful, and they refuse to study…"
   1176725|00000000||"I tutored the girls in Nilfgaardian today…"
   1176733|00000000||"Syanna applies herself so, though she has great difficulty memorizing new vocabulary. Lady Anarietta seems more gifted in this regard, yet also prone to impish behavior."
   1176735|00000000||"When she thought me out of earshot, she called me a 'bloede kusse.' She and Syanna laughed so hard they almost choked."
   1176739|00000000||Hmm. "Bloede" is "damned" or "cursed." What's "kusse"?
   1179290|00000000||In the melodious tongue of our none too friendly neighbors to the south, the word describes the many-petaled flower that blooms in that place we so unmelodiously call the crotch.
   1176104|00000000||What the-? Found a notebook. "Property of Isabelle de Roquefort, Court Governess." The notes of Syanna and Anna Henrietta's governess. When they were little.
   1176649|00000000||I'm not sure it will help, but I suppose there's no harm in leafing through them.
   1176689|00000000||Hm. Realize this might sound improbable, but maybe, just maybe…. Anna Henrietta tossed Syanna into that illusion?
   1189824|00000000||Not impossible. She would be safe there… and isolated. We must see.
   1176655|00000000||Enough of that.
   1176650|00000000||"Today I visited the Land of a Thousand Fables for the first time…"
   1176659|00000000||"Today I accompanied the girls for the first time to the Land of a Thousand Fables. We spent half the day there."
   1176661|00000000||"First we played with Thumbelina, then with Barbarossa, who proved quite the charmer for a brigand and pirate."
   1176663|00000000||I'm beginning to suspect Isabelle de Roquefort wrote in her diary after taking a powerful hallucinogenic. Cannabis rudelaris, for instance, or…
   1176665|00000000||Shh! Don't interrupt.
   1176667|00000000||"I tip my cap to Master Artorius Vigo for his achievement. He has proved he has no equal in the arcane arts."
   1176669|00000000||Wait. Artorius was the court mage here, a specialist in illusions. Which means…
   1176671|00000000||Regis, last warning - stop interrupting, or I'll seat you in the corner.
   1176675|00000000||"The girls told me if I ever wished to visit alone, I need but crack open 'The Land of a Thousand Fables' and utter out loud the incantation 'Expecto ludum!'"
   1176677|00000000||A book as the key to an illusion. My, my, this grows more interesting by the minute.
   1176108|00000000||Where's that book…?
   1176330|00000000||Swear I saw that book somewhere…
   1183488|00000000||Kind of you to summon me. I thank you wholeheartedly.
   1175905|00000000||Here. The playroom's beyond this door.
   1183381|00000000||Beyond the door's the playroom. Found one of my brethren sniffing about. I made sure he'd stay out of our way.
   1176100|00000000||Miniature tableware… and plush toys. Cute.
   1200909|00000000||Nice tune.
   1200911|00000000||Indeed, pleasant. It's a shame the mechanism's damaged.
   1157240|00000000||Mirror, mirror on the wall… I despise these things.
   1183624|00000000||Locked. Hmm.
   1183439|00000000||Careful!
   1150804|00000000||Thanks.
   1150806|00000000||At your service.
   1183478|00000000||Well, well… a key tucked behind a picture.
   1176770|00000000||Regis, rather not have a fistfight with this door. Would you mind…?
   1150802|00000000||Not at all.
   1176685|00000000||Hm. Utter silence. No one here.
   1176687|00000000||We should look around at least.
   1154512|00000000||Shit… Probably meant to stand guard… at Anna Henrietta's personal request.
   1176096|00000000||Wooden duck. Somebody broke its wings off.
   1157242|00000000||A rocking horse. Rather worn. I suppose it got a lot of use…
   1164981|00000000||Something inside? Nope - empty.
   1176098|00000000||A tin knight.
   1164977|00000000||Nothing under the carpet.
   1164979|00000000||Did you expect something? Apart from the dust swept under there by a lazy chambermaid?
   1150790|00000000||Locked… Of course.
   1205830|198611fe||Percival
   1196241|00000000||Ha-hah, heh, heh, hello.
   1196245|00000000||Shit.
   1196247|00000000||Aaaah!
   1165460|00000000||Leave me alone, darnit!
   1165458|00000000||Clever man, is that it? Bog off!
   1165462|00000000||I've just about had enough of this…
   1165464|00000000||What are you staring at, graylocks?
   1189657|00000000||Hahah! A bosom in the hand's worth four on a wench! Heheheh!
   1189659|00000000||Feast till the wine barrels run dry! There is no tomorrow!
   1189663|00000000||Ritbug! Centennial foot and crabs!
   1189661|00000000||All the portents… All the omens…
   1195608|00000000||Oy!
   1195610|00000000||Di, di, di… No… sss, di, di…
   1195685|00000000||That's just foolish, mate.
   1195614|00000000||Bloody hell!
   1195616|00000000||Akh akh akh…
   1195618|00000000||We can't kill him!
   1195620|00000000||Yeeeeaaa?
   1195628|00000000||Shut your trap, will you? Got a monster hangover.
   1195622|00000000||He's hexin'!
   1195624|00000000||Nooo!
   1195687|00000000||Fuck, fine, stand and fight!
   1195689|00000000||Mh. There.
    543164|d10c8bcd||Roach
   1154552|00000000||The witcher had, at last, defeated the Beast of Beauclair. Her Enlightened Highness Duchess Anna Henrietta invited him to a ceremony where she would award him the Vitis Vinifera Medal, Toussaint's highest honor.<br>Geralt, famous for being one of the world's leading scruffs, possessed no outfit that would not violate protocol or be remotely suitable for such an occasion. In her generosity, the duchess agreed to fund a new robe.<br>Regis, having nothing better to do, accompanied the witcher to the tailor's for his fitting. There, the vampire revealed the thought that was tormenting him. Namely, he believed Syanna had planned five murders from the start. He wished to know the identity of the fifth intended victim. He suggested to Geralt that they investigate the matter to the end.<br>
   1154553|00000000||They first sought out the bootblack. The boy directed them to a poorhouse. It was there they learned Syanna had indeed planned five murders. All to wreak vengeance upon those who had caused her to be banished from the court and the Ducal Palace. The final victim was to have been her very own sister, Duchess Anna Henrietta.<br>Geralt considered confronting Syanna.<br>
   1154554|00000000||Geralt reached the tower where Syanna sat confined. After speaking to her, he made his way to the ceremony, during which he was to receive his distinction.<br>
   1154555|00000000||On her own behalf and that of her subjects, Anna Henrietta thanked Geralt for slaying the Beast of Beauclair and awarded him the Vitis Vinifera Medal. Thankfully, the ceremony was brief, so the witcher lacked time to demonstrate his ignorance of protocol and thus violate the majesty of the court.<br>
   1154625|00000000||After the ceremony, Sylvia Anna faced her accusers. Alas, her interrogation ended in tragedy. Though her murderous scheme had been thwarted when her "murder weapon," the vampire Dettlaff, had been removed, Syanna decided to see the matter through. Feigning a willingness to reconcile, she tricked all those present and ran a hair pin through her sister's heart. Anarietta died instantly, and no one, not even the witcher with his lightning fast reflexes, could prevent it. <br>A woman of great beauty, in the prime of her life, Anna Henrietta breathed her last at the foot of her own palace. As she died her thoughts went to the undersigned… Grief grips my heart as I write this, tears flow of their own from my eyes.<br>The bad seed, Sylvia Anna, perished immediately afterwards, without trial or due process cut down by a ducal guardsman loyal and true.<br>
   1154626|00000000||After the ceremony, Sylvia Anna faced her accusers. When Geralt had spoken to Syanna earlier, he had broached some sensitive issues. These now came to the fore, and a heated argument erupted between the sisters. Those valuing convention and decorum undoubtedly considered it an unsavory public airing of matters private. Yet my own heart inclines me to think it a fortunate turn of events. For we cannot know what might have happened had there been no release of resentments that had accumulated over decades.<br>Upon quitting the palace Geralt rejoined Regis at his crypt. They indulged in some well-deserved respite while sipping Regis' exquisite (as they both assured me) mandrake hooch.<br>
   1208591|00000000||Geralt visited the crypt where both sisters had been laid to rest. Then he rejoined Regis to enjoy some well-deserved respite, aided by a jug of the vampire's mandrake hooch.<br>
   1154471|00000000||Talk to Damien.
   1187711|00000000||Place a flower on Anna Henrietta's grave.
   1154472|00000000||[Optional] Talk to the bootblack during the day.
   1154473|00000000||[Optional] Talk to Syanna.
   1172746|00000000||[Optional] Find the shelter.
   1172761|00000000||Defeat the attackers.
   1189400|00000000||[Optional] Follow the guard to Syanna's cell.

   1206895|c09e5792||Trentin
   1153679|00000000||Why should I trust you?
   1153685|00000000||Why should I trust you?
   1153687|00000000||A word once given I always keep.
   1153689|00000000||Now begone, leave me be. I can tend to the rest alone.
   1153691|00000000||Remember the deal we made.
   1153693|00000000||I have given you my word, I will keep it. Adieu.
   1153681|00000000||Hold you to that. Daphne didn't deserve her fate.
   1153683|00000000||Tales can be cruel.
   1153678|00000000||Agreed.
   1150964|00000000||You have bested me. Tradition ordains I must grant you three wishes it seems.
   1150966|00000000||You know exactly why I'm here.
   1153634|00000000||Very well, I will help you. Albeit I pity the lass not at all, I shall do what I can to break the curse that imprisons her soul in the tree.
   1153434|00000000||Thought you'd save her, at least try.
   1153436|00000000||It cannot be done. I know my magic, its limits, and I know when I face a force more powerful than spells.
   1161941|00000000||Hm…
   1126745|00000000||Hmm. A wall of spell enhancements. Or trophies.
   1131170|00000000||[Examine doll.]
   1131176|00000000||Doll looks like an accessory… for casting curses.
   1131171|00000000||[Examine arrow.]
   1131178|00000000||Arrow, broken in half. No doubt to bring bad luck to the archer.
   1131173|00000000||[Examine branch.]
   1131182|00000000||Branch off a grapevine. Could be to ensure a good harvest, or a bad one.
   1131174|00000000||[Examine kerchief.]
   1157985|00000000||Silk kerchief, monogrammed "D.F." Hm, could use it to break the curse if it's Daphne's.
   1137837|00000000||None but feral cats stray in here most oft, yet it seems I've a guest, from afar, at that. What do you seek in my home?
   1137839|00000000||Already found it.
   1137841|00000000||You do not aim to lift the curse from the tree girl, do you?
   1137843|00000000||What if I do?
   1137845|00000000||Then you had best know you waste your time.
   1137847|00000000||The old tales - did your nan not tell them to you? Even I, the witch of Lynx Crag, would be hard pressed to overcome the power of love and longing.
   1152546|00000000||What happened to Sir Gareth, the knight?
   1152548|00000000||The lady's knight - he ever make it here?
   1152550|00000000||Sir Gareth? Yes. He came to sway me, but had a quick change of heart. To be precise, it came after the first night we spent together.
   1152560|00000000||He stayed a fair while. Then his conscience got the better of him, and he resolved to return to his beloved.
   1152562|00000000||Might've resolved to. But never made it.
   1152564|00000000||A tragic fate befell him along the way.
   1152566|00000000||You have anything to do with this turn of fate?
   1152568|00000000||Of course. Was I to let another woman have a man who belonged to me? Hmph.  I could not abide it.
   1153418|00000000||Can lift the curse myself.
   1194776|00000000||Not about to trust you. With a lock of my hair or anything else.
   1192211|00000000||No chance. You'll lift the curse from the tree because I say so.
   1150869|00000000||Lift the curse, or else.
   1153417|00000000||I'll make you do it.
   1137861|00000000||Refuse to help me, and I'll make you regret it… and force you to.
   1137863|00000000||Do you know what really makes my blood boil? Bluster, threats, especially beneath my own roof.
   1152543|00000000||Wouldn't need to use either if you'd cooperate.
   1152545|00000000||How would I do that given you will soon be dead?
   1192220|00000000||Akhan daal!
   1192212|00000000||No chance. I'll manage on my own.
   1150954|00000000||I'll handle the curse myself, without your help.
   1150956|00000000||Go right ahead. I wish you luck.
   1150958|00000000||Letting me go? Just like that?
   1152556|00000000||I could not have devised a better ending for this little tale.
   1163810|00000000||Our visit is done. Adieu, for never shall we meet again.
   1137848|00000000||Can lift the curse myself.
   1137849|00000000||Just lift the curse. Please?
   1150871|00000000||What if I asked you nicely? To lift the curse, please.
   1150873|00000000||Gareth met the fate he deserved, and what happened to his wench was not my fault.
   1153348|00000000||All right, so you didn't cast the curse. But could you help lift it?
   1153407|00000000||I probably could. But why ever would I?
   1153416|00000000||I'll humble myself.
   1153420|00000000||I'll humble myself, prostrate myself before you like the Gareth of the tale did.
   1153423|00000000||I beseech you to help me. Lift the curse that imprisoned Daphne in the tree.
   1153425|00000000||When I saw you enter my hut, I thought, "Now there is a fellow who shall bend his neck for no one."
   1156361|00000000||Stand.
   1153427|00000000||None, not even I, can restore to the lass the years she has lost, can erase the suffering she has endured.
   1153429|00000000||We cannot bring her back to life, but I shall tell you how you might let her depart in peace. Yet my aid shall have its price - a lock of your hair.
   1179784|00000000||Hm. How can I know you won't use it to cast a spell on me?
   1179786|00000000||I require this, I must, for with it I will cast a spell to conceal me from you for all time, and will use it for nothing else. You will nag me never again. And you've nothing to fear, I assure you, I always keep my word.
   1153431|00000000||Fine. Got a deal.
   1194971|00000000||I'll trust you, against my better judgment. Lock of my hair's yours.
   1194973|00000000||Splendid.
   1150894|00000000||What do I need to do?
   1150896|00000000||You must convince the maiden her beloved yearned to return but perished in the attempt.
   1153409|00000000||Take her silk kerchief and a fragment of Gareth's remains. His bones lie bleaching in the cave beneath this rock.
   1150927|00000000||Fire must consume the kerchief and remains. And remember, your heart, your intentions must be pure. Clear?
   1153413|00000000||Yeah. Thanks for your help.
   1153415|00000000||You are welcome. And adieu - once you walk out that door, never shall we meet again.
   1150898|00000000||Got a bone of his already.
   1153411|00000000||Doubtless taken as a professional precaution. Good.
   1150960|00000000||You win! I yield!
   1158019|00000000||Go see to your maiden.
   1163348|00000000||Simmer down, friend.

   1204918|00000000||Following what can only be described as a surprising turn of events, the witcher had no choice but to report to the duchess. He needed to inform her that the hunt for the Beast would be no ordinary monster hunt. Fully aware of the fiery temperament of Anarietta, Toussaint's gracious ruler, Geralt was justified in thinking the meeting would not be among the most pleasant he had ever had…<br>
   1204919|00000000||Geralt managed to sway the duchess' conviction - she agreed that he would, for now, forgo tracking the vampire and focus instead on locating whoever held the vampire in thrall. He had some leads already. These prompted him to go to the ducal vineyard of Castel Ravello. For it was the source of the famed Sangreal, a wine only ever served at the Ducal Palace to the noblest guests to come to court, including - not to boast - the undersigned. And I will be candid - I've had better. Yet it seemed at the time that whoever was blackmailing the vampire had acquired a taste for Sangreal specifically. Thus the witcher and the duchess set out to inspect the vineyard in the hope of finding another lead.<br>
   1204920|00000000||The witcher's suspicions had proved true - Sangreal seemed indeed to be the key to finding the blackmailer. The steward of Castel Ravello admitted he had sold a barrel of the wine to a Cintrian nobleman. The witcher and a unit of ducal guardsmen decided to wait in ambush for said connoisseur…<br>
   1204921|00000000||Alas, the Cintrian proved a notch too clever. When Geralt attempted to deliver the second barrel of wine, the nobleman was nowhere in sight. Some hired thugs found themselves caught in the ambush, and the witcher thrashed them heroically with the aid of his escort of guardsmen. The single captured rogue, when questioned, confirmed the bandits' leader was indeed the mysterious Cintrian, who was said to be hiding somewhere in Toussaint.<br>
   1204933|00000000||While investigating, the witcher had learned the Cintrian was not working alone. He stood at the head of a well-organized group of brigands. It was still not clear that the nobleman himself was Dettlaff's blackmailer. Yet even were he to prove merely an intermediary in the scheme, it was likely he would know where to find those directly responsible.<br>
   1186205|00000000||Report to the duchess about your hunt for the Beast.

   1200685|00000000||During his stay in Toussaint, Geralt became involved with a curious case of gynodendromorphy – that is to say, a woman who had been turned into a tree. When one cut into this tree’s bark, it bled, and when the wind blew through its leaves, one could hear muffled sobs. Geralt investigated the matter and learned magic (or possibly a curse) was responsible for the transformation, and it surely had something to do with a certain sad episode from the woman’s past. The love of Daphne’s life, a knight errant, had gone to the witch of Lynx Crag and never returned, leaving her to wait for him forever, filled with sadness and longing.<br>
   1212245|00000000||Our hero decided to undo Daphne’s transformation himself, but this did not end well. The shock of being freed from her tree-prison was too much for Daphne and she became a crazed and incredibly dangerous wraith. Geralt had no choice but to banish her from this earth. He struck down the wraith with a heavy heart, yet knew only this would bring her peace.
   1212246|00000000||Our hero visited the witch and decided to force her to disenchant the woman stuck in the tree, but this did not end well. The witch freed Daphne, but the shock was too much for her tortured soul. Daphne’s crazed soul turned out to be highly dangerous. It possessed the first living being it came across, a dog, then killed Jacob the woodcutter. Geralt put an end to the wraith’s rampage by killing the possessed hound and walked away with a heavy heart, ruing the fate of woman, woodcutter and dog alike.

   1138441|00000000||I know now the two teams' rosters. I shall be captain of ours. That means you shall do as I say for the duration of the fight. Is this clear?
   1195180|00000000||Palmerin de Launfal will lead the opposing team.
   1195182|00000000||With this skirmish we commemorate the Battle of Fox Hollow of 1218, when a hanse of southern outlaws led by Hallar the Brown attacked Toussaint only to be driven off by brave knights, thus setting a precedent.
   1195184|00000000||Since that day knights errant have guarded the duchy's borders. Palmerin drew the short straw, so his team shall play the barbarian Hallar's men. Any questions?
   1195186|00000000||None.
   1138447|00000000||I doubt you will do us any good. You know nothing of knightly combat as a witcher. Try at least to stay out of our way.
   1138445|00000000||If you swing your blade as deftly as you shoot, we shall win. Good luck.
   1138472|00000000||It is time, gentlemen. Take your weapons and proceed to the arena.
   1170522|00000000||A cheer for the knights, the ladies, the lords! For our next entertainment, the teams shall cross swords!
   1172996|00000000||Two rival crews, two coteries, shall fight, full tilt, till one's dropped to its knees.
   1204870|00000000||Who virtue ignores or lands blows unclean, shall forever be branded as shameful, obscene.
   1182610|00000000||While the knights prepare, let me say I'm elated, to behold such a crowd, on edge, breath bated!
   1204878|00000000||Whoever here wins the past champion shall face - all others must leave, heads bowed in disgrace.
   1128521|00000000||Let us begin! Crowd, raise a ruckus! Blood, sweat and tears shall soon follow in buckets!
   1170853|00000000||Alone Geralt stands, alone he fights on - but inside does he weep for those who have gone?
   1170855|00000000||Now there's but Ravix, though he's far from done. When all the dust clears, shall he have won?
   1171036|00000000||Oh me, oh my, that must have been painful! Like a thorn to the heart, only more baneful!
   1189673|00000000||Witcher! Save us from the Beast!
   1189677|00000000||Did you see them?! The vampeers?!
   1189679|00000000||Nightmare upon nightmare! First the vampeer attack, now the duquessa's death…
   1189675|00000000||Akh akh… Blazes, my cough's back.
   1189681|00000000||No! No… akh akh! Please!
   1198792|00000000||Ehh, what goes on in that head of yours?
   1198794|00000000||Gee-golly, akh akh! Golly-gee!
   1198798|00000000||That witcher got heaps of gold for killing the Beast. So much he could buy Castel Ravello! Akh akh!
   1201219|00000000||Instead of hunting the Beast, that witcher's been at the tourney. Bashing shields with the knights. I suppose he forgot he's here to save us?!
   1198800|00000000||The witcher got rid of the Beast, but the duquessa balked at paying him. She got a severe tongue-lashing! In front all her ministers! That's why the witcher landed in prison!
   1189687|00000000||Well, what do you want?
   1189683|00000000||Greetings!
   1189685|00000000||Don't you tread on me!

   1184471|00000000||Our tale of diagrams for grandmaster level gear of the School of the Griffin is a sad one. But so be it, as not all tales need be happy. If you are curious to read on, you should start by knowing that it began long ago, when a certain witcher was summoned to Fort Ussar.<br>
   1184472|00000000||This witcher's name was Jerome, and the monster contract dangled before him had been nothing but a pretext designed to lure him. For Jerome's father had simply decided he wanted his son back, a son who had turned his back on his parents. The problem lay in the fact that Jerome had despised his father, who was a cruel madman despite claiming to have only the best intentions. Their meeting did not end well for either, and though in discovering its nature Geralt managed to assemble a full set of School of the Griffin grandmaster level diagrams, he could not help but recall a grim adage - that good intentions did, indeed, pave hell's floor.<br>

   1184469|00000000||Witchers of the School of the Bear are stereotypically thought of as much like their animal patron - in other words, hefty and hairy. Though stereotypes oft prove divorced from realities, when Geralt happened on the trail of some diagrams of grandmaster level gear from the School of the Bear, upon closer investigation he learned he was, in fact, on the trail of just such a beefy and shaggy colleague. This burly Bear had years ago taken on a contract at the Tufo Vineyard. He had disappeared soon after, along with the diagrams he had claimed to have.<br>
   1184470|00000000||The Bear had evidently overestimated his own strength. This would not have been a problem had it not occurred while he was tracking a beast in a complex of caves. Geralt found the witcher's remains as well as his diagrams.<br>

   1207656|00000000||Foek heil! Get away!
   1207658|00000000||What beasts are these…?!
   1207660|00000000||Leave me be!
   1188727|00000000||Oh, you bleeding bumbotcher!
   1198711|00000000||Sheesh, there's no chance that's true.
   1198709|00000000||Just plum lovely! What a tale!
   1188733|00000000||You've a house. Might it perhaps be time to find a wife?
   1188735|00000000||Geralt! Come here, let me give you a kiss, you dashing young thing!
   1200501|00000000||You know, Master Liam, Maid Matilda… something tells me it's not just a new vintage they'll be putting out soon…
   1198905|00000000||Those Vermentino rats've got reesty diddlesacks! Among other things!
   1188731|00000000||I've a daughter, you know… She's fit to wed, oh so fit…
   1188729|00000000||A witcher - we could use one around here! Full-time!
   1188737|00000000||What the bluthers has got in your head?!
   1198717|00000000||The witcher cut down all the prowlers! That's what folk say! Fourfingers, Starling Straggen, Loth Halfbreed - the whole lot!
   1198715|00000000||Folk claim the witcher has a mind to cull all the hanses. After all, if he did one in, he'll do in the others, no problem!
   1198713|00000000||They say the duchess commanded a pair of shaelmaars captured for the tourney. Then, during transport, one fled, dug down deep and got away!
   1188741|00000000||Greetings!
   1188739|00000000||Good health to you.
   1177612|00000000||Ehh, what is it?
   1177616|00000000||Agh, life is hard!
   1177614|00000000||Bleeding lumbago. I did not get a wink last night…
   1177618|00000000||Blumbering bumbotchers, I cannot keep my eyes open.
   1194143|00000000||Ah. Me poor noggin'.
   1194145|00000000||Mouth's dry as stockfish.
   1211022|cb7a6e33||Tailor
   1193362|00000000||Darlin'!
   1193358|00000000||I love you.
   1193360|00000000||Aaaaaargh!
   1179200|00000000||Ramming twoots and busting heads - that is what I like!
   1179202|00000000||Come, now, codger… take a breath!
   1179198|00000000||Now, did you have to go and tweak our noses?
   1053421|eadb132d||Servant
   1193835|00000000||Greetings.
   1193837|00000000||Greetings to you and your family.
   1193839|00000000||Watch where you step.
   1193841|00000000||Don't be unreasonable!
   1193843|00000000||No! I don't want to die…
   1193845|00000000||Eeeh.
   1187578|00000000||I swear on the heron! Better to praise the names of you fair damsels, I vow to disembowel ten predatory bandits before Yule!
   1194798|00000000||You are brave, sir knight. But Sir Aurelian has already sworn to shorten fifteen highwaymen by a head in the same time.
   1194801|00000000||Whereas Sir Gabriel vowed to kill a manticore in my honor and bring its venomous tail as proof.
   1194803|00000000||Then… then I shall slay three manticores for you, my Lady! Before Yule! On my honor!
   1172622|00000000||*Sniff* Clear scent of perfume.
   1172624|00000000||Let's follow it. No time to lose.
   1185576|00000000||We should walk past the tables, perhaps they're still there.
   1185574|00000000||Let's look by the refreshments.
   1197701|00000000||Someone left their lute behind. Looks a little like Dandelion's…
   1197703|00000000||His was scratched… someone beat him with it once.
   1189192|00000000||No time for such antics. Come on.
   1189188|00000000||Geralt, we haven't the time, come…
   1189190|00000000||Get out of the water, we've no time to lose.
   1185580|00000000||Let's not waste time.
   1185578|00000000||Lead on, witcher.
   1185572|00000000||Come, let's look in the alcoves.
   1185570|00000000||She ought to be in one of the alcoves.
   1197705|00000000||Hm. Love letter penned on a napkin… Look.
   1197707|00000000||"O, my amour, my sunbeam flittering 'cross the firmament of my life…" Treacly refuse.
   1197709|00000000||Hit of fisstech. Artists' way of numbing their existential pain.
   1197711|00000000||I do not even wish to comment…
   1173191|00000000||Empty heart-shaped box… Cecilia must've left it behind.
   1173193|00000000||It looks like it held a flask of perfume.
   1184204|00000000||A gift from the Cintrian, I imagine…
   1184206|00000000||Scent still hangs in the air. Let's follow it.
   1200347|00000000||Come back, we must find the Cintrian.
   1200343|00000000||Geralt, where are you going? We've a job to do.
   1205778|00000000||Not here.
   1205780|00000000||We must look around. Perhaps we'll find a clue.
   1171794|00000000||And? What now?
   1171792|00000000||Bah…
   1171798|00000000||Sweet Prophet Lebioda's toes! Where am I?
   1171796|00000000||Fiddlesticks, I'm lost.
   1201498|00000000||Snuggling up to a bottle of Butcher of Blaviken takes as much courage as tackling a beast….
   1209410|00000000||Best cure for the Beast? A witcher!
   1209408|00000000||The Guard brings peace to our domains - flout its writ and rot in chains!
   1209406|00000000||Geralt! I knew from the start you'd best the Beast!
   1209412|00000000||All together, now!
   1209416|00000000||Seems you're but a dog's dingle berry, witcher!
   1209418|00000000||Toussaint!
   1209420|00000000||Lock him up! And swallow the key!
   1209414|00000000||For the duquessa!
   1209422|00000000||Darnit, watch where you step, fool!
   1209424|00000000||Spells! Magic!
   1209426|00000000||Deep breath, witcher.
   1209428|00000000||Courage, men!
   1209430|00000000||Witcher…
   1209432|00000000||Witchcraft! Spells!
   1209434|00000000||You asked for it!
   1209436|00000000||That's what I like to see!
   1209440|00000000||Geralt! Well met!
   1209438|00000000||Well? Will you stay long?
   1157557|f696e2f5||Witch of Lynx Crag
   1172650|00000000||Yes, good sir?
   1172648|00000000||Greetings.
   1195630|00000000||Was it you who saved our colleague, Jean-Louis Ludovic? Hats off!
   1172652|00000000||Combing! Pomading! Cheap and thorough!
   1172654|00000000||Curl permanentation! Hair rejuvenation! Dandruff annihilation!
   1172655|00000000||Careful, or I will cut you crooked!
   1172657|00000000||Lebioda's lamentations!
   1124365|00000000||Welcome to Cianfanelli Bank, where we look after your coin as if it were our own, et cetera, et cetera… How can I help you, sir?
   1135480|00000000||Need a document - Permit A38.
   1135482|00000000||This A38 permit… In a bit of a hurry, see? There any way we could speed this up?
   1135484|00000000||Does the gentleman believe the rules do not apply to him and he may resolve things "under the table"…? Well, if so, he's mistaken.
   1170391|00000000||Can you tell me where I can do it, then?
   1170401|00000000||Happen to know where I can do it, then?
   1170403|00000000||Hmm. Let me think…
   1177407|00000000||Be back later.
   1105955|00000000||Come back later.
   1105957|00000000||As you wish, sir.
   1097621|00000000||Farewell.
   1124357|00000000||Perhaps upstairs? In records? Or downstairs in the archive? You must ask them, sir.
   1135235|00000000||Do just that.
   1170393|00000000||Whaddaya mean, "wrong window"?! I was told I'd get Permit A38 here.
   1170395|00000000||Please remain calm, sir, or you'll rupture a vein.
   1170397|00000000||So just tell me where I get this stupid document.
   1170390|00000000||What do you mean, "wrong window"?
   1170387|00000000||I'd like to reactivate my account so I need a copy of Permit A38.
   1170389|00000000||Wrong window, I fear.
   1097617|00000000||Permit A38 - need a copy.
   1168769|00000000||Need Form 202.
   1178412|00000000||I need Form 202.
   1178414|00000000||I believe I was clear, sir. There's nothing I can do.
   1124465|00000000||Need Form 202 to get a copy of Permit A38. D'you know that? Couldn't have told me? Wasted a lot of time because of you.
   1124467|00000000||Please, sir. There's no need to lose your temper. I thought it obvious and thus needed no stating. The form will soon be ready. Name and surname?
   1135251|00000000||Geralt of Rivia.
   1170362|00000000||Let me find it… Gedon… Gemmel… Here it is – Geralt of Rivia.
   1170364|00000000||Sorry, sir, I cannot issue Form 202.
   1170366|00000000||Excuse me?
   1170368|00000000||The applicant in question has been declared dead. Officially. Now, do tell me, sir - how am I to enter that into the ledger?
   1170625|00000000||[Give perfume.]
   1170636|00000000||Like musky aromas, right?
   1170638|00000000||And how would you know that, sir?
   1170640|00000000||Smelled it *Sniff*… when you walked by. That scent you wear… lovely.
   1178418|00000000||So I thought to myself… bet she'll like this, too.
   1170642|00000000||Oh, but I… I shouldn't, really…
   1178420|00000000||Please accept it. As a token of my thanks for your help with my file.
   1170634|00000000||Oh my… you, sir, are quite the charmer…
   1178416|00000000||Ah, please wait a moment. I shall fetch Master Cianfanelli. Perhaps he'll arrange something that excludes the paperwork.
   1178410|00000000||Got you some flowers. Just a thank you… for helping me with my file.
   1170644|00000000||Oh, but I… I shouldn't… For me, really?
   1170646|00000000||Match the color of your eyes.
   1170624|00000000||[Give flowers.]
   1170626|00000000||Tell you the truth, I'm really just here to see you.
   1168773|00000000||Gotta admit something before I go, though. Had an ulterior motive for coming here.
   1168775|00000000||What… motive?
   1168777|00000000||To enjoy a bit of conversation with you. It's probably why I'll come back, then come back again…
   1168779|00000000||Until the day you give me a smile. That moment, that's what I'm waiting for.

The mandible had been torn off. Seeing this, Sergeant Dovate vomited profusely and the administration of smelling salts was required. The investigation has been discontinued and the deed attributed to a supernatural being.</i> <br>– fragment of a Toussaint Ducal Guard report<br><br>Fleders are classified as lesser vampires. Though weaker than the rest of their ilk in every aspect from the physiomagic to the physiognomic, they should not be underestimated – for they are very, very dangerous. Fleders cannot be mistaken for any other creature, with their wide, toothy jaws, flat, unpleasant faces and completely hairless, often warty bodies. These vampires mainly fight with their teeth and claws, flailing them blindly and not stopping even when their victim is already dead. Even a solitary fleder is strong enough to take down a trained soldier.<br><br>Compared to other vampires, fleders display meager intelligence, seen most clearly in the mindless rage which causes them to try with all their might to attack and tear to shreds any weaker being.<br>
   1208894|00000000||When fighting fleders, it is best to take advantage of their particular method of movement. These creatures do not run, but they do try to catch their prey and knock it over by leaping. Knowing this behavior, one can plan the fight appropriately and not let oneself be caught by surprise.<br><br>They are vulnerable to vampire oil as well as Black Blood.

   1213761|00000000||The third of the lost transports had gone missing somewhere in the nearby wilds. The area had a history of folk disappearing - after entering the woods, they would fail ever to return. Geralt could not help but expect the worst.
   1213762|00000000||A monster had beset the workers traveling to the building site. Geralt first dealt with the spriggan and then sought out the workers in a cavern where they had hidden from the beast.<br>
   1214140|00000000||No one abandons his cart without good cause. When Geralt happened across just such a cast off means of transport during his travels, he decided to learn more about what had become of its erstwhile owners.
   1214141|00000000||It seemed the caravan had been attacked by a spriggan. The workers who had been traveling with it managed to escape and had taken shelter in a cave. Geralt killed the monster and saved the lives of the workers, who it turned out were builders helping erect the statue of the Prophet Lebioda.
   1212713|00000000||Investigate the tracks around the abandoned wagons.
   1212717|00000000||Follow the workers' tracks.
   1212721|00000000||Kill the spriggan.
   1212895|00000000||Investigate the cave entrance.

   1125024|00000000||Mhm.
   1125026|00000000||Hm, hm.
   1125044|00000000||Hmm…
   1178805|00000000||Ptooey. Right! Let's dance!
   1195053|00000000||He's the one who killed Filibert Fourfingers!
   1178807|00000000||You! Freak!
   1178809|00000000||You're quick! But not nearly quick enough.
   1178811|00000000||Gray tush, gray tush…
   1178813|00000000||Don't let him catch his breath!
   1178815|00000000||Have at him!
   1178817|00000000||Pumpernickel!
   1178819|00000000||Some kind of mage!
   1178082|00000000||Whose notion of order is this? Why doesn't someone do something?
   1178086|00000000||What's this about?
   1153652|00000000||I am. Don't think I've seen your notice, though.
   1110836|00000000||Not to fret. I shall tell you, and perhaps you'd care to help - not free of charge, naturally. The din at the city cemetery - that's my grief.
   1153654|00000000||Screaming and clattering fill the air at night. A man can't get a lick of sleep. It all began on the day of Saint Zoatham's Remembrance. I recall it precisely.
   1110820|00000000||Fine. I'll tend to it. Any victims, someone go missing recently? Or are we just talking noises?
   1110828|00000000||No one's come to harm, thank the gods. Why, do you think it might be a monster?
   1178176|00000000||Could be, but doesn't need to, though. Might also be grave robbers, tramps. Remains to be seen.
   1153696|00000000||I can't rightly say what would be worse. Whatever the case, gods speed, master!
   1110795|00000000||I'll tend to it.
   1160771|00000000||Hm, I don't believe I have that amount… What would you say to a festival discount? On account of the… uhh… tourney?
   1160767|00000000||What?! Much too much!
   1160773|00000000||Agreed!
   1160777|00000000||You must be off your noggin! Thoroughly!
   1162608|00000000||How much'll I get for this?
   1162610|00000000||How much… Yaaawn… would you like?
   1160759|00000000||How much're you offering?
   1110830|00000000||Sorry, can't help you.
   1110832|00000000||Then why the devils bother me at all? Argh.
   1110796|00000000||Can't help you, either.
   1120856|00000000||Noises occur regularly?
   1120858|00000000||The noises - they pretty regular?
   1121452|00000000||Each night! I live next door, I hear it loud and clear. As if through a horn someone had stuck in my ear.
   1121461|00000000||"Arrghh! Haaaawk! Whoooo! Feeeeeerrkk!", and then WHAAACK! THUD! As if a mother bear slammed pate-first into a cupboard.
   1121463|00000000||Know exactly what you mean.
   1151231|00000000||Hrrrmmm… Wha--? Oh. It's you.
   1178168|00000000||You return.
   1178170|00000000||Conscience been gnawing at you? Have you decided to help with the ruckus at the cemetery after all?
   1110794|00000000||I took the matter up with the Ducal Guard. They claim they found nothing, but I'm not sure they even bothered to look. What's left for me to do? Should I sniff about the cemetery myself?
   1110770|00000000||Noises at the cemetery - you the one they bother?
   1110772|00000000||Yes, yes! And I'm alone in that, it seems! That is, no one else has bothered to take any steps, though all must hear the racket.
   1178102|00000000||Ah… the notice, is that it? Are you a witcher, master?
   1153641|00000000||Wh-wha? Wha's gwin' on?
   1178084|00000000||Pretty crap idea, sleeping at the Clogs. Unless you don't mind some clever little beast making off with your coin pouch.
   1163595|00000000||Took care of it.
   1163597|00000000||Truly? The howling's gone? For good? Wonderful. Ah, to sleep in my own bed again, at long last!
   1164180|00000000||But, but… what was it? Some ancient filth entombed deep in the catacombs?
   1110879|00000000||Yeah. Tough job, barely survived.
   1110895|00000000||Yeah. Really tough, demanding fight. Barely made it out alive.
   1110976|00000000||Is it your codex? Forbids you from revealing the details? For the best, I daresay. There's a small premium for you. You've earned it.
   1110971|00000000||Nope. Just a marital spat.
   1110973|00000000||That's it? But they hollered like skewered polecats. Hrmph, sorry to bother you with such a trifle. Here, for your trouble.
   1110975|00000000||Thanks.
   1110878|00000000||Actually, just a marital spat.
   1110847|00000000||Hey there, I'm done. Cemetery oughta be real nice and quiet now.
   1110849|00000000||Ahh, to sleep in my own bed once more! The Clogs has grown intolerably loud. The punters bellow like men possessed!
   1121685|00000000||One madman especially - always shouting "Odrin, Ooodrin!" But tell me, at the cemetery, what was it? Beasts, as you claimed?
   1097368|00000000||Hrrrrmm… Hrmmm… Ugh, quiet down, now, shhh…
   1154692|00000000||Sooo? Done with the job? Nooo? Then lemme be…
   1154694|00000000||Ahhh, calm and quiet, at last.
   1192654|00000000||And? Is it done?

   1172961|00000000||A wild flash fills one man's eyes, through another's veins hot blood flies…
   1172959|00000000||At thunderous speed with lances they strike, many a knight will not leave with his life…
   1172963|00000000||Anything bothering you?
   1172965|00000000||My, you're quite pale.
   1161038|00000000||We've no time to lose!
   1184975|00000000||Wee Willie Witcher runs through the town, upstairs and downstairs, in his night gown!
   1184977|00000000||What happened to your head?
   1184973|00000000||Hey! Don't you step on me!
   1184981|00000000||Don't you bother me!
   1184979|00000000||I don't know you!
   1194450|00000000||What is it?
   1194452|00000000||Now where'd you get them catty peepers?
   1197861|00000000||With that cognac from the Monnart Brothers, they say hangovers are a thing of the past! Drink it all night and you'll wake up the next morn twice as strong!
   1197863|00000000||The drunken Maestro's sobered up! Gray-haired witcher bopped him so hard, he knocked him right back on the wagon!
   1197859|00000000||The Nilfgaardians fear the Beast so bad, they've shut their embassy, don't let anyone in - not even their own merchants who've come here to trade!
   1183094|00000000||Farewell and adieu, to you, Beauclair ladies… Farewell and adieu, to you, maids of Toussaint!
   1183096|00000000||And we'll drink and be merry, and drown melancholy, singing here's to the health of each Toussaint-born lass!
   1183098|00000000||You're brave, witcher. That, or you don't like your head enough to want to keep it.
   1183092|00000000||What'd you do to get our duquessa so hopping mad, eh?
   1197867|00000000||Yeah! Heard the same, I did.
   1197865|00000000||Piddlewash. Though… could it be true?
   1183106|00000000||Hey! Ho!
   1183100|00000000||Greetings.
   1183102|00000000||Oh, mate, it seems you've gone all muddled in the mind!
   1183104|00000000||Would you mind apologizing?!
   1144591|00000000||What?
   1144589|00000000||The commander, he's the one you want.
   1144593|00000000||Your weapon - put it away.
   1144599|00000000||Rumpelstiltskinflint!
   1144597|00000000||Long live Duchess Anna Henrietta!
   1144595|00000000||This shall not take long…
   1144603|00000000||This is Beauclair, not some flea-ridden province!
   1144601|00000000||The duchy's packed with Nilfgaardian parvenus…
   1144605|00000000||Witcher!
   1164812|00000000||I have oft heard Geralt boast that in terms of monsters, he firmly believes he has seen it all. Yet what he encountered on this occasion demanded that he revise that view. While travelling through Toussaint, he happened on a female hermit who claimed she an invisible specter was tormenting her and would be her end. The witcher was skeptical, not least because he could not imagine how he might defeat something invisible.<br>The woman's suffering seemed so intense, however, that he resolved to try to help her.<br>
   1164813|00000000||To be able to track the hermit-haunting wraith, Geralt imbibed a dose of a brew the woman prepared. The concoction had a highly surprising side effect - for Geralt began to understand the speech of his trusty steed, Roach.<br>Together, the witcher and his mount tracked down the nightmarish ghost. It proved to be the spirit of a knight, Pinastri's former lover, who had committed a terrible crime when in anger he had attacked his own horse and beat it to death. He remained restless in the afterlife for the hermit had refused to forgive him for the deed.<br>Yet the story ended happily thanks to Roach - namely, the mare decided to forgive the ghost on behalf of the horse he had murdered.<br>

He remained restless in the afterlife for the hermit had refused to forgive him for the deed.<br>The story did not end well, for Roach, too, refused to forgive the ghost on behalf of the dead horse. Geralt defeated the knight spirit, but he believed this was only temporary, that the specter would ultimately return to demand forgiveness from the hermit.<br>
   1164815|00000000||To be able to track the hermit-haunting wraith, Geralt imbibed a dose of a brew the woman prepared. The concoction had a highly surprising side effect - for Geralt began to understand the speech of his trusty steed, Roach.<br>Yet Geralt decided he shouldn't devote his attention to a specter that he could not see. After a time he returned to visit the hermit, only to learn that Roach herself had proved quite the witcher, having resolved the crisis on her own.<br>
   1164816|00000000||To be able to track the hermit-haunting wraith, Geralt imbibed a dose of a brew the woman prepared. The concoction had a highly surprising side effect - for Geralt began to understand the speech of his trusty steed, Roach.<br>Yet instead of pursuing the elusive specter, Geralt turned his attention to other matters.<br>
   1211203|00000000||Alas, Geralt's worst expectations came true, as he learned when some time later he tried to pay the hermit another visit. He found her dead, and the marks on her body suggested that Marcello had returned as an umbra and sucked all the blood from her body.<br>Geralt grew pensive, considering the nature of human stubbornness and ill-conceived pride. Yet if I know him at all, I would say he devoted little time to these thoughts. For the witcher is a man of action, not a philosopher, and as it did every day, the Path beckoned.<br>

   1123433|00000000||Defeat the spirit.

   1166762|00000000||Roaming through the Caroberta Woods, Geralt ran into a group of bandits… He tended to the overly aggressive rogues quickly, yet as he was striding away, he tripped over one of the cooling corpses and happened to spot a letter. When he read it, it proved interesting to say the least…<br>
   1166763|00000000||From the letter he learned of a gardener, erstwhile groundskeeper at the Nilfgaardian embassy, and his most unfortunate dealings with a band of robbers. The note suggested some interesting loot might still lie concealed in the embassy cooperage…<br>
   1207253|00000000||Geralt made quick work of finding the hidden chest. Pleased with himself, he set off in search of his next adventure!<br>
   1166764|00000000||Search the workshop and find the chest with the loot.
   1207254|00000000||Read the letter found on the bandit's body.
   1166761|00000000||The Inconstant Gardener
   1175190|00000000||Well? What is it?
   1175188|00000000||I simply haven't the time!
   1175192|00000000||I came out of Oxenfurt Academy with high honors, yet any broad-shouldered lump earns more around here…
   1175194|00000000||Living hand to mouth… Why, I stand to put nothing aside for my dotage!
   1124499|00000000||So she arrived in this little Nazairi cloak. And I tell you, love – tasteless is an understatement.
   1124501|00000000||Nazairi…? I'd never wear anything from that barbaric land.
   1124503|00000000||You know her. She often goes deep in hock to put on a show. That little number likely cost more than we make in a month.
   1124505|00000000||I truly wonder who she got to lend her that much coin…
   1124532|00000000||I was at home the other day, just sitting, when suddenly – knock, knock! I opened the door and who was there if not Lebioda's witnesses…
   1124534|00000000||I've heard of them. What did they want?
   1124536|00000000||Oh, they left me a stack of manuscripts about the Prophet. I've not had time yet to look through them.
   1124508|00000000||So you see, she claims puffed sleeves will be in fashion next season…
   1124510|00000000||Excuse me, got something I gotta take care of at window one…
   1124512|00000000||Puffed? You cannot be serious.
   1124514|00000000||I, too, find it hard to believe, for--
   1124516|00000000||Excuse me!
   1124518|00000000||Can you not see what it says there?
   1201322|00000000||We're on our break…
   1124522|00000000||Celine, darling, sign this for me, will you?
   1124524|00000000||Oh, there you are. Listen, there's something I--
   1124526|00000000||We are on break!
   1124528|00000000||Ah, you try to be polite, it just never gets through…
   1050488|b73a0fae||Helper
   1183503|00000000||Just confess, why don't you.
   1183507|00000000||Giving you one chance - to tell us everything, yourself.
   1183539|00000000||I've nothing to tell.
   1197138|00000000||You will come to Tesham Mutna and explain all. If you do not, I will raze Beauclair to the ground. This I promise you. You've three days.
   1197140|00000000||I shall be waiting.
   1183640|00000000||Sorry, Dettlaff. She used you. Part of her plan.
   1183575|00000000||Never was any abduction. She faked it to be able to control you, manipulate you.
   1183547|00000000||You lie! He seeks to turn us against each other!
   1183549|00000000||Let… let him speak.
   1183553|00000000||Blackmailers? Pure fiction. She planned everything. You killed all those men at her behest.
   1183556|00000000||That… is impossible.
   1165841|00000000||Kidnapping was a farce.
   1165840|00000000||Syanna and Rhena - they're one and the same person.
   1165843|00000000||Rhena's not her real name. This is Syanna, and Syanna is sister to Anna Henrietta, the duchess of Toussaint.
   1165845|00000000||Wh… what? What nonsense is this?
   1183586|00000000||Syanna was banished as a child… But it seems she trekked back here recently. Moved in to Dun Tynne and ran a vandaguild out of here.
   1183588|00000000||Sent a man called The Cintrian to Beauclair. To steal some wine for her, wine reserved for the ducal family. Cintrian led us to her.
   1183590|00000000||Caught him later stealing a jewel Syanna'd gotten from her father as a child.
   1183592|00000000||Hhhmm…
   1183469|00000000||Witcher, what is this?
   1183471|00000000||Sorry, Dettlaff. You've been had.
   1183475|00000000||My friend, please… you must listen to what Geralt has to say.
   1183505|00000000||Stop playing dumb. I know… everything. Your plan, that this was part of it.
   1183537|00000000||…
   1183502|00000000||You lied to Dettlaff, used him.
   1183491|00000000||Now we need only find Anna Henrietta's sister. Where should we look? Do you know?
   1183493|00000000||Mhm… Ran into Roderick, Dun Tynne's lord. Told me where I'd find Syanna.
   1183495|00000000||Then speak, and let's grab her. Time is short.
   1183497|00000000||Said she was in a room in the tower… very one we're in right now. Which, incidentally, looks nothing like a prison cell.
   1183499|00000000||And just so happens there's a carafe full of wine here. Bet it's stolen Sangreal.
   1183501|00000000||What's your point?
   1198021|00000000||Didn't expect this.
   1198027|00000000||Seems you've got some last scraps of honor left.
   1198029|00000000||It's the least I can do…
   1186521|00000000||Oughta answer for being a dunce.
   1186524|00000000||He's no traitor, just naive. Let himself me made a fool of, paid dearly for it.
   1200070|00000000||Made a fool? Whom by?
   1193691|00000000||Your sister. She's the one convinced him to let the bandits into his home.
   1195190|00000000||You're mistaken, you must be. This cannot be true.
   1186561|00000000||Your Grace… I know this vampire and--
   1186778|00000000||What? You know him? Who is he?
   1201538|00000000||Dettlaff.
   1201540|00000000||The same who so recently sat at my table and told me of Nazair?
   1201542|00000000||Is there anything else you've neglected to mention? A dragon living beneath Mount Gorgon, perhaps? Is anyone else here a vampire?
   1201494|00000000||Where is he now?
   1201419|00000000||Waiting for Syanna. If she doesn't show up to meet him by an appointed time, he'll destroy Beauclair.
   1189477|00000000||He dares threaten us?!
   1201421|00000000||Your Grace, we have three days to bring him Syanna and--
   1201545|00000000||Not a word.
   1201423|00000000||You have three days to bring me his head. No more secrets, no more helping vampires. I want what I'm paying for. The head of the Beast.
   1198070|00000000||We've discovered Syanna blackmailed the vampire, ordered him to kill those men.
   1198072|00000000||What… what nonsense is this?!
   1198074|00000000||She is his missing lover. Staged her own abduction to force him to do her bidding.
   1198076|00000000||He was a tool. Whole scheme was Syanna's, she was behind it.
   1186556|00000000||Roderick got duped and used. Just like the vampire.
   1186589|00000000||A propos, were you able to establish who kidnapped his beloved?
   1186484|00000000||Roderick had no knowledge of the blackmail.
   1186466|00000000||Your Grace, we must proceed with caution. Guardsmen saw vampires here… They could still be about.
   1186468|00000000||Vampires or no vampires, my sister is here. Find her.
   1186481|00000000||Your Grace, that--
   1186483|00000000||Syanna… It's true - it's you! Sister, dear… what have you gotten yourself into?
   1186477|00000000||So concerned, I'm surprised! Is there an ounce of truth to it?
   1189404|00000000||You… you feel resentment, I understand. But I promise, promise we shall work through all the unfortunate matters of the past…
   1189442|00000000||…
   1198040|00000000||We will discuss them later… Captain, escort Syanna to the palace. I shall meet with her as soon as we return.
   1201356|00000000||As you wish, Your Grace!
   1198042|00000000||And you, witcher, you have my thanks. I cannot believe my sister was so near the whole time…
   1201500|00000000||Roderick of Dun Tynne shall answer for treason and blackmail.
   1198038|00000000||Well, it truly does seem the best option.
   1198023|00000000||Conscience gets to you now?
   1198025|00000000||Better… Ahh, better late than never, right?
   1198020|00000000||Conscience gets to you now?
   1200061|00000000||He just fly off?
   1200063|00000000||He did not wish to act rashly. He's gone to soothe his nerves.
   1165011|00000000||Think he'll do it - make good on his threat?
   1200057|00000000||I cannot say. He can be unpredictable when fury consumes him.
   1198015|00000000||I shall go to him.
   1198017|00000000||Come again? After what he just…?
   1198019|00000000||You don't know Dettlaff like I do. If I don't do as he says… he truly will destroy the city. He's more than capable of it.

   1212525|00000000||<i>You ask why I have these big hands, my friend? Well, I’ll tell you my secret: exercise.</i><br>- Big Bad Wolf<br><br>The Big Bad Wolf who lived in the Land of a Thousand Fables was, like the other denizens of that strange sphere, created by Artorius Vigo based on a figure from folk tales. Once he served as a playmate to the duke’s daughters, acting out scenes with a certain red-hooded girl and her grandmother, but as the fable land slowly degenerated, so did he.<br><br>Geralt and Syanna met the Big Bad Wolf while he was nursing a nasty hangover and was not eager to cooperate. Yet since our heroes needed a bean which the wolf had, they forced him to act out his tale.<br><br>That tale ended as it always had: the Big Bad Wolf attacked the Hunter (played by Geralt), biting and clawing him fiercely while his own wounds healed almost instantaneously. Inevitably, however, the Big Bad Wolf was killed and his stomach cut open.<br><br>This time, out came not a grandma and her granddaughter, but a magic bean.

   1172488|00000000||What's all this tomfoolery?!
   1195049|00000000||But to sentence the witcher, a hero, to time in prison…?

   1170320|00000000||If you ever find yourself facing a monster that breathes fire, strikes with a tail tipped with venomous spines, bites with sharp teeth and swipes with even sharper claws and tends to knock its prey to the ground with a sonic blast, then you are fighting a slyzard. With an arsenal like that, it comes as no surprise folk often mistake these draconids for dragons. Yet the experts (meaning witchers) know slyzards constitute an entirely separate species, much smaller than dragons and far less dangerous. With one exception: slyzard females in mating season, or, even worse, just after laying their eggs. When fighting such individuals, my suggestion is to get as far as possible from the danger as quickly as possible, preferably by running, at full tilt, without looking back.

   1195580|00000000||Whaddaya want?
   1181172|00000000||I cannot believe that of all Toussaint's bold knights not a one could best the Beast!
   1181170|00000000||So witcher, are you the one the duquessa summoned to help?
   1181176|00000000||To serve you and your kin I am prepared.
   1181174|00000000||Your humble servant.
   1175829|00000000||Helpful creatures, ravens.
   1175835|00000000||Pretty helpful creatures. Call on them often?
   1175837|00000000||I try not to overdo it. But they can be so useful. As they were now, when I merely needed to be sure I could arrive in time should things go sour.
   1174701|00000000||Regis.
   1192871|00000000||Ah, there you are! Might we set off for Tesham Mutna now?
   1152792|00000000||Beyond this wall lies…
   1180071|00000000||An ancient vampire dungeon. Seen a lot of things in my time. Nothing quite like this, though.
   1180073|00000000||My, I feel honored. A man with such a wealth of experience, yet I'm about to show him something new. Now to open it.
   1194585|00000000||You lead.
   1180055|00000000||Scurvers. Must be getting close to their feeding ground.
   1180057|00000000||Correct. I told you there'd be danger.
   1180051|00000000||Lead the way.
   1180052|00000000||Sure you want this?
   1180061|00000000||Sure you know what you're doing?
   1180063|00000000||I can only hope I do. Please, let's go? The longer we delay, the less control I shall have of my faculties. I'd really prefer not to hurt you.
   1174691|00000000||We have arrived. The sacrificial chamber of torture and torment lies underground.
   1175861|00000000||In a moment. Just one last thing…
   1175863|00000000||What was that?
   1192898|00000000||Blood. The last favor the raven did me. I've also taken some sangurium, a solution that sharpens one's sense of smell. One drop of blood shall smell like a gallon to me, now.
   1175865|00000000||You crazy?! You're a recovering addict!
   1180043|00000000||Your outrage warms my heart, Geralt, but you must remain calm. I had no choice.
   1175867|00000000||As things stand, the die is cast. High time we set off for Tesham Mutna. My head's spinning already, and you're starting to smell quite tasty…
   1175869|00000000||And you're starting to scare me.
   1174681|00000000||See no reason to dawdle. Tesham Mutna - take me there.
   1174674|00000000||Let's go.
   1174685|00000000||Little expedition's starting to sound dangerous. Think I better prepare.
   1174687|00000000||I understand completely. Do tell me when you're ready to set off.
   1174675|00000000||Need to prepare.
   1193974|00000000||This place, Tesham Mutna - tell me more.
   1192874|00000000||Tesham Mutna - what's it like?
   1192881|00000000||It is a place of torment, a torture chamber. Long ago, shortly after we'd arrived in this world, one among us named Khagmar developed such a taste and lust for human blood that in one night he could imbibe an entire village.
   1192883|00000000||This brought trouble on the entire species. Common folk wearied quickly of living in constant fear. They began to hunt us, seek the aid of mages and witchers in tracking us down.
   1192885|00000000||So what? Not like they could ever hope to kill you.
   1192887|00000000||But they were bothersome. Forgive the comparison, but when did you last enjoy mosquito buzzing around your head? In any case, the other vampires decided something had to be done, Khagmar had to be caught and punished.
   1192889|00000000||A torture chamber was thus outfitted in the dungeons of Tesham Mutna. Inside it, a cage made entirely of a special alloy of silver, dalvinite and meteorite steel.
   1192891|00000000||Khagmar was captured and locked in the cage. Sat there over two centuries, driven to fury time after time, never able to escape. Thus I know the cage will withstand the fury to which we shall drive my humble being.
   1192863|00000000||All right, so what do you wanna do?
   1192865|00000000||We shall visit Tesham Mutna, an ancient vampire estate. There we will find cages suspended in the air. I will enter one, be confined. You will lure beasts there.
   1192867|00000000||Beasts you will then kill. The bloodletting should prove profuse. Abundant enough so that the blood's scent will drive me mad, wild.
   1175858|00000000||How do you plan to induce this state?
   1175859|00000000||Dangerous? Who for?
   1175879|00000000||Dangerous? Why? I mean, you'll still be you, right?
   1182083|00000000||True. But I shall be highly agitated, in a state of fury. You know better than I that fury cannot be controlled..
   1175881|00000000||If you've ever seen an enraged vampire, you know very well that all who find themselves nearby will be in grave danger.
   1175883|00000000||How will we handle that? I'd rather not have you lunge at me, claws extended.
   1175885|00000000||That makes two of us. But worry not. I've thought it through very thoroughly. Details to follow, soon.
   1175849|00000000||Shouldn't be a problem. I happen to know a higher vampire who should be willing to help. Right, Regis?
   1175851|00000000||It's not that simple, I'm afraid. While you were away I tried my damndest to identify a replacement, but alas, none such exists.
   1175853|00000000||Not sure I understand what the problem is. Can't we just draw some of your blood?
   1175855|00000000||The blood must be in an agitated state. As I'm certain you know, higher vampires can change their corporeal shell. As our flesh changes, so does our blood's chemical composition.
   1175857|00000000||To make a long story short, I shall need to induce in myself a state of strong psychokinetic arousal. In brief, madness, rabidity. And that stands to be very, very dangerous.
   1175824|00000000||Managed fine alone, but… thanks for the thought. Gonna need much longer to finish brewing Resonance? Mentioned a last ingredient, too - what about that?
   1174658|00000000||That, I fear, might prove troublesome. You see, to use the concoction to summon the memories of one, the solution must contain the blood of another specimen of the same species.
   1192827|00000000||Send your spies after me?
   1192829|00000000||My watchers. Were something to go wrong, I could then arrive quickly to help.
   1175828|00000000||Spying on me?
   1174652|00000000||Think your friend's hand'll make for a nice broth?
   1175814|00000000||Hm, you've clearly honed your sense of humor. But we are not cannibals, Geralt. I took a fragment of tissue from the hand. It will suffice to prepare some Resonance.
   1175816|00000000||What'd you do with the rest?
   1175818|00000000||I cremated it, as our codex commands. A raven told me you'd acquired the necessary ingredient.
   1178555|00000000||Victim's been disemboweled. Intestines ripped clear out.
   1178557|00000000||Scurvers've gnawed on this corpse. Repeatedly.
   1201095|00000000||What's this symbol mean?
   1201717|00000000||It's the symbol of the Tdet. Those who went east, beyond the Blue Mountains.
   1174716|00000000||This place - there's evil here. Death hangs in the air.
   1174718|00000000||Yes. A great many beings have breathed their last here.
   1201724|00000000||Who's is this glyph?
   1201726|00000000||Ammurun. They ventured beyond the sea.
   1201728|00000000||And this one? Which tribe's this?
   1201730|00000000||Gharasham. My tribe, and Dettlaff's. We both remained in this part of the world.
   1198754|00000000||Something wicked here. It's in the air, I can smell it…
   1201086|00000000||Glyphs're carved into the rock. Coated with blood, used to be. They mean something?
   1201088|00000000||They're emblems, symbols of hmm… what you would call tribes, dispersed throughout the world after the Conjunction. My ancestors placed them here to remind us all where we came from.
   1198815|00000000||"Human Husbandry and Care"? This for real?
   1198817|00000000||The author observed humans, their behavior, over the many years he spent breeding them. Morally suspect though it may be, it's a thorough survey of the topic.
   1199485|00000000||Cells? Who for?
   1199487|00000000||Ahh, disgraceful, excruciatingly so, this particular page from our history… I'd rather not summon the demons of the past, if it's all right with you.
   1206202|00000000||Seems your kind assembled a peculiar little library…
   1206204|00000000||Indeed… Though I personally did not lay a hand to it.
   1199482|00000000||I told you - Khagmar thrashed about inside it for over two centuries. Appearances can be deceiving.
   1199480|00000000||It's forged of an alloy of silver, dalvinite, and meteorite steel. It will hold.
   1199478|00000000||This'll hold? Doesn't look like anything special.
   1187710|00000000||How the hell…?
   1174708|00000000||It's an ancient form of protection against unwanted guests. The mechanism which releases the latch reacts only to a higher vampire's blood.
   1199034|00000000||Tricky mechanisms, a vampire hideout - fortified, secured. Must've been important to your species once, Toussaint.
   1198736|00000000||It shall always be so. During the Conjunction, the gate from our world into this one opened upon this land and no other. This was the first place we saw.
   1165410|00000000||To love - the one and only point to life!
   1165412|00000000||Such style, such class…
   1193622|00000000||What luck I was working out of town when those vampires…. Brrr…
   1165408|00000000||Hm. All gray down there, too?
   1165406|00000000||Looking for adventure?
   1189597|00000000||So, you feel at home yet, at Corvo Bianco?
   1189595|00000000||That's what they call witcher reliability… Thank you, Geralt of Rivia!
   1189591|00000000||Life in Beauclair can be quite dear. Death, though - that's always free!
   1189593|00000000||They summoned a witcher… Well, why not - who's to tell the rich how to spend their coin?
   1189599|00000000||Someone! Anyone!
   1189605|00000000||Eat, drink, love and dance the day away!
   1189601|00000000||Hullo!
   1189603|00000000||I'll call my beau!
   1125952|86b99be4||Llinos of Metinna
   1163299|00000000||For the duchess and her dainty teets!
   1163303|00000000||Your heart turn stiff and your willy wobble!
   1163301|00000000||You'll find me a harder nut to crack.
   1163297|00000000||Hey! You! Hellcat!
   1163307|00000000||You're damned impressive, Jeralt!
   1163305|00000000||Jeeeer-alt of Rivia, no joke…
   1194790|00000000||Jeralt of Rivia! The Beast Slayer!
   1163311|00000000||Our duquessa - do you poke her too, Jeralt?
   1163309|00000000||The famed Jeralt of Rivia! Lover of witches and succubi!
   1194408|8a2e9f0a||Knight Errant
   1195815|00000000||Beg your pardon!
   1195817|00000000||Master… what're you planning with that sword?
   1195819|00000000||Don't hurt me…
   1195820|00000000||Pick and choose while I've the inclination…
   1195813|00000000||Once I close this shambles down, you won't see me till next week!
   1195832|00000000||Come on, good folk. come quickly! I haven't enough for everyone!
   1195830|00000000||Hullo, fellow, well met!
   1055668|61e6661e||Endrega Warrior
   1162080|00000000||Spilled paint. Reeks to high heavens of turpentine.
   1195999|00000000||Got paint drops here, too.
   1195997|00000000||Another stain. Could very well be a lead.
   1196009|00000000||Footprints. Clear, but curiously small.
   1196001|00000000||Footprints. Smudged.
   1153980|00000000||Stop your ogling, this is no cabaret. Will you play or not?
   1177213|00000000||What's the stake?
   1177215|00000000||Look at this, not two fleas to his name and he asks about stakes. You can bet those rags you're wearing.
   1177217|00000000||What'll I get if I win?
   1177219|00000000||Bread. I put some aside for Stefan, but it won't kill him to go hungry.
   1177221|00000000||Who's Stefan?
   1177223|00000000||None of your rotten business. A rat. So, playing?
   1159148|00000000||Why not.
   1159150|00000000||Lay them out, then.
   1148262|00000000||Sure. Let's play.
   1148263|00000000||Another time.
   1148424|00000000||Another time, maybe.
   1148426|00000000||So, off-poff-poff with you.
   1148563|00000000||You sure bumbotched that. You're too dumb to win at jailhouse gwent.
   1148565|00000000||Entitled to your opinion.
   1159146|00000000||That's no opinion, that's a fact. Now hand over the rag. I'm done playing you. Waste of my diddling time.
   1148559|00000000||You fleeced me, harlotsbrood. Now Stefan will have to go hungry.
   1177209|00000000||Sorry.
   1177211|00000000||Oh, look at that, he's sorry.
   1177702|00000000||No one else will play with you in this coop. And be careful not to slip on any soap.
   1148561|00000000||Oh, I will.
   1187468|00000000||Sorry, I've this runny nose…
   1187466|00000000||Hrrrmph! Mhm, bumbotch it all…
   1200494|00000000||They fought like two cats in a bag. And now they're to run Belgaard together!
   1187470|00000000||Akh akh… I've work up to my chin and I've caught some rot.
   1187472|00000000||Akh akh… You've spread some nastiness to me!
    592019|00000000||That hurt? As it should've!
    592011|00000000||Don't let up!
    592013|00000000||With vigor, lads! Vigor!
    592007|00000000||Hoo-ahh!
   1092823|00000000||I feel a wonderful song coming on. And the subject matter - unique!
   1106066|00000000||And all for the glory of Her Grace, the Duchess! Let's go inside!
    562406|1d6dfec5||Hunter
   1173788|00000000||Remember what Joss said about the red bean. A human has it… and he definitely didn't swallow it.
   1153848|00000000||Mhm. Gotta open his belly.
   1153851|00000000||Bottle caps… fake teeth… a corkscrew… Ah, here it is. Red bean.
   1153853|00000000||Ah, at last we have them all.
   1153855|00000000||Well then - one step closer to our goal.
   1159240|00000000||What?
   1159242|00000000||I find myself wondering if you're just horribly discreet, or if those mutations completely scrubbed away your curiosity.
   1175283|00000000||In your shoes, I'd have myriad questions. For instance, "Syanna, whatever became of you after they drove you out?" But you? Nothing. You avoid all talk of it.
   1175281|00000000||Are you really not interested in what happened? In what became of me after they cast me out?
   1175330|00000000||Maybe you should've stayed there…
   1175400|00000000||Should've stayed there, maybe.
   1175402|00000000||Perhaps. Perhaps I should have forgotten everything, started a new life.
   1175406|00000000||But you know what? There came a point when I thought, "You wanted a monster? Then a monster you shall get."
   1175329|00000000||Been through a lot.
   1175385|00000000||Been through a lot.
   1175387|00000000||I have. And throughout this time my sister was stomping grapes and shagging minstrels on down bedding.
   1175389|00000000||She wasn't the one to banish you.
   1175391|00000000||And I'm not angry at her for that. I'm angry at her because she forgot. About me.
   1175393|00000000||Right, we've had our chat. Come.
   1159246|00000000||Ah, you're just less interesting than you think.
   1175300|00000000||Don't know the details of your story, no, but they don't matter. I've met a lot like you.
   1159263|00000000||Like me?
   1159265|00000000||You were wronged, betrayed. So you think you have a moral right to exact bloody vengeance. And you've set out to settle the score… even if it costs you your life.
   1159267|00000000||Well, well. You've seen right through me.
   1159269|00000000||Not entirely. Still don't know if you realize how badly you fucked up. Doing what you did to Dettlaff.
   1173843|00000000||On second thought, I liked you more when you were silent. Let's get out of here.
   1173837|00000000||You're just less interesting than you think.
   1173835|00000000||All right - tell me what happened.
   1175332|00000000||Well, since you brought it up… I'd gladly hear the rest. Let's see, they'd escorted you out of the duchy…
   1175334|00000000||Yes, and the noble knights of Toussaint and I didn't stop until we reached the Caed Dhu wilderness. They left me there alone, without a copper, in a torn lace dress. Right when the frosts were setting in.
   1175336|00000000||Well, since you brought it up… I'd gladly hear about it.
   1175338|00000000||The flower of Toussaint's knights took me all the way to the Caed Dhu wilderness and left me there alone, without a copper, in a torn lace dress. Right when the frosts were setting in.
   1173852|00000000||They assumed something would eat me. Or that I'd do everyone a favor and die of hunger.
   1173870|00000000||But as always, I failed to live up to expectations. I wandered the woods for a week, went purple from the cold, gnawed the bark from twigs. Finally I saw a light among the trees… a campsite.
   1173872|00000000||They were bandits. Bearded, drunk, spattered with blood. I was sure they'd rape me or kill me… or both.
   1173874|00000000||Take it neither happened?
   1173876|00000000||That's when I learned a robber and murderer can be a better man than a knight in shining armor.
   1173878|00000000||They took me in, we set off for Nazair… and I did what I could to repay them. I advanced in their ranks rather quickly. Eventually I became their leader. Of the whole ragged band.
   1152176|00000000||What?
   1152178|00000000||A thousand times they cut my gut open, filled it full of rocks and drowned me in the river! So once you stopped coming, I decided to repay the little imp for all her loving labor.
   1175437|00000000||Hood now rots at the bottom of the well. She and the Hunter. Which means we can't play, and I'm under no obligation to talk to you. Not about beans nor anything else. So leave me be! Sod off!
   1176741|00000000||That's one prickly wolf…
   1176743|00000000||Hm. Wolf's pretty cranky…
   1176747|00000000||Surprised? Think about it. He was cast in the role of the nemesis without ever asking for it.
   1176749|00000000||It's a dog's life, I tell you…
   1176740|00000000||What now?
   1176751|00000000||So… what now?
   1176753|00000000||Don't worry. I'll play with him, or rather play him… I just need that little red hood. The piece of apparel, that is. Not the poor girl's corpse.
   1176755|00000000||That's a relief.
   1176757|00000000||You wished to help me? Here's your chance. Jump in the well and fish it out. Well? Chop, chop!
   1153844|00000000||You again? I thought I was clear. I will not talk to you if Little Red Riding Hood is not with you!
   1153450|00000000||Hello? Can we ta--?
   1153452|00000000||Shhhush. Bumbotch, my head… Damn it all, I swear, that was the last time I drank with Redbeard…
   1153778|00000000||Oh, Syanna. A bloody long time it's been. You've changed.
   1153780|00000000||Whereas you, not at all, Big Bad Wolf. Though it seems you've started running with the wrong crowd…
   1153782|00000000||And who should I run with, eh? Thumbelina? One shot, and she's under the table. But, but, but… what brings you?
   1153784|00000000||Have a drink with us.
   1153790|00000000||You could always have a drink with us.
   1153792|00000000||What? Now? Not on your life. I can barely stand I'm so hungover…
   1153794|00000000||You know what they say about the "hair of the dog."
   1153802|00000000||Out of the question… And why must you drink? Do you wish to drown some sorrow? And I don't mean to pry, but… you don't look much like a young duchess to me.
   1153804|00000000||They stripped me of my title and birthright, then banished me. A family spat, let's say.
   1153783|00000000||Looking for the magic beans.
   1153786|00000000||Listen, looking for magic beans. Seen any?
   1153788|00000000||Hmm… I was given one for safekeeping, but…
   1153806|00000000||Where is it? Talk!
   1153808|00000000||Shhhh, not so loud!
   1153820|00000000||I can be much louder than this. And resort to other means of persuasion.
   1153822|00000000||Ah, right there, the threats! Syanna to a T! Listen, I exist to restage a fairytale. If you want to play at it, I'll be happy to oblige… but it won't be easy. The thing is, Little Red Riding Hood's popped her clogs.
   1159290|00000000||Not a problem. Syanna can take her place.
   1175398|00000000||What? Hmph. Very well, it's not as if I can forbid you… Ahem. Granddaughter, come closer, sweetie!
   1152198|00000000||But grandmamma, what big eyes you have!
   1152200|00000000||The better to see you with, my dear.
   1152202|00000000||Granny, what big arms you have!
   1152204|00000000||The better to embrace you with, my dear.
   1153838|00000000||And grandmamma, what big teeth you have! Eh?
   1153841|00000000||The better to eat you with, my dear! GRRRAAAARR!
   1159291|00000000||Syanna can play Hood.
   1159292|00000000||We'll come back later.
   1159300|00000000||We'll be back. C'mon, Syanna.
   1175277|00000000||Any luck?
   1175279|00000000||Yep. Look what I got.
   1164345|00000000||Don't know much about fashion.
   1164350|00000000||Sorry, don't know much about fashion.
   1164353|00000000||Yes, it shows.
   1164346|00000000||So-so.
   1164355|00000000||Honestly? So-so.
   1164357|00000000||Women must love you.
   1164359|00000000||Actually, I do just fine.
   1162458|00000000||Let's go see the Big Bad Wolf.
   1176764|00000000||Lemme guess… you'll play the granddaughter.
   1176766|00000000||Mhm. And you - the hunter.
   1164348|00000000||Not bad. Not bad at all.
   1164344|00000000||Not bad, not bad at all.
   1155764|00000000||That would never fit you. Give it to me.
   1162454|00000000||How do I look?
   1175273|00000000||Any trouble? That took a while.
   1175275|00000000||Trouble the only option? Ran into a rather helpful little blue flame. Wanted to show me something.
   1176783|00000000||I need peace and quiet. Leave me alone…
   1162471|00000000||All right… time to jump in the well.
   1162473|00000000||Break a leg.
    585712|d594cde5||Waitress
   1188705|00000000||How is it the duquessa does not fear him as well…?
   1188703|00000000||Those scars, that gaze… Brr, I shiver just looking at him.
   1188707|00000000||Do you seek someone?
   1188709|00000000||I beg your pardon.
   1154046|00000000||Normally I'd encourage you to try our famed Fisherman's Chowder, but alas… we are all out of crayfish.
   1173908|00000000||Could replace them with something else. Perch, for example…
   1175261|00000000||Replace crayfish with fish! I beg you! What next? Vinegar for wine? Parsley for thyme? Ehh, you Nordlings are a pleasant lot, but about cuisine you know nothing.
   1154053|00000000||Show me what you got in stock?
   1154049|00000000||Show me what you got.
   1188478|00000000||Not likely to taste your famous Fisherman's Chowder, so maybe we could play some gwent?
   1181903|00000000||Up for some gwent?
   1154059|00000000||Thanks. So long.
   1154051|00000000||Farewell.
   1154050|00000000||Heard any rumors?
   1154055|00000000||Got any gossip? Fishermen talking about anything interesting?
   1154057|00000000||Yes. About a Nordling who would replace crayfish with pike.
   1173910|00000000||Asked a serious question.
   1173912|00000000||Mhm. And a tactless one. I do not eavesdrop on my clients, and I certainly don't repeat anything I chance to hear!
   1154048|00000000||Greetings! What do you need?
   1199497|00000000||Rhena!
   1199500|00000000||Are you… are you hurt? If any of them…
   1201279|00000000||You know me. I'd never let them hurt me. I just waited for you to come.
   1201281|00000000||I… I didn’t know where to look. They threatened to kill you… I…
   1201283|00000000||Forgive me. I failed you.
   1150210|00000000||Syanna - what exactly are you suggesting we do about her?
   1150221|00000000||Really wanna free Syanna, hand her over to Dettlaff? Refuse to accept you consider that wise.
   1150225|00000000||It's hard to believe, I know, but… Dettlaff is not actually evil, merely impulsive. He needs but meet with her, speak with her… and he will spare the city.
   1158927|00000000||Mgh. So say I agree to this, 'cause I might… still no chance Anna Henrietta will.
   1150953|00000000||I do not recall ever suggesting we ask her permission.
   1176021|00000000||Any idea where Syanna's being held?
   1176042|00000000||Got serious reservations about this plan… Not least among them - we have no idea where Syanna's being held. You heard the duchess - she's not at the prison.
   1176044|00000000||Hardly a reservation. More of an excuse. I'm certain you'll find her, you must merely decide you wish to.
   1176046|00000000||Hm. Could ask Damien. Duchess treats him like a lap dog, keeps him close most times. He might know something more.
   1176048|00000000||There, you see? I knew you'd think of something. Bravo.
   1176020|00000000||Syanna can't be harmed. Can you guarantee her safety?
   1176034|00000000||The meeting - what if it's nothing like you say? What if it goes sour… ends in a fight? Willing to guarantee Syanna won't get hurt?
   1176036|00000000||It seems unlikely in the extreme that--
   1176038|00000000||Didn't ask for a lecture on probability. Need a simple answer - yes or no.
   1176040|00000000||I vow that not a hair on her head shall come to any harm.
   1176072|00000000||I trust I've dispelled your doubts, then?
   1176074|00000000||Not so fast. We're not done talking.
   1150662|00000000||Syanna failed to appear as summoned. And… there. Dettlaff was not making idle threats.
   1150664|00000000||Seems not… Need to make some serious plans of our own, now. It's gone too far, dammit.
   1193898|00000000||Regis… you mentioned there was a way to draw Dettlaff out, a way you've avoided resorting to so far because you thought it too dangerous.
   1193900|00000000||Is that how I put it? Do forgive me, then, I've misled you terribly. The word "dangerous" is simply a scandalous understatement in this case.
   1193904|00000000||Regis, another inner monologue growing out of a personal dilemma. Just tell me how to flush Dettlaff out, force him to meet. Please.
   1161979|00000000||Gotta find him, stop him. Question is how. We've tried everything.
   1175888|00000000||That… is not exactly true.
   1176112|00000000||There is a certain staggeringly dangerous, mind you, way to force Dettlaff to reveal himself… and incite him to fight.
   1150668|00000000||That so? Go on, then, lemme hear it.
   1150713|00000000||In due course. But first, Geralt… I'd like you to consider the alternative. After all, you could fulfill Dettlaff's demand and liberate his beloved Syanna.
   1164298|00000000||Think Dettlaff still believes Syanna's innocent?
   1164300|00000000||Think Dettlaff still believes Syanna's innocent?
   1164311|00000000||I believe he suspects something. He must. And he seeks to understand what happened.
   1164313|00000000||And for that, he's declared war on the entire duchy?
   1164315|00000000||What can I say… Moderation was never his strong suit.
   1150261|00000000||Crazy as the plan seems… I'll do it. I'll ask Damien about Syanna.
   1150263|00000000||You won't make me beg. I knew you wouldn't.
   1151133|00000000||Slow down. Not promising a thing… Just want to get a feel for the situation to start with. Coming with?
   1176078|00000000||Of course. Many hands make light work.
   1150255|00000000||Considering freeing Syanna. Let's talk to Damien.
   1150257|00000000||Sorry, Regis, but… folk've died. Got no time to lose, especially not on some kind of peculiar therapy for bizarre couples.
   1150259|00000000||I see… Alas.
   1151125|00000000||You know what to do. You must see Orianna, ask her to introduce you to the Unseen Elder. She might agree.
   1151127|00000000||What'll you do?
   1151129|00000000||Now? Whatever I can to limit the number of human victims to a minimum.
   1176089|00000000||Should you learn where the Elder dwells, do whisper a word to the ravens. I'll come and help.
   1176091|00000000||Even though that could mean you'll fight Dettlaff?
   1176114|00000000||Even though. Good luck, Geralt.
   1150254|00000000||Leaning towards no nonsense. Orianna, let's find her.
   1179778|00000000||No idea. Need to think.
   1179780|00000000||Not an easy choice. Understood.
   1179782|00000000||Permit me to leave you to wrestle with this dilemma. I'm needed in the city. I cannot stop what is happening, but I can try to limit the number of victims.
   1181385|00000000||Once you've decided… and learned something, perhaps, whisper a word to the ravens. I shall find you.
   1179776|00000000||Don't know. Need to think about it.
   1150245|00000000||Hm. So I'm basically stuck - either gotta give in to a blackmailer or fight him.
   1151106|00000000||You know what I would opt for. Should we free Syanna and arrange for her to meet with Dettlaff, there's a good chance we'll all survive this ordeal, Dettlaff included.
   1175995|00000000||Regis… don't mean to put you on the spot, but I gotta know - say I do decide to fight Dettlaff, who'll you stand with?
   1175999|00000000||Should you decide your sword is the sole solution, I shall not stand in your way.
   1176001|00000000||Appreciate it.
   1176003|00000000||Certainly hope so. Now please tell me… what is it you intend to do?
   1150215|00000000||What's next?
   1150211|00000000||Say I don't wanna negotiate, how could I get Dettlaff to reveal himself?
   1150233|00000000||How would I got about luring Dettlaff out of hiding - if I wanted to? With the blood of a virgin?
   1150237|00000000||You see, somewhere nearby lives an unusual denizen, one of the Unseen - ancient and powerful vampires, among the oldest and strongest.
   1166312|00000000||Mhm. And?
   1150243|00000000||Toussaint is this Unseen Elder's territory. All vampires owe him fealty while they're here. He need but say the word, designate a time and place, and Dettlaff will be forced to appear.
   1151082|00000000||So this Unseen Elder - how do we convince him to summon Dettlaff?
   1151084|00000000||We must find him, first.
   1151086|00000000||The Elder does not see arrivals unless he absolutely must. But locals, Orianna, for instance… You know, she too is--
   1151089|00000000||Yeah, figured it out. All right, let's say she gets me in to see the Unseen Elder… what then?
   1151098|00000000||I don't know. You'll have to improvise, I suppose.
   1209929|00000000||Syanna failed to appear as summoned. And… there. Dettlaff was not making idle threats.
   1209931|00000000||Seems not… Need to make some serious plans of our own, now. It's gone too far, dammit.
   1191757|00000000||Gray tufts, grubby demeanor, yet saves your life in a pinch. That's a witcher for you.
   1191450|00000000||Grandma! Grandma!
   1175662|00000000||Help! Save me!
   1175666|00000000||Any herbs you might need, witcher?
   1175664|00000000||Greetings.
   1198264|00000000||The duquessa is dead. Hard times in store…
   1175670|00000000||Fond of shortcuts? Be careful you do not trample any herbs!
   1175668|00000000||Beggartick came up wilted something awful this year…
   1175672|00000000||Where are you walking?!
   1152539|00000000||Show me what you're peddling.
   1152533|00000000||Show me your wares.
   1152541|00000000||So long.
   1152535|00000000||See you.
   1152534|00000000||Who'd you buy the storehouse from?
   1152537|00000000||Was wondering… previous owners - what'd they use the warehouse for? Why was it full of carrion?
   1177191|00000000||It was Godfried Nork's before it was mine. Yes, that Nork - Toussaint's most famed charcutier.
   1177193|00000000||That is, until his saucisse a la moutarde poisoned half the court of Her Illustrious Highness the Duquessa.
   1177195|00000000||Take it he fell out of favor?
   1177197|00000000||Favor's not the word. He was cast in prison, all his property confiscated and auctioned off.
   1173661|00000000||Oh, the stench - absolutely rancid! Witcher! Help!
   1173660|00000000||Pardon me. Perhaps… perhaps you could help me? You seem a strapping lad.
   1177007|00000000||What's the problem?
   1177009|00000000||I acquired this old storehouse at auction. As it turns out, it stinks like an Ofieri larder and is loud as a Novigrad brothel!
   1177011|00000000||Bumbotch it all, I invested my life's savings! Now I fear to go inside! Do help me, witcher.
   1173663|00000000||All right. I'll take a look inside your storehouse.
   1173633|00000000||Sure. I'll look into it.
   1173671|00000000||Well? Have you seen to my storehouse?
   1173677|00000000||Relax, I'll get to it.
   1173665|00000000||Sorry. No time just now.
   1173634|00000000||Don't have the time.
   1210206|00000000||Let's talk about my fee.
   1210208|00000000||Could look into it, maybe… Long as you have the means to pay me.
   1210210|00000000||No. I fear not. That is not an expense I can accommodate.
   1210212|00000000||Have mercy, man, the store itself has already cost me a fortune. Drop your fee a bit more, please?
   1210214|00000000||Fine, so be it. We've a deal.
   1210216|00000000||Sorry, simply not affordable to me.
   1173667|00000000||Storehouse was full of rotten meat. Attracted ghouls I had to get rid of.
   1177014|00000000||Saint Lebioda's calloused heels! But is it safe now? Completely?
   1177016|00000000||Mhm. Though I'd advise you to clean the meat out quick. Before other ghouls show up.
   1177018|00000000||Of course! Yes! I shall put my men to it toot sweet.
   1177020|00000000||Meanwhile, perhaps you need something? I've a meager stock just now, but come back in two days to see a full array. At a discount that will make you cross-eyed.
   1152532|00000000||The witcher! My savior!
   1173612|00000000||Lebioda wept, it is positively reesty.
   1194048|00000000||And? And? Is the storehouse safe?

   1190328|00000000||Tah rah ree rah!
   1190326|00000000||Whooo-ee!
   1207733|00000000||For the duchess!
   1190330|00000000||For the duchess!
   1190334|00000000||Hey!
   1190332|00000000||What's this then?!
   1198423|00000000||Congratulations on your victory in the tourney, witcher!
   1198425|00000000||Sir Ravix, is it not? Congratulations on your victory in the tourney!
   1190336|00000000||Pastime with good company, I love and shall until I die. Grudge who lust, but none deny - so gods be pleased, thus live will I!
   1190338|00000000||For idleness is chief mistress of vices all - then who can say but mirth and play is best of all?
   1190344|00000000||Lovely! Lovely!
   1190342|00000000||Come here, scamp!
   1190346|00000000||Behold the punishment for your foul deeds!
   1207727|00000000||Lovely! Lovely!
   1207729|00000000||Behold the punishment for your foul deeds!
   1207723|00000000||You shall be harrowed by the sword - my sword!
   1207725|00000000||Come here, scamp!
   1190340|00000000||You shall be harrowed by the sword - my sword!
   1207731|00000000||For Toussaint!
   1190348|00000000||For Toussaint!

   1206732|00000000||Greetings, my Lady. Have you decided?
   1206734|00000000||I have. I stand by all I said. I wish to endanger no one and thus choose the method involving an egg. If it's to be the egg of an oriole, I know where to find one. There is a nest in my clearing.
   1206736|00000000||Might you explain the nature of the ritual, its exact course?
   1206884|00000000||Guillaume means well.
   1206886|00000000||Guillaume's no foe. Though there's little honor in meddling, he meant well, means well.
   1206894|00000000||You guessed correctly - he was the one to hire me. But only because he wanted to help you.
   1148557|00000000||Are you ready, witcher?
   1188018|00000000||Need to find an egg, preferably an oriole's. Ritual itself isn't complicated, but like I said before, there'll be a side effect. Still sure you want to go through with it?
   1188059|00000000||Yes. I saw a nest in the clearing where we spoke. But before we go, tell me… what will become of the chick?
   1188061|00000000||We'll have to break the egg.
   1188092|00000000||Like you said, not everyone gets a happy ending.
   1188104|00000000||And for a dream to come true there must be sacrifices. Very well. Let us go.
   1200354|00000000||Need to find an oriole egg.
   1200672|00000000||Not ready yet.
   1200676|00000000||Need to take care of something first.
   1200678|00000000||I understand.
   1200682|00000000||Come back quickly.
   1128997|00000000||Not ready to do that yet.
   1128999|00000000||I understand lifting a curse is no simple affair, even for a witcher. But I've made my decision and fear none of the risks. Return to me when you are ready.
   1200355|00000000||Not ready yet.
   1200351|00000000||Absolutely sure you did the right thing? Not too hasty, rejecting his help?
   1200033|00000000||Can't conduct the ritual using your reflection without him. Needed someone who'd willingly assume the curse in your stead.
   1200043|00000000||And you thought I would agree to this? No, Geralt. When we spoke in the meadow, you told me of a ritual which required no lusty knights to aid us.
   1200341|00000000||This is the method I wish to pursue.
   1200013|00000000||Sure you did the right thing?
   1200012|00000000||Didn't tell him a thing. Must've figured it out himself.
   1200035|00000000||I kept your secret. Didn't tell him anything he didn't already know.
   1200353|00000000||I understand he hired you, so you had to report to him. But this is not his affair, Geralt. This is my life.
   1199976|00000000||My Lady, I live to serve you. Whatsoever you require, you need but beckon. I am yours to command!
   1201928|00000000||Are you quite finished? Is that all you wish to say?
   1201930|00000000||I… I-I suppose so.
   1199978|00000000||So, you shall do what I command, sir?
   1199981|00000000||Very well, then. Listen carefully. Leave this tent. Turn towards the duchy's northern marches. And run. Run until the tourney grounds are no longer within sight.
   1199985|00000000||Return only once you've cooled off. Then leave me be forever more. Understood?
   1199983|00000000||My Lady… but… your troubles… I only wished … The witcher, see…
   1199987|00000000||Out! Now!
   1199998|00000000||You assured me I could trust you.
   1206890|00000000||No, no scheming involved. Guillaume hired me. But this matter relates to you, not him. Didn't invite him here, in any case.
   1206892|00000000||Actually, surprised he showed up.
   1206888|00000000||Haven't hatched a thing.
   1206852|00000000||Sure, but… seems your tent's grown ears.
   1206883|00000000||Show yourself, Guillaume. Can hear you breathing. And I know damn well it's you.
   1206857|00000000||Why are you here, sir?! This is a private audience. Geralt, what is the meaning of this? Is this some scheme you've hatched unbeknownst to me?
   1188156|00000000||Sure. Wanna tell you something, though. Think we should try the alternate method first.
   1188158|00000000||I was clear. It is out of the question!
   1128981|00000000||Let me finish. Second method's less than reliable. To put it simply, might work, might not.
   1199631|00000000||But it will! I shall save you, oh lovely Vivienne!
   1199963|00000000||Why are you here, sir?! This is a private conversation!
   1200334|00000000||No need to be sharp with him, my Lady. And If I'm to help you, gotta do one thing for me - hear what Guillaume has to say.
   1201932|00000000||Is that an ultimatum?
   1201934|00000000||Looks to be.
   1200291|00000000||No need to be sharp. Hear him out.
   1199974|00000000||Guillaume means well.
   1200332|00000000||He's not your foe. Got good intentions. You guessed right, he hired me, but only because he wanted to help you.
   1200434|00000000||Be not angry, my Lady. You no longer bear this burden alone - I know all.
   1200436|00000000||You told him?!
   1200526|00000000||I know a curse afflicts you. A curse which grows more severe by the day. I understand how you feel. My aunt, Countess de Launfal, once contracted a strange illness which ate away at her from the inside.
   1200528|00000000||She grew weaker by the day, the light fading from her eyes. I remember her saying the worst was not the pain, but losing mastery of her own body. She was so helpless…
   1200530|00000000||I fear you feel the same. The witcher knows a way to lift the curse from you and let it rest on me. I wish to do this, to take it from you, Vivienne.
   1200532|00000000||Why?
   1200534|00000000||Because I love you.
   1200569|00000000||I might have died in the arena. I sought to slay a shaelmaar, for you… but now I see the fool I was, now I see how I risked my life for no purpose. Yet with this, I can truly do something for you.
   1200759|00000000||I do not wish to inflict this horror on anyone. You saw how it looks.
   1200590|00000000||Witcher… I turn to you as one elder and, hopefully, one wiser as well. Do you think this a good idea?
   1200642|00000000||Honestly, don't know. Already told you both, I can't predict the ritual's side effects. Guillaume's right about one thing, though.
   1200644|00000000||He's risked his life in completely pointless ways. Till now.
   1200634|00000000||Don't know.
   1200633|00000000||Worth a try.
   1200648|00000000||Worth a try, as I see it. Original curse fell on an unborn child. Doubt it'll take hold as strongly when transferred to a full grown man.
   1200662|00000000||You've now heard the expert opinion. Let us do this together, Vivienne.
   1200664|00000000||Very well… I was prepared to die. Thus I am also prepared to attempt something mad. Now we must go to my pool in the woods, yes?
   1200671|00000000||Let's go.
   1200680|00000000||Everything's agreed, so no point wasting any more time. Let's go.
   1191574|00000000||Mhm?
   1191576|00000000||Hm hm hm hm… LLa la la la la la la…. Hm hm hm hm hm…
   1050632|002efcee||Deer
   1177850|05aed300||Daphne
   1189731|00000000||Our blood's worth less than wine.
   1189729|00000000||I wouldn't mind if that Beast devoured me. I'd get some peace, at last.
   1189735|00000000||Not bad…
   1189733|00000000||Witcher? Right?
    465467|05df8c2c||Golem
   1205336|0001b0a6||Peacock
   1198122|00000000||But we did not meet so I could prove how very original I am.
   1178605|00000000||This a set up? Trying to get me to confess something?
   1178669|00000000||So, think you've set a nice little trap for me? Sorry. Wanna get me to confess? Gonna have to try harder.
   1178675|00000000||I love a challenge! In that case, my ears are cocked - what must I do?
   1179304|00000000||Hm… how about you get the ball rolling, reveal one of your secrets? Vampires - intriguing creatures, must lead fascinating lives.
   1178606|00000000||Got a lot of secrets.
   1178677|00000000||Everyone's got some secret.
   1178679|00000000||I agree wholeheartedly. I also believe it wise at times to share one's secrets, unburden oneself to those one can trust.
   1178681|00000000||This your sophisticated way of asking me if I trust you?
   1178683|00000000||I prefer almost always to ask indirectly. It seems a test of intelligence - one you just passed.
   1179307|00000000||Hm. Maybe you should go first, reveal one of your secrets? After all, you vampires lead very interesting lives.
   1178589|00000000||Maybe there's something you want to ask me, something specific?
   1178719|00000000||All right, give you one question. What do you want to know?
   1178721|00000000||One question to ask one as fascinating as you, Geralt? Cruel parsimony, I'd say. But I shall do my best to make it count.
   1178723|00000000||If you were to die and be reborn as I was… in your new life, would you choose to be a witcher?
   1178705|00000000||See, Regis…
   1185073|00000000||Doubt I'd know how to be anything else.
   1178707|00000000||Ever tried?
   1178709|00000000||See you're determined to get an answer. To find out if I like being a witcher. Just refuse to ask directly, as always.
   1178711|00000000||I like being on the Path. Like picking up a lead, a trail… I like the tension right before a fight.
   1178713|00000000||And nothing gets my adrenaline flowing like battling a beast. Even gotten used to people treating me like a freak, an outcast.
   1178715|00000000||Yeah. Not something I think about much, but I like being a witcher.
   1178716|00000000||Yeah. I'd be a witcher.
   1178717|00000000||Prefer to be someone else.
   1178725|00000000||That's what interests you most? Whether I'd like to be a witcher again?
   1178727|00000000||Many things interest me, but we've not much time left. Please answer.
   1178729|00000000||Never chose to be a witcher, fate chose for me. Had it been my choice, I'd have picked a different profession.
   1178731|00000000||A profession where I wouldn't have to risk my life every minute of every day. Maybe even one that'd earn me some respect.
   1179383|00000000||Thank you for being honest. Honesty's an attribute of the truly brave - and thus a privilege of the very few.
   1178617|00000000||No drinks for me. Need a nap instead.
   1178744|00000000||Not really in the mood for your concoctions. Especially given how they make you say things you'd rather keep to yourself. Remember that aspect very well.
   1178746|00000000||Geralt of Rivia, do I detect a guilty conscience? Word is only those ashamed of the truth seek to conceal it.
   1178748|00000000||Not about to fall for that. Forget it. Need a nap, and that's how I'm gonna use this time.
   1179593|00000000||Not as far as I know.
   1179611|00000000||Far as I know, none. Now whatcha got for me?
   1155092|00000000||Let's do this - start making your decoction while I go get some saliva from that wight. Uses it in its brews.
   1155094|00000000||Do you imagine the wight will simply sell you some?
   1155096|00000000||Worst case scenario, I'll bring you its salivary glands. They oughta do as well.
   1155098|00000000||For a moment there I imagined you asking the wight to spit into a vial. Quite amusing as a thought. But the salivary glands will do fine, indeed.
   1156206|00000000||So, see you later.
   1179681|00000000||Yes, till later. I shall start by perusing some tomes.
   1179683|00000000||Tomes? Thought you were gonna make this decoction.
   1179685|00000000||We require one last ingredient. Alas, obtaining it could prove a trifle toilsome. Thus I hope to identify a suitable alternative.
   1179687|00000000||All right. Good luck.
   1179689|00000000||And to you, my friend.
   1179620|00000000||Time to visit the wight.
   1179635|00000000||Hm. Know anything else about this curse?
   1179647|00000000||I don't recall much in particular. Really don't attach much importance to such things. It was mentioned to me, as an anecdote, no more…
   1179649|00000000||Come on. Search your memory - something, anything, could be important.
   1179651|00000000||Hmm… I believe it had a relation to hunger… or no, perhaps greed, rapacity? Someone was punished for something…
   1179653|00000000||Textbook definition of a curse, pretty much.
   1179655|00000000||Sorry, Geralt, I try not to clutter my mind with the details of every far-fetched tale I happen to hear.
   1179657|00000000||Hmm…
   1179664|00000000||What are your thoughts?
   1179666|00000000||A specimen of a species thought long-extinct… and a curse - in one place. That a coincidence, or are they related?
   1179668|00000000||Ah, professional curiosity. Personally I've nothing against you delving into this dilemma, but please remember we need the wight's saliva. Nothing beyond that.
   1179618|00000000||What's this about a curse?
   1179619|00000000||Know anything else about this wight?
   1166219|00000000||Wights rarely appear in the woods, even less likely to find them in abandoned human homes. They inhabit remote wildernesses, old, abandoned cemeteries…
   1179623|00000000||What's your point?
   1179625|00000000||This might not be a spotted wight after all. Your little helper might've made a mistake.
   1166229|00000000||I sincerely doubt it. Ravens are devilishly intelligent creatures. And they've highly developed observational skills.
   1166231|00000000||What exactly did they observe?
   1166241|00000000||The area around the estate, it's covered in… spoons.
   1166243|00000000||Spoons?
   1166247|00000000||Spare me the skeptical smile, I'm but the bearer of this news. Perhaps this spotted wight is a hoarder? Or the spoons are somehow related to the curse?
   1178740|00000000||You were right. No kobolds or mamunes - for miles around--
   1179586|00000000||Knew it.
   1178742|00000000||Allow me to finish. You see, there's this spotted wight. It haunts an abandoned residence in the Caroberta Woods.
   1179588|00000000||Impossible. My brethren hunted down every last spotted wight before I was born.
   1179615|00000000||Then it seems you must revise your knowledge of spotted wights. For somehow this one managed to survive your brethren's onslaught.
   1179617|00000000||Hm. It seems I know this home it haunts - recall a tale about it… Locals believe the place cursed. Perhaps that's how the wight survived, entirely unmolested…
   1179609|00000000||Appreciate the compliment. Got something for me?
   1179592|00000000||Appreciate the compliment.
   1179591|00000000||Ever vigilant, even in his sleep. Quite vampire-like, in fact. Are you absolutely certain they don't administer a few of our genes during the Trial of the Grasses?
   1179385|00000000||Still no sign of your winged friend… Sure it understood what you wanted?
   1179387|00000000||Dead certain. Let's wait a bit longer. It'll return soon, don't doubt that for a moment.
   1178703|00000000||Got plenty of questions I'd like to ask, but let's postpone any longer conversations until things calm down.
   1179420|00000000||Unable to focus your thoughts at the moment? I understand. I, too, am anxious to know the news…
   1178588|00000000||Know what, let's talk later.
   1192567|00000000||Back then, yeah. But we parted again soon after.
   1192561|00000000||Back then, yeah. But we parted again soon after. And when the time was ripe, she came back. Defeated the Wild Hunt together.
   1192563|00000000||Oo, seems I certainly missed quite a bit while I was… absent!
   1192565|00000000||True enough. But it's a conversation we'll have another time. Need to know more about you, now.
   1178685|00000000||Curious what you did after you were… reborn.
   1178687|00000000||As I'm sure you can surmise, at first I was thoroughly absorbed with recovering. As it is, I've still not recovered completely. Yet I was so weak the first year that I could not stand nor move on my own.
   1178689|00000000||Dettlaff bore my weakness bravely, showed great patience. If not for him, I wouldn't be here, and I'd have regenerated far slower.
   1178699|00000000||Once I could at last stand unassisted, I set off for Brugge, for my one-time home of Dillingen. There I led the peaceful life of a rural healer and surgeon, enjoying my neighbors' respect and, in fact, constituting the exact opposite of the monstrous vampire the populace imagines.
   1178701|00000000||Brugge, you say? Rebirth make you sentimental?
   1192559|00000000||Perhaps a dash. But what of you? Where have you been? Ever find your Cirilla?
   1178590|00000000||Where you been? What've you been doing?
   1178768|00000000||Got a new life, a new body. That give you a new start, a blank slate?
   1178770|00000000||Starting all anew is a very broad concept. What exactly do you mean?
   1178772|00000000||Your blood addiction, say. Wondering if your body's the same, if it still remembers. Maybe if you drank now, you wouldn't get hooked.
   1179323|00000000||All addictions are a form of slavery. Readdiction's not a risk I'm willing to take just to test a hypothesis about corporeal regeneration and whether propensities carry over.
   1192747|00000000||Fair enough. Curiosity, that's all. Sorry.
   1192749|00000000||Not to worry, Geralt. Curiosity's a natural reaction under the circumstances. Apart from which, I've always valued that trait in you.
   1178592|00000000||How are you handling abstinence, not drinking blood?
   1178581|00000000||Always fascinated me the way vampires can regenerate. A hand growing back is one thing, but Dettlaff recreating you out of a wet smear? Something else entirely.
   1179327|00000000||A difficult and laborious process, but one that's possible - as my presence proves. But, but, but… I've heard you too had quite the adventure - they say you lost your memory.
   1192600|00000000||For a bit. but Triss helped me get it back. Actually pretty damn lucky I only had amnesia.
   1192602|00000000||Yes, you humans are rather buggered in those terms. To strip you of life is, well, just plain easy. I've always pitied you in that regard.
   1178585|00000000||We vampires are much harder nuts to crack. If a member of another race kills one of us, we can be reborn with a living higher vampire's help.
   1178587|00000000||However, if one of our own strikes the deadly blow, death is permanent. There can be no rebirth. One of the chief reasons why vampires long ago swore never to fight one another.
   1178593|00000000||What's regeneration like?
   1178591|00000000||What's it like being dead?
   1178752|00000000||Gotta ask you the big question, one everyone wonders about - what happens after death?
   1178754|00000000||You wish me to tell you if the human belief in the gods is well founded. That I do not know. We vampires differ exceedingly from you humans.
   1178756|00000000||Our matter, that of which we are composed, can exist without form. We require neither a heart nor a brain nor air to breathe.
   1178758|00000000||But were you dead?
   1178760|00000000||As humans understand death - yes.
   1178762|00000000||Feel anything? Understand anything?
   1178764|00000000||Hm. It's rather hard to explain. I felt something very unsettling. Something I cannot even name, for I did no reasoning.
   1178766|00000000||Only after rebirth did I begin to understand that what I had felt was cold and unimaginable fear. If not for Dettlaff, I might have drowned in an eternity of icy terror.
   1192925|00000000||Can't have been alive, then. Sheesh, experience like that must be vicious.
   1192927|00000000||Hmm… Indeed, it's… it's hard to compare to anything I know. Yet you are aware we don't see death as you do. The way you cling to life - we find it entirely peculiar. You are mortals, ergo it's a foregone conclusion - you will die. It's but a question of time.
   1192929|00000000||Thus I often find myself wondering why you try so very hard. To die at twenty years, forty, even a hundred - what's the difference? They're all but the blink of an eye.
   1192931|00000000||Depends on your point view. Man who's got a million crowns to spend can't possibly understand one who's only got twenty.
   1192933|00000000||Very true. One's outlook can indeed change much.
   1178597|00000000||Anything in particular interest you?
   1178599|00000000||Guess you missed my point, Regis. I was glad to hear it's not the hooch because I don't want to talk about what I don't want to talk about.
   1178601|00000000||Oh, I understood you far better than you think. Allow me to reveal a secret - my mandrake distillate possesses no particular tongue-loosening powers.
   1178603|00000000||Those who drink it and talk simply have burdens they wish to lift off their shoulders. The hooch is but a convenient excuse, a cover that justifies their sudden candidness to themselves.
   1179302|00000000||All right, you first. Any burdens you want to unload? Vampires lead highly interesting lives - bet you've got some good secrets.
   1178604|00000000||Seems you chose to misunderstand - I don't want to talk.
   1178608|00000000||Rarely say no to a snifter.
   1178610|00000000||Sadly, this is but a weak infusion rather than a proper distillate.
   1178612|00000000||Even better. I remember your mandrake hooch. Made people say things they'd have rather kept to themselves.
   1178615|00000000||Now, what could Geralt of Rivia prefer to keep to himself?
   1178616|00000000||Let's drink.
   1179280|00000000||What was that?
   1179282|00000000||A raven. Rather a common sight at this latitude. Very intelligent fowl. I asked him to look for the creatures you mentioned. Him and his brethren.
   1179284|00000000||Perhaps they'll find one in the area. And I would hazard that a flock of ravens will spy any said creature faster than a solitary witcher would - with all due respect to your skills, my friend.
   1179288|00000000||It will take them some time, nonetheless, so… perhaps you'd care for a snifter of mandrake?
   1178791|00000000||Covinarius spent half his life proving his theory. Wild guess - making a dose of Resonance won't be easy.
   1178793|00000000||You guess correctly. In addition to Dettlaff's tissue, we shall need a powerful occipital lobe stimulant - effectively a poison to make one susceptible to visions.
   1178795|00000000||Hm. Well, got a few ingredients to choose from. Unfortunately, all are pretty rare…
   1178797|00000000||There's mamune glands, but closest ones I know of are in Vizima. A spotted wight's saliva would also serve, but they were culled to extinction over a century ago. Could go with a kobold's eyes, but the creatures are sentient - rather not gouge one's eyes out…
   1178799|00000000||Hmm… Given that we lack the time to sleuth this out ourselves, permit me to summon some help.
   1155164|00000000||Brew the decoction.
   1182072|00000000||Ring's pretty intriguing. Made of no metal I've every seen. And the ornamentation…
   1182074|00000000||It comes from our home - where we lived before the Conjunction of Spheres. It's actually mine. I received it from a dear old friend.
   1182076|00000000||You might call him a… humanist. He saw us, vampires, as guests here, guests who owe their hosts, meaning you humans and the Elder Races, respect.
   1182078|00000000||Respect? Meaning not to treat us like cattle to be slaughtered for food…
   1182080|00000000||Precisely. And the reason why I, in turn, gave it to Dettlaff - to remind him of the ideals my old friend championed.
   1182065|00000000||The ring - what's its provenance?
   1155167|00000000||Can't you just summon Dettlaff? You're both higher vampires, there's gotta be a way…
   1155169|00000000||If I'm to be entirely candid, there is indeed one. But believe me, we will be better off never availing ourselves of it. It is a last resort. Absolutely.
   1155171|00000000||Last resort? The hell. Why?
   1155173|00000000||Agh. There is a being who can summon Dettlaff. Possesses the authority, even the power, to force him to appear in a given place.
   1166191|00000000||But the very act of contacting this being, well, it's akin to walking a slack line extended over a chasm filled with molten lava.
   1166193|00000000||An exercise as perilous to me as it would be to you - a risk I'm unwilling to take. I beg you, let's do it my way - it'll be both quicker and easier.
   1155165|00000000||Can't you just summon Dettlaff?
   1156144|00000000||What do you want to use the hand for?
   1156162|00000000||The hand, what do you plan to do with it?
   1156164|00000000||You've heard of Covinarius' theory of tissue memory retention?
   1166280|00000000||Hm. Rings a distant bell… Read about it in "Alchemia Oblittera." There's a copy at Kaer Morhen, tattered, nearly disintegrated.
   1166282|00000000||But if memory serves, Covinarius never managed to prove it worked.
   1166284|00000000||He did prove it. Just never managed to publish his findings. He and I corresponded, you see, after we became friends. Thus I know he completed his research and performed the first tests.
   1166211|00000000||It's complicated, so without delving into details, it is possible to use any piece of tissue to reconstruct what a whole body experienced.
   1156172|00000000||How's it work? We need any special equipment?
   1156200|00000000||We must brew a decoction which Covinarius gave a rather poetic name - Resonance. Once imbibed, it sends one into a trance similar to that induced by narcotics.
   1166213|00000000||This triggers visions of events linked to strong emotions experienced by the tissue's owner. Picture it as dreaming a fragment of someone's life.
   1156202|00000000||Any chance we might see what Dettlaff was doing just before he lost his hand…?
   1166216|00000000||Indeed. Though I also hope Resonance will reveal the location of Dettlaff's hideout.
   1155993|00000000||Hm. Vampires can evade detection by the senses, and no divination magic works on us. Even the most precise megascope would be useless…
   1155999|00000000||And this? Could this help?
   1166163|00000000||Where ever did you get that?
   1155152|00000000||Off one of the Beast's victims, found by a bend in the river. Body was chopped, in pieces. Three of those pieces were hands.
   1182064|00000000||Hand with the ring seemed the odd one out. A bruxa had taken an interest in it.
   1155155|00000000||It's Dettlaff's hand, without a doubt. It will do splendidly.
   1155122|00000000||True enough. Need to find your friend. I'm hoping you'll agree to help.
   1155128|00000000||I shall do whatever's in my power. Yet what you want or even need must matter little. What matters is what Dettlaff wants. If he does not wish to be found, you will not find him. Ever. End of story.
   1192514|00000000||Come on, gotta be some way…
   1198139|00000000||Could've left the door unlatched.
   1198137|00000000||What of my privacy? I value it rather deeply. Unmolested, especially by unwanted guests - that's my preferred state. Besides, I knew you'd find a way to get in.
   1155088|00000000||Agreed to meet a vampire at a cemetery. How much more cliché can you get?
   1155090|00000000||Hahaha. Nothing comes readily to mind.
   1198249|00000000||Kikimore eggs. Need to incinerate these to ash.
   1198102|00000000||Dammit, locked. No way I got the place wrong. This is it, gotta be.
   1198104|00000000||Gotta be another way in around here.
   1155204|00000000||Decoction coming along? Doing all right?
   1152690|00000000||Better than you. No sign of the wight's brew or its salivary glands, I see.
   1152660|00000000||Regis. Couldn't have picked some other place to meet…?
   1198251|00000000||That's some stench.
   1193790|00000000||I shall set up my gear, start brewing Resonance. No reason to delay.
   1193778|00000000||Decaying bones. Kikimores must've tunneled into the grave.
   1198245|00000000||Kikimores. Had vittles aplenty around here.
   1194136|00000000||Huh? Huh?
   1194139|00000000||Where ye rushin' to?

   1192771|00000000||Can't get used to the way you knights talk.
   1196721|00000000||Especially how you switch back and forth between flowery and, well, near normal.
   1192773|00000000||We are knights-errant in the service of Her Gracious Magnificence.
   1196723|00000000||When we appear in her name or speak on her behalf, we are bound by tradition.
   1199690|00000000||No one here. They must have removed the body already.
   1199692|00000000||Let's look around, make sure they didn't miss anything.
   1169667|00000000||Notice anything interesting?
   1175294|00000000||Alas, nothing.
   1192692|00000000||No one here. They must have removed the body already.
   1192694|00000000||Let's look around, see if we can't find something interesting.
   1190835|00000000||All's in order.

   1190837|00000000||I want him alive!
   1190839|00000000||Put down your weapon and back away.

   1153933|00000000||What is it?
   1098334|00000000||Got yer coin, sir… And a wee gift to thank ye for the trust ye showed. This blade's "The Reckoner." It's saved mah arse a fair number o' times.
   1153935|00000000||Thanks, Cianfanelli. We'll call it even.
   1098336|00000000||One last thing… I'd like to apologize. For the whole mingin' kerfuffle.
   1123993|00000000||Master witcher! Spare me a wee moment?
   1180677|00000000||Promised tae deliver, and I will. Not one tae haver, mah words are nae wind.
   1179072|00000000||Death comes for you this day!
   1179074|00000000||Let's dance, drink, kill!
   1179076|00000000||I am life! I am death!

   1179070|00000000||Your death - such beauty!
   1179078|00000000||Brothers! Let us kill! Let us murder!
   1179080|00000000||Yeeees! Oh, yeeeesss!

   1179084|00000000||Spells! Spells!
   1186591|00000000||Master witcher! Some unknown individual barged into the residence. I resisted as best I could, but to no avail!
   1186649|00000000||Who is it?
   1186651|00000000||Alas, they did not do me the basic courtesy of introducing themselves!
   1092812|00000000||All cleared up now, right? No gods, no plague, just a dragon. But it's gone, too! We're to pay Emil's widow compensation and that will be that. So, why do you still stand there and wait, men? Back to work. Chop! Chop!
   1092814|00000000||And I've a notion suspicious workings are still afoot. What became of the builders who were to put the statue together? They were due three days back, yet there's still no sign of them at Ardaiso.
   1170949|00000000||They were crushed, too, I'm certain of it. Or eaten. Or! Or locusts got them! Like in Zerrikania!
   1092816|00000000||What's this rubbish you spout now? The architect wrote they would arrive a week late with a large shipment of marble from Metinna. For the prophet's beard. So stop flapping your yaps and get to work.
   1092818|00000000||Allow me to walk you away, master.
   1202669|00000000||Truth be told, I lied. But I cannot have them panic again. The workers he mentioned, they've indeed vanished. Come see me later, I shall divulge to you the details.
   1123601|00000000||You think he'll manage?
   1123603|00000000||Rumor has it he slew a basilisk once.
   1123605|00000000||Right. With a mirror, no less.

   1213765|00000000||The second of the missing transports was especially important, for with it was to have arrived the builders' supply of wine. Since time immemorial, and the world over, no significant structure had ever been completed without the workers erecting it having received their fair share of alcohol. Thus, finding this group and transport was critical to completing the statue of the Prophet Lebioda.<br>
   1213767|00000000||The witcher finally found the second group. As it turned out, its members had decided to stop and get a good, solid taste of the wine they were carrying. Alas, their tasting had quickly descended into a bender. As a result, our hero had to wake the drivers from their justified naps. Though monstrously hung-over, they soon set off again for their destination. Luckily, they had not managed to empty all the wine barrels they were carrying.<br>
   1214144|00000000||The inhabitants of Toussaint are considered very polite and pleasant folk, but there are exceptions to every rule. Geralt came across just such an exception in the form of a group of drunken workers gathered around a fire. This lot had a strange idea of hospitality: they served him insults as an hors d'oeuvre, then moved on to fisticuffs for the main course.
   1214145|00000000||After the ruckus the workers decided they had no more reason to linger and set off to their destination, which was the building site of the Prophet Lebioda's statue.
   1214586|00000000||Once the drunken workers had given Geralt a thorough thrashing, they gathered their gear and set off to their destination, which was the building site of the Prophet Lebioda's statue.

   1174935|00000000||Have I gone absolutely cuckoo? Selling all, dirt cheap?!

   1184648|00000000||Oh, dear, what can the matter be, seven old ladies got locked in the lavat'ry…

   1190590|00000000||<i>Thought it was just a pile of rotten meat – till it started to move!</i><br>– Thibaut from Beauclair<br><br>Scurvers are rotfiends’ larger cousins. The bodies of these hideous, vaguely humanoid creatures are covered with rotten scraps of flesh, under which lurk even more rotten muscles stretched around a strong, flexible skeleton. Scurvers, which feed on old, rotting corpses, prefer to make their hunting grounds in abandoned torture sites, forgotten graveyards and old battlefields. They are very aggressive and, though they feed on corpses, if they come across a living person they are likely to attack. Thus when wandering near any of the above-mentioned places, one must be especially cautious.<br>
   1190591|00000000||Scurvers usually feed underground, but sometimes, when they catch the scent of a human, they crawl to the surface in a matter of seconds and attack their potential prey.<br><br>While fighting them one cannot afford to forget about their special boney spines, razor-sharp protuberances sticking out from their skeletons. When a scurver is near death, the gasses and enzymes gathered within its body cause it to explode, flinging these spines out at great speed, turning them into one last deadly weapon in their arsenal.<br><br>To protect oneself against damage from these spines, one should make prodigious use of the Quen Sign.

   1178518|00000000||Geralt paid Regis a visit at his cemetery hideout. After a long debate, the two old friends concluded their first order of business was to find Dettlaff. Regis was to prepare a concoction to aid them in this endeavor. Called Resonance, said brew required an array of ingredients, many of them hard to find. One such component was the saliva, or salivary glands, of a spotted wight, a species thought to be long extinct. Yet it seemed that one specimen remained alive, having made its lair near Beauclair. Geralt set out to find it.<br>
   1178519|00000000||Geralt found the spotted wight at an old, abandoned estate. The witcher slew the monster and, its salivary glands in hand, made for the cemetery.<br>
   1178520|00000000||Geralt found the spotted wight at an old, abandoned estate. The witcher chose not to fight it, opting instead to hide in a wardrobe and await his chance, though how it would come, he could only guess. Once the wight had come and gone, Geralt collected its saliva, which the monster had added to the brew it was making in a large cauldron.<br>
   1178524|00000000||It proved quite the ordeal for Regis, a sacrifice one might say. But they obtained the last ingredient required for Resonance, and the vampire could prepare the concoction. Geralt drank a dose, and visions ensued. He saw Dettlaff, where he had recently been, what he had done. It was enough for Geralt to know he now needed to find a local bootblack. He hoped the boy would help him locate his foe.<br>
   1180500|00000000||Intrigued, Geralt set off in pursuit of the fleeing wight. To the witcher's surprise, the creature proved to be a woman who had been cursed centuries ago. Geralt set about lifting the curse that held her, and through his efforts the wight transformed back into someone of yore named Marlene.<br>
   1189582|00000000||The Beast's and Geralt's clash had been violent albeit brief. Now With it done, Geralt could have a chat with his long lost friend Regis. A higher vampire, Regis revealed that the creature terrorizing Beauclair was none other than his dear friend Dettlaff. Geralt now understood he was pursuing a truly dangerous foe - a higher vampire, one of Regis' ilk. Then the witcher and the vampire heard a clamor. A posse was drawing near. So Geralt and Regis cut their conversation short. Preferring not to draw any attention, the vampire disappeared, but not before inviting the witcher to pay him a visit at temporary quarters he'd established at the local cemetery (you had better believe it!), Mère-Lachaiselongue.<br>
   1178521|00000000||Once Regis received the penultimate ingredient required to brew Resonance, he said the time had come to tackle the most difficult challenge. For apart from all else, Resonance had to include the blood of a higher vampire. At first, Geralt saw this as no challenge at all, as standing before him was a representative of said species. Yet Regis revealed that the blood he needed had to have a specific chemical composition. His blood would change only under conditions of great suffering. Regis offered to endure this without hesitation.<br>

Perhaps one day a bard shall happen upon it and compose from it a ballad to squeeze tears from the most pitiless miser.<br><br>Some time ago I spied a monster roaming in proximity to my estate. Upon further investigation, I learned it was a she-troll, descended from the Gorgon Foothills. I thus scraped together a few crowns and went to the camerlengo, to request he hire a knight errant to slay the monstrosity. Yet as I was making this journey, said she-troll sprang out of the bushes, knelt down by my horse and professed something in the garbled speech of trolls that I took to mean she had chosen me as her beau. Since it is most ill-bred to be rude to a lady, even a monstrous one, I declined her politely and was ready to be on my way when she tossed a sack over me, tucked me under her arm and carried me here, to this clearing. She locked me in a cage and stared at me for hours, sending creeping shivers down my spine… So now I slowly starve to death, for while she gives me clear water to drink, my only food is the soup that she-troll spends all day brewing, a foul concoction reeking of carrion and onion. I would rather perish than put that slurry to my lips…

The lads are glad, too, because finishing off merchants is not at all bad, as work goes – doesn’t tire you much and blood can be washed off. And what loot! Yesterday, for example, a caravan drove through full of barrels of rum and dried ham. Did we ever have ourselves a feast… Which is why I’m telling you, brother, ditch that brothel business and join my band of merry men! I’m sure Mum cries herself to sleep every night, thinking of her son working in a bordello, and it’ll do her heart good to know I’ve got an eye on you.<br><br>Your Elder Brother,<br>Bartolomeu-Martin Tchéhovsky

Give them the barrels. They must be desperate to get this wine, because merely as down payment they’ve handed me a pleasantly heavy pouch… Just be careful, because a pair of those vile rock trolls hunt in the Blessure Valley. How’d trolls end up there, you ask? They were imported! For the tourney, for knights to battle for the crowd’s amusement. Thing is, they fled the transport and began slaughtering their way across the land.<br><br>P.S. Hide the share of the down payment I’ve sent, because if someone finds you with that kind of coin, they’ll start asking questions and our business will end quicker than it began.<br><br>P.P.S.

   1071244|256561ab||Read for additional information.
   1209237|394b22ea||Few know that sound is in fact not just a noise, but a wave - just like the waves of a sea striking against the shore. And just like them, sound waves strike everything in their path, which causes them to break. This particular property of sound is used by some species of animals and monsters as they carry out a kind of terrain mapping using their sense of hearing. Bats, which produce a specific sound to conduct echolocation based on how this sound's waves bounce off potential obstacles, make for a good example of this. Curiously, shaelmaars – mighty, though completely blind monsters – have developed a similar mechanism. They are able to locate their opponents by sensing the vibration of even the faintest sound wave.

   1209261|59a2c942||Hellhounds – Harbingers of the End
   1209260|cfc3ae0a||Some monsters are born out of necessity – not because they are cruel, but because they have to defend themselves. For them, it is hunt or be hunted. Others are simply a mistake of nature, beasts brought to life by an evolutionary hiccup, so to speak. Both these sorts of monsters we are able to fight.<br><br>But there are also monsters born of sin. Wherever there is cruelty and envy, wherever earth has been drenched in blood and rocks soaked in suffering, there the hellhounds have their home. And as cruelty spreads, so, too, shall these monsters. They are the reflection of us and to defeat them would mean to defeat ourselves. All that is left is to wait until we are torn to shreds by hordes of these demonic dogs.

   1209050|f1514f49||Natural Born Killers: A Study of Garkains
   1209051|8a2ad463||Garkains are commonly described as lesser vampires. Do not be misled by this terminology, however, for they are extremely dangerous and devious creatures which men stand no chance of defeating, even when greatly outnumbering the beasts.<br><br>Garkains possess a highly developed sense of smell – once they are on your track, you are as good as dead.<br><br>They have a special taste for adolescents and children, hence the belief that this vampire seeks out only virgins. There is a grain of truth in that, yet it is not a matter of sexual purity, but of the level of blood pollution. The younger and healthier the victim, the tastier a tidbit it makes for a garkain.

   1209222|a5f195b5||In the course of my research into bruxae, I have stumbled upon certain inconsistencies that in no way correspond with what we already know about these dangerous vampires. My investigations have revealed that these seemingly erroneous accounts were in fact describing an alp, not a bruxa! It is an extraordinary discovery, a true milestone in the classification of these monsters.<br><br>Even though legends tell of these vampires turning into pitch black hounds or venomous toads, personally, I do not believe an alp is capable of such polymorphy. However, it is almost certain that, similarly to a bruxa, an alp may transform itself into a beautiful woman. This ability allows the species to blend seamlessly into crowds. To think that I may have passed such a monster completely unawares – fascinating!<br><br>One of the fundamental differences between alps and bruxae is their fighting style when in the form of a vampire. Alps also possess the ability to turn into fog, which allow them to move noiselessly and attack by surprise. Most likely this is the root of the name common folk have given them: "fleetlings."

   1209052|7b1a419e||Bruxae are an incarnation of man’s worst fears.

There is no beast more dreadful than one that can disguise as one of us - a wolf in sheep’s clothing. But there is another reason why bruxae chill our blood - this female creature kindles man's hidden fear of sexuality and of being dominated by a woman.

   1209054|05627713||Monster Encounters of the Third Kind
   1209053|3e6cfad9||I once quarreled with a man who insisted no substantial differences separate spriggans and leshens. The knave riled me greatly, for he had seen nearly nothing of life, yet spoke with the haughtiness of a witcher or other such professional for whom monsters are his stock and trade. One evening at the inn, his blather soured my beer such that I decided to prove to him a spriggan resembles a leshen only in the most superficial ways.<br><br>I thus took him deep into a wild wood and together we walked for upwards of two hours. I recalled having spied a spriggan there a year earlier and had heard the beasts are not fond of changing their place of dwelling. During my previous encounter, I had taken great fright at once and run off as fast as my legs would carry me. Later, I found out that, if undisturbed, a spriggan will rarely attack a human. Unfortunately, during my second encounter I learned the hard way that noise disturbs them. Greatly. When my acquaintance began engaging in loud mockery and cruel ribbing, chortling in raucous laughter all the while, a monster suddenly sprouted out of the ground before our very feet.<br><br>I could take no satisfaction in being proved correct, for the spriggan knocked my unfortunate fool of a colleague to the ground in one powerful blow and then trod him till his innards squirted out of every possible opening. I tried to escape, but it was as if my legs had planted roots in the ground. Meanwhile, the spriggan brought silence to the wood, shot me a stare and then sauntered off, as if nothing had happened.<br><br>That was, I pray, my last encounter with a spriggan and the last time I shall have to explain to anyone why those monsters are different from leshens.<br>

   1208926|4193658a||Fleders are a vile and unsophisticated variety of a vampire. They are unable to run properly, cannot bear direct sunlight and are generally none too wise. Some fleders hunt alone, whereas others prefer to attack in groups. Perhaps it is a matter of instinct – having sensed blood, they assess the size of the victim and, if necessary, summon their kin. The only strong suit of these leeches is their ability to leap towards a potential victim.<br><br>Fighting a fleder is no different than fighting any other kind of bloodsucker. Apart from the obvious means, such as garlic, buckthorn, and sunlight, a hunter should stock up on silver. A lit torch may prove helpful as well.

   1208923|700275b1||Once upon a time, in a small mound near the Vermentino vineyard, there lived a wight named Franconi. Amiable by nature, he spent his days in the mound, cooking various kinds of soups. Not that he was particularly fond of soups – it was his beloved pet, a barghest named Spikey, that slurped them up greedily. And so they sat there, side by side, Franconi the Wight and Spikey the Barghest, cooking soups made of decaying bones, withered weeds and, if they managed to swipe some metal, nails, their favorite delicacy.<br><br>One day Franconi heard two gravediggers talk about a certain man of wealth who kept various kinds of cheese in his cellar. A cheese soup sounded like a delectable treat to Franconi, so he snuck into the noble’s cellar and stole the biggest cheese wheel there was. When he got home, Franconi started slowly melting the cheese in his favorite pot. The stench was so awful Spikey ran off and refused to go back to the mound. To add to the already terrible state of things, the smell of cheese permeated everything, so Spikey and Franconi had to pack their things and move.<br><br>The moral of the story is simple. If you are cooking a cheese soup, make sure the cheese you choose is not blue.

One “scholar,” whose completion of an academic course of study must have been the result of no small miracle, heatedly defended this point of view in a “scientific” work whose title I shall mercifully withhold. His main line of reasoning was an absurd and completely off the mark parallel drawn between the developmental cycles of the slyzard and pieris brassicae, also known as the cabbage butterfly. “A slyzard” – claimed the author – “is nothing but a fully mature wyvern that has developed fire glands.”<br><br>Utter rubbish!

   1209223|4ffd7d0a||If you take a fleder and magnify all of its most primitive traits, you will get a protofleder. This beast, the fleder's distant ancestor, arrived here from a parallel sphere centuries past, yet, unlike the fleder, has remained untouched by any post-Conjunction evolutionary processes. In our time protofleders are extremely rare, the more suitably adapted fleders having taken over their niche in our biosphere.<br><br> Protofleders are thus lesser vampires. Their massive, wide jaws constitute their main weapons, their sharp claws coming in a close second.<br><br>Similarly to their more developed cousins, protofleders rely on their instincts rather than intelligence and are quite sensitive to the scent of blood.

He was a fool and should die like a fool: alone, with no weapon, in a dark alley.

He who should have shown valor in the defense of the innocent, turned out to be the greatest coward of the Beauclair knighthood.

No doubt you wonder why I have drawn you out here, and why we cannot meet in person. You see, in my present situation, any kind of meeting is very risky – not so much for me, as for the person with whom I meet, for I am afflicted by a curse, or (as I hope, and why I have turned to you), the side effects of medicine given to me some time ago by a herbalist.<br><br>Soon after I visited this herbalist, she disappeared without trace. I desperately wish to understand my illness, so I wish to hire you to find her. When you do, learn as much from her as you can about the medicine she gave me. If my suffering is a result of her wickedness, then make her provide an antidote. I assure you I have ample wealth and will reward you with no small part of it for your services.<br><br>If it turns out my suffering is not the fault of the herbalist, please let her go. I will then have a different task for you, because this shall mean I am afflicted by a terrible curse which only the gods can cure. I believe it was cast upon me by a certain beggar who came by the manor while I was hosting a soiree for a few friends. If you can find that vagrant, I will pay you double. Sadly, all I remember of him is that he sold mirrors. I am aware this is not much aid for your hunt, yet I trust in your considerable talents and wish you the best of luck.<br><br>Marlene de Trastamara

   1205968|44b854e3||Biography of the Vampire Regis, From the Quill of Dandelion
   1205969|ce293f09||One of the most extraordinary individuals I have encountered during my numerous adventures at Geralt’s side was the vampire known as Regis. To be precise, he was known as Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy. By his own reckoning, he was 428 years old and was the descendant of unfortunate beings trapped in our world during the Conjunction of Spheres.<br>You are surely thinking, Dear Reader, about katakans alps and other such monsters and are pondering how it was that the witcher – who, it must be admitted, is a slayer of monsters – came to keep such company. I must here explain that Regis was a higher vampire, a creature which physically does not differ all that much from a man. Higher vampires are also much more powerful than their wild confreres, and their regenerative abilities significantly outpace those of anything else you have encountered or can even imagine.<br><br>But it is not because of his outer appearances or inner strengths that Regis became our dear companion. True, he could be pretentious and rather pompous in his frequent length perorations, but one would be hard-pressed to find in him the haughtiness usually present in higher beings.<br><br>Regis valued human life dearly and refused to kill unless forced to do so. As he once confessed, higher vampires do not in fact need to drink blood at all in order to survive. They treat it somewhat as we treat alcohol. A rough grasp of this dynamic might be given to you by the fact that, when we met him, Regis had been abstinent for years.<br><br>He never revealed to us why he decided to join our search for Ciri. He had never met her before. Nor did he live to see her. He died at Stygg Castle, during the battle against the mad mage Vilgefortz, who was responsible for the whole affair. He died for a cause which he surely did not fully understand, but he did it to defend those he held dear and simply because it was the right thing to do.<br><br>I shall always remember him as an rural surgeon reeking of herbs – that is how he came to us during our first encounter at the Fen Carn necropolis, when he treated me and my companions to a fantastic brew he made from mandrake root. Wherever you are, my friend, bottoms up!

   1205985|dacdef43||Battery-Cage vs. Free-Range Humans
   1205987|ab92d7c9||Part two of a treatise entitled Human Husbandry and Care.
   1206896|2b5520a9||(...) In recent decades, many of us have come to believe that a much more effective way of obtaining good quality human blood than hunting individuals is their systematic, controlled husbandry. Apart from the obvious advantages, such as being able to control what the flock eats and the ability to crossbreed specific individuals to obtain offspring with the best hemoglobin, another clear advantage to breeding human flocks is that domesticated humans held in confinement, as opposed to those in their natural habitat (i.e. "villages" and "towns"), become less aggressive, and therefore less troublesome.<br><br>When it comes to farming humans, there are various schools, of which two seem to have gained the widest acceptance in recent times - namely battery-cage and free-range husbandry. This thesis describes in detail the advantages and disadvantages as well as the methods of carrying out each type of breeding. As an introduction, it is worth mentioning the basic differences between both types.<br><br>Battery-cage human husbandry (described very accurately and in detail in the book <i>Human Husbandry</i>) is the placing of several male and female individuals in a closed, restricted space, with permanent access to air, food and water. This form of breeding differs from free range in that the flock is not permitted to leave the breeding area and is held captive the entirety of their lives.<br><br>Free-range, on the other hand, involves leaving the flock in its natural habitat or creating a habitat that simulates it closely (i.e. creating villages, more on which can be found in the chapter - Human Villages: Establishing and Growing a Herd), and then making the herd psychologically or physically dependent on its owner. The most effective method for making a human individual dependent is guaranteeing it safety and permanent access to high quality feed. It is worth adding that a human that trusts its owner does not feel fear and does not defend itself when having its blood drunk, which limits the production of noradrenaline and cortisol, which have a negative impact on the taste of the blood. Furthermore, it may happen that a domesticated free-range human may feel a certain pleasure when its owner drinks its blood (most likely associated with sexual tension), which causes an intensification in the blood's flavor.

   1206001|3dbb8657||Monstrous curses and their description <br><br>Introduction<br><br>Curses that change a fellow into a monstrous creature have existed since the dawn of time. They have a variety of origins and a variety of effects. It normally happens that a mage or sorceress casts a curse and the spell changes the subject. It doesn't always happen straight away. Sometimes, the person who has been cursed changes slowly bit by bit. It also happens that a normal fellow can cast a curse, someone whose conscience is clear and who has done good in their life. Such a person can acquire power and thus the aggrieved can place a curse on the evildoer. Such curses are strong and cannot be removed easily. Thus, everything by which human suffering is atoned is long lasting and painful.

I don't understand. <br>H.B. - You don't know what fear is, sir? <br>E.H. - No. I have mastered your language, yet some concepts are beyond me. What is fear? <br>H.B. - It's a feeling that destroys every other feeling. It controls your head and your heart. <br>E.H. - What do you mean? I thought it was a kind of pain. I have carried out tests in my laboratory on people and I discovered that a mother subject to appropriate stimuli is able to forget about her child and think only about how to avoid pain. So fear would be similar to pain? <br>H.B. - No. Pain rules the body, but fear is born in the heart. <br>E.H. - Oooh yes… What you say is very interesting… I think I will have to examine your heart in the laboratory. <br>H.B. - What do you mean… examine? <br>E.H. - I mean examine. Take it out and subject it to a proper examination. <br> H.B. - But, sir, that would… kill me! <br>E.H. - Yes, your mortality is a great inconvenience, but was not me who created your species and I am not responsible for its excessive frailty. <br><br>The conversation was carried out in human language in such it was written down. The transcription does not need translating.

   1198801|cbe3bf88||Human Husbandry and Care
   1198802|051fb384||The most important aspect of raising human livestock is to provide the herd with conditions that, on the one hand, guarantee their survival, but, on the other hand, do not extend too far beyond the minimum needed for that survival. It should be borne in mind that people are creatures bestowed with great intelligence, or rather cunning and instincts that allow them to gain as much as possible from their environment. In terms of husbandry, this means humans will always try to obtain more than we give them. It is recommended, therefore, to provide each individual with a place to sleep, a meal twice a day and permanent access to water. These conditions, which might seem overly luxurious to some, ensure the optimal production of high quality hemoglobin (more details on diet in later chapters). Also essential is access to air, without which humans die within minutes.<br><br>There is no need to be concerned about the ability for human livestock to multiply in the conditions described above. If they are ensured a minimal existence and male and females are mixed, they will copulate irrespective of whether they are in captivity or not.<br><br>It is worth mentioning here that there is a school of thought that suggests treating human livestock with greater freedom and care, including providing them with better quality fodder and a certain degree of freedom. This allegedly ensures a greater amount of favorable elements in the blood and makes it tastier, however, it is worth mentioning that this method of husbandry is much more difficult and requires emotional bonding techniques, which will be discussed in the following chapters.

   1162005|e678ac46||Janne,<br><br>Dean Marcellus has made it clear that as a specialist in postconjunctive species I am to provide you with all the help necessary in preparing for the trip you are planning. Maybe I will start with a warning: it's pure madness. Assuming that you survive teleportation -- and opening a stable portal several dozen meters above the ground is, as you know, highly risky -- you will then be torn to shreds. As much as Vampires Superiores are actually rational creatures with developed cognitive and analytical functions, other species may be less open to attempts to make contact.<br><br>If by chance you do live to have an audience with this Unseen Elder, do the following immediately: genuflect, say words of greeting in their language -- "eclthi, lautni ama" -- and place on the ground the attached Haakland aragonite crystal as a gift. Then, and only then, is there the slightest chance that you will be heard. But, by the gods, speak quickly and don't waste your words.<br><br>-Jochen Brandt

More tests should allow me to determine whether a passage to our world has really opened up. <br><br>- One hour after arrival -<br><br>I haven't met any vampire's yet, but I can hear their voices.

   1176189|39fb2b4a||-I-<br><br>Syanna gave me a card today with headless blood-stained people on it. I asked why she had drawn it. The princess answered that it was a scene from nightmares that have been haunting her since she can remember. It is true that Syanna awakes each night with a scream - unless she is sleeping in the same bed as Anarietta.<br><br>-II-<br><br>The girls quarreled today. Unfortunately, I must note that they did not behave in a manner becoming for young ladies: there were fisticuffs! Anna Henrietta was first to hit her sister, but Syanna didn't wait long to reply. Before I could break them apart, little Anarietta had lost two milk teeth, and she ran straight to her parents to complain. His Grace the Duke couldn't believe his ears when I told him what had happened. Syanna got the whole blame and was suitably punished. Anarietta then tried to ease the situation, but the Duke and Duchess were resolute.<br><br>-III-<br><br>Today for the first time I accompanied the girls to the Land of a Thousand Fables, where we spent half a day. First we played with Thumbelina and then with Redbeard, who was extremely gallant for a highwayman. I am thoroughly impressed by what the master Artorius Vigo has achieved. He has proved that he has no equal in magical mysteries. The girls said that if I wish to go there by myself, all I have to do is open the book Land of a Thousand Fables and say out loud the spell: Expecto ludum!<br><br>-IV-<br><br>Today, Syanna was tested by the mages sent by the Chapter. I don't know what conclusions they drew, but His Grace the Duke is clearly worried. I asked the Duke what awaits the princess. He didn't reply.<br><br>-V-<br><br>I tutored the girls in Nilfgaardian today. Syanna applies herself so, though she has great difficulty memorizing new vocabulary. Lady Anarietta seems more gifted in this regard, yet also prone to impish behavior. When she thought me out of earshot, she called me a 'bloede kusse.' She and Syanna laughed so hard they almost choked.<br>

   1205372|4b3de703||My Dearest!<br><br>Everything here is good. For several days now the sun has been shining and it is quite hot, so the window in Clarissa's room is open almost all day. If you could see her little face when rays of sunlight hit it... Pure joy. She looks just like she was before the accident. If it gets a bit warmer, I will have her chair taken to the garden.<br><br>The day before yesterday, Master Buyvarde's wife, Elisa, visited us. You remember her don't you? When the Buyvarde's moved to Kovir, all the society ladies were scared of inviting her to dine as she seemed to be either mad or some sort of self-taught witch. This was all because, despite not having the right education, she made magic ointments and cosmetics. It is said that she spent three years in the Dragon Mountains learning from some elven sorceress... <br><br> You know I don't pay much heed to gossip, which is why when the butler announced her, I immediately invited her in for a glass of lemonade. It turns out that she is an exceedingly charming person, and stories of her alleged witchcraft are highly exaggerated -- she actually studied for three years at Aretuza, but because of some bad investments made by her father she had to leave the academy. She left, however, with a good knowledge of plants and their magical applications. She brought with her a healing ointment which I have to rub into Clarissa's legs each morning and evening for ten days. When the treatment is complete, Elisa promises to visit us again to see the results and advise us further. I have a good feeling about this woman. In my next letter, I'll tell you what happened with the treatment she recommended.<br><br>Take care of yourself my dearest. I beg that you don't overreact and do something silly, if something happened to you I wouldn't know what to do.<br><br>I love you,<br>Arabella

To win the approval of his future father-in-law, Gareth had to perform seven challenges.[...]<br><br>The seventh was the hardest. Gareth had to go to Lynx Crag, find the witch who lives there and convince her to lift the drought that plagued the whole land. Everyone, including Daphne, pleaded with Gareth to humble himself before the witch. You see, the witch from Lynx Crag was spiteful and headstrong, even for a witch, and only an act of true humility could break her icy heart.<br><br>Gareth, however, had no intention of bending his knee before a witch. Instead, he planned to force her to lift the curse. Nobody knows what happened on Lynx Crag, but Gareth never returned to his beloved. Daphne stood on the top of a hill and looked for him day and night. Finally, she turned into a tree, so that she may live to see the return of her knight. Such was the strength of her longing and the power of her love.<br><br>Anyone who plunged his axe blade into that tree would see blood run from the wound. Folk started to avoid that place, leaving Daphne in peace to wait for Gareth. In time, all had forgotten about her.

   1208404|e64d7679||Remarks on the Proper Administration of Yarrow
   1208405|3197ab33||Yarrow is, first and foremost, used for medicinal purposes. As mentioned above, when the leaves of this herb are placed against the flesh, they heal all kinds of trauma, wounds and sores. Brew it, and the resulting tincture treats the common cold, colic and loss of appetite. Yet in addition to their healing properties, the branches of the yarrow plant can be used for fortune telling. This method of divination might seem strange upon first glance, but is in truth simple and effective. It truly allows one to focus on the query at hand and gain an answer both accurate and satisfying.

   1208407|334c83d2||The transmutation of bodies is one of the most difficult tasks any mage can undertake – indeed, only the true masters of the Art have ever accomplished it, and even they have only perfected one of its forms. This difficulty arises from psychophysical limitations, since a mage can only safely transform into an animal with which he is perfectly attuned. A famous example is that of Ulf Blackbeard, who dwelled for years in a cave with a bear in order to imbibe the life essence of that animal.

Those wines, why, don’t get me started on Est Est - ever since they started mass-producing it, they should call it Était Était, for it's definitely seen better days.” Then he says, “Right you are, always been a Côte-de-Blessure chap myself.

For Our Prophet has written: “To shun the pleasures of the flesh and shirk from comfort is at times recommended, and to value one’s neighbor’s fortune above one’s own comfort is commendable.”<br><br>That is why we, the Eighth Day Flagellants, scourge ourselves and torment our flesh to ensure all folk of the world enjoy long and prosperous lives. Whatever evil, sickness or misconduct lurks in this world’s dark corners survives not because we have been negligent in striking our backs with the whip!

   1206021|6b9a7378||Dear Gaston,<br><br>In reply to your question regarding the planned transport route for the barrels of tannin, allow me to confirm: the official itinerary supported by the Guild still goes through the lands belonging to Count di Salvaress. The board sees no reason to deviate from our traditional path. The count has pledged to cover all eventual damage caused by the "Great White Terror," so even in the case of the destruction of the entire cargo, the Guild will suffer no monetary losses.

   1206032|9960d1b8||Dearest Mumsy,<br><br>Thank you for the overcoat you sent, it shall surely come in handy.<br><br>I am healthy and in full strength, never worry. What’s more, I have fantastic news: I will be earning a spot of coin! The amount I’ll send you before Saint Barnabus’ Day will easily cover both the repairs to the roof and our debts to the bailiff. I’ve taken on some extra labors: we will build a fence along the edges of a rather expansive wood.<br> Count di Salvaress means to use it to protect his pet from some sort of Reavers and witchers. This pet of his is a basilisk or some other cruel beast, but don’t you worry, I’m safe – the count will bring the creature a cow or a pig or at least a sheep every morn to ensure it is well-fed and shall go straight to sleep. Everyone at court is aghast at this appalling waste of livestock, but a rich man can do as he wishes, I suppose. <br><br>I send you warm embraces and hope you remember if things ever get bad where you’re at, just come join me, I’ve already arranged a position for you with Count di Salvaress, and a nice one, too, indoors. He’s a good man and even honest, for a count.<br><br>Big Kisses, Your Eddie

While browsing through a colleague's book collection, I found mention of one Professor Moreau, of Beauclair, who conducted research into witcher mutations.<br><br>The details I've come to learn are rather vague and his laboratory's location remains a mystery.

   1208937|5857c32f||Before embarking on any consideration of the mutations undergone by witchers, let alone researching them, one should be aware of the specific physiology and biochemistry of these individuals. The transformations they experience during the Trial of the Grasses, which are widely considered to be irreversible, cause witchers to become infertile, while significantly increasing their physical strength and sharpening their senses. The processes also deprive witchers of emotions and human reflexes.<br><br>Although information about the Trial of the Grasses and other transformations to which young adepts of the witcher craft are subjected is strictly protected by master witchers and witcher sorcerers, Ludovic Cèlestin of Ban Ard claims the albumen of gray scolopendromorphs, the strain of giant centipede more commonly known as Pale Widows, constituted the basis of witcher mutagens.

   1206354|356b1bb2||To Whomever Finds This Letter:<br>My names is Julius ban Gavh'e and if you are reading these words, I am surely long dead. As befits one of my station and familial connections I was sent to study at Ban Ard, the famed school for mages, yet I was never to complete those studies. For the entire duration of my life magic held but a weak hold over a soul ravished by a passion for organic alchemy. It was to that most wondrous of sciences I dedicated the most beautiful years of my life, and the table beside which you now most surely stand is the fruit of those labors of love.<br><br>If you are a fellow lover of alchemy, I hazard to guess you will be filled with rapture to behold my discovery. If, however, that marvelous science is unknown to you, please heed my advice – drop this letter, step away from the table and never return. The practice of alchemy by amateurs can lead to injury and even death.<br><br>If you did not drop this letter after that last paragraph, you are no stranger to alchemy – thus I shall now reveal to you in a few brief words the fundaments of the alchemy table I designed. Leaving aside all unnecessary detail, my chief discovery consisted of a formula and tools allowing for the transmutation of mutagens taken from monsters into mutagens of the more common sort. I know this sounds highly unlikely, but I have proven with utmost certainty that this is possible.<br><br>The workings of this transmutation are simple – one must simply make use of the table which I designed. As an expert in the arcane art of alchemy, you certainly already know your way around such devices. If you are but an amateur, a member of the hoi polloi who has by accident wandered to this abandoned place – back away, lest your ignorance do your grievous harm.<br><br>You are surely asking yourself why I hid my discovery from the world, why I did not share my formula with the community of alchemists… Well, let us say I have forever been regarded as eccentric, aloof. And I have always believed it is pure chance and not men themselves that determine destiny. Furthermore, I have never sired offspring and have no desire to entrust my opus to a mere acquaintance. I thus concluded the best solution was to hide my table and trust that chance will – if my theory is correct – bring a man here who shall know how to make use of it, whom it shall delight and to whom it will prove of great use. Whether I am right or wrong – time will tell.<br><br>Use my gift wisely and fare you well,<br>Julius ban Gavh'e, alchemist

Oh well... everyone shall have their turn, as our father would say. I've had a good life and do not regret anything. Well, except perhaps for a few choice cards I lost over the years, but you cannot gain without risking something.<br><br>This very well might be the last letter I write to you, so I'd like you to know I am very proud of you. A gwent tournament using the new faciton, that is the idea of a lifetime. Do not worry about those who oppose your changes - and indeed the notion of change itself. There shall always be malcontents. Those such as yourself should let intuition guide them and follow the path of progress. Where would our world be today if we allowed only the nearsighted, the unimaginative, to steer our affairs? No doubt stuck in a dark cave, with warming fires and illuminating candles beyond our reckoning. Thus I retain high hopes for your tournament and wish it all the best.

   1152323|19ab14a5||30 Birke 1201<br>My fellow captive, Merten, who for so many months kept his neck stiff, mocked my faith in Lebioda and praised the joys of a riotous life, today broke down completely. He admitted he had wasted his gods-given time on pleasures of the flesh and all that he had to show for it were chains and indignities. I tried to lift his spirits, to tell him there is another Path, that he can cast off his past habits and devote his life to Lebioda and His teachings. For now, my counsels have fallen on deaf ears, but I believe he will one day convert and listen to the Truth.<br><br>[illegible entry]<br><br>17 Lammas 1202<br>It is shocking how pleasantly I now converse with Merten. It beggars belief to think we once could not bear each other’s presence! He is a man transformed, metamorphosed! I feel he has accepted his new Path. He devours greedily all I tell him about Lebioda and His teachings. What rapture it is that, in this dank and dark dungeon, the Prophet sent me a sinner and gave my life meaning!<br><br>[blotted entry]<br><br>43 Blathe 1203<br>It is over. Merten has served his sentence and left these accursed dungeon walls. The teachings which I have tried to pass on to him during these last dozen months have clearly taken root: Merten has vowed to go on a pilgrimage which will let him cast off his old ways and open the doors for a new life. As I advised, he will go first to the cave where Lebioda received enlightenment and on whose walls he carved four of his Great Truths. I hope the aura of that place will help Merten, as it has helped many before him, achieve cleansing and gain strength to continue his pilgrimage on to his next station, which I advised him should be… [rest illegible]

I vow to atone for my sins, to walk the path of redemption and rid myself of all that ties me to my old life, so that I may stand proudly among the disciples of the Highest and proclaim myself a new man.<br><br>I shall thus now journey to the Temple of Lebioda, to meet with the Great Beggar, a sage who has pondered the pearls of Lebioda more than any else in this sad vale of tears. I shall listen to his counsel and follow his guidance on my road to absolution.

   1152362|60016d66||7 Feainn 1203<br>The attacks have grown more forceful. The residents of the nearby village who oppose my presence become more aggressive by the day. They do not like that I speak the truth about their former deities. They cannot understand they will only find salvation in Lebioda. They threaten me with death, but if I am to die for Lebioda, if that is the destiny the Prophet has marked out for me, I shall fulfill it with a broad smile on my face.<br><br>14 Feainn 1203<br>I have just parted with a most marvelous guest, a true convert, a man of extraordinary yearning for truth and faith. He is called Merten and was once a witcher but has abandoned that dishonorable trade and embarked on the path of truth. We spoke at length and sat together for hours in meditation and prayer. To better honor Lebioda he left behind here many goods which symbolized his attachment to his former life. He has made great progress – oh, If only all the disciples of Lebioda were so fervent in their faith, this world would be a better place!<br><br>Merten confessed to me the bitter truth about the foul deeds he had wrought in his past life. I told him if he is to obtain cleansing, he must go to the Hidden Chapel. Reaching this bleak place, which is carved out of rock and ridden with dangerous creatures, will in itself constitute a challenge and a trial – if Lebioda lets him enter the chapel’s confines, it means he has forgiven his sins, his crimes. And so Merten went… Let Lebioda guide his feet.<br><br>19 Feainn 1203<br>My fate is sealed. I shall die for my faith, for truth, for Lebioda. This night folk from the village, a band of drunken thugs, attacked the temple. With hate and malice on their breath they cried that since I am the Great Beggar, I should now beg Lebioda for mercy. They looted the temple of all its treasures (thankfully leaving the books, which they deemed worthless) and walled me in to wither in a sealed tomb... If Lebioda does not send me help, I will die here. May my bones bear witness to his glory.
   1153720|b09686cb||Merten's last letter
   1152363|4665fe21||32 Feainn 1203<br>My road has reached its end. I, Merten, having been given as a child to members of the Manticore guild of witchers, having been subjected to their vile mutations and refashioned by their destructive regime of training, do this day cease to be a witcher. I have finished my pilgrimage and divested myself of all that tied me to my old life. I have journeyed to the Hidden Chapel in the Cave of Tribulations and survived. Today, I am born anew. Here, in the Lake of Cleansing, I leave behind the last of the items which signify my attachment to my previous incarnation as a witcher. Along with them I leave behind my cares, my grievances and my obligations. I cast off all that I was, including my name – from now on, I shall answer to Shavel. I am a new man. Thank you, Most Redoubtable Lebioda! <br><br>I feel my new self pushing me onward, to new lands and places which remain hidden from me. The good folk who helped me during my journey always said I must listen to my inner voice and follow it, for it is through that inner voice that Lebioda speaks to us. I shall not go against its will. I will set off, north, to Temeria, Aedirn, perhaps even the Dragon Mountains. I will proclaim the glory of Lebioda and do good deeds – just as the Prophet commanded.

   1152364|89ff0535||17 Feainn 1203<br><br>It is done. I have reached the Cave of Tribulations and stepped into the hallowed confines of the Hidden Chapel. Never shall I forget what I have been through… I was attacked by giant fire-breathing creatures, power monstrosities akin to drowners crossed with endregae, men with the faces of wild animals… Yet Lebioda smiled on me and saw fit to let me survive this harrying gauntlet. At its end – here, in the Hidden Chapel – I surrendered myself to meditation and immediately He filled my mind with a vision of a lake whose crystal clear waters surrounded me, penetrated my soul and cleansed it of all wickedness and villainy… when I awoke, I was certain what Lebioda had designated as the last station on my pilgrimage: the Lake of Cleansing, where Lebioda healed the bodies and spirits of his followers. <br><br>Following the advice of the sage known as the Great Beggar, in whose wisdom I basked at the Temple of Lebioda (I pray all is well with him and the people of his village have understood he only speaks the truth and means them no harm), I shall now leave behind further things binding me to my former life. Doing so is not easy, however, for acquiring these diagrams once cost me a great deal of time, energy and sacrifice. But I know this is the right path. Let Lebioda accept my humble offering.<br><br>I now continue onward, towards the Lake of Cleansing. Though my road is difficult and full of sacrifices, it grows ever more straight and clear and I feel a lightness in my soul. My certainty I walk the right path grows strong as iron, firm as steel.

The witcher you described does indeed seem dangerous – and you yourself always told me they are all freaks and cold-hearted murderers.<br><br>Yet despite all that, I still think you should agree to his offer. If those diagrams truly do outline revolutionary new methods in armor smithing, not only will you be able to complete the contract Her Grace has given you, but you will also earn a great deal of glory for yourself. And that, I know, is what you value above all else.<br><br>Going to the bandits who dwell in the ruins of Arthach Palace for protection is a wise move. If the knights could not get the best of them, a witcher will also feel duly cowed in their presence. Shady miscreants of all types always respect each other.

   1185221|8d486f17||It all went off without a hitch. Bartolomé de Launay proved a poncy fool, just like I thought. Witcher fell right into our trap, too – put too much stock in his skills, thought he could handle anything. At first we acted like bored thugs, just picking our noses and waiting for our pay. When de Launay and the witcher finally came to terms, the witcher let slip he was hiding the rest of the diagrams in the Pits of Brume. Dangerous place, that, but maybe we’ll find some safe route to the witcher’s cache.<br><br>One bolt from the black took care of de Launay. Expected more trouble from the witcher, so we hit him with a couple – good thing, too, because he still had a good heap of life in him, though he couldn’t even get up off his belly. I let the lads check just how much pain a witcher can stomach. They’d earned a bit of recreation after the fine job they’d done. Then we grabbed the coin of de Launay and soon we’re off to the Pits of Brume to get those precious diagrams and sell for all we can.

   1185301|a3c0d60d||The witcher I summoned reached Ussar on the 12th of September. He made a favorable impression. I had expected a cold killer, yet found myself speaking with someone who could easily be mistaken for a normal man – if not for his expansive knowledge concerning the habits of monsters, the two swords on his back and the griffin-head medallion on his chest. Jerome, as he was called, asked me a great many questions about the beast seen near Mont Crane castle. Based on my responses he concluded the monster in question was a leshen.<br><br>During our next conversation the witcher expressed his astonishment at being offered such a high reward, and one paid in advance, before he even arrived in Toussaint. I had taken a liking to the fellow and wanted to be honest with him. Despite the vow I had sworn, I revealed his pay came entirely from a certain Moreau, a mage, who had decided to use this gift to thank our community for a warm welcome.<br><br>When Jerome heard the mage’s name, he first went pale, then flew into a rage. He shouted, and I quote: “Gonna give that old bastard a piece of my mind!”,  then ran to the stables, mounted his steed and rode off, leaving the greater part of his possessions behind. He was seen on the road to Mont Crane, but then disappeared, like a rock thrown in deep water. Master Moreau claims he never saw the witcher.

   1206374|3bd88c84||There were many brave and true knights in the service of the old duke, but the greatest of them all was Luis Alberni. His crest showed a red field with a golden star, each of whose five points stood for one of the chivalric virtues.<br><br>Yet fame and glory went to Alberni’s head. Years passed and he began to think himself the most perfect of all knights.

Alberni thus set off to see her and have her pay him homage in honor of his excellency.<br><br>Yet as Alberni approached the Lady’s home, his body and equipment began to change. The slender knight grew more and more corpulent, until his horse could finally no longer bear him.

All he had left was his helmet, which turned into a wooden cage.<br><br>Alberni stood on the shore of the lake, wishing to speak, yet all that came from his lips was a wild cry. The knight peered at his reflection in the lake’s waters and understood he had become a giant. The Lady of the Lake then emerged and said: You abandoned the chivalric virtues long ago. Of all your sins, the greatest was pride. It has changed your sword into a mace, deprived you of armor and made your flesh into that of a beast. From now on you shall be known as Golyat. Go to Mount Gorgon, where you shall live in this form far from the eyes of men, accompanied by the painful memory of your lost glory, until the day death mercifully frees you from your torment.

He took to rebuilding Corvo Bianco with great zeal. He dedicated the most energy to planting a beautiful garden for his wife, thus starting the craze for the use of herbs which swept Toussaint at the time. After his wife, Bolius’ second love was the olive tree, which is why he planted a great many of them all over Corvo Bianco.<br><br>When Bolius’ wife died, life lost its savor for him and he began to think constantly about death.

   1206235|984c057e||The fiendish slurpers of blood—the vampyres, so-called—the dead and yet alive, called by others—are cunning beasts—verily, some suspect they even reason and converse—yet beasts they remain. These vampyres lead solitary existences—even their beastly and abominable ilk, they shun. The bloodslurpers are not idly named, for the blood of other beings is their bread. They hack apart their victims with sharp claws—daggers, in truth, though of one with their flesh. Upon feasting thus they grow in foul force and can turn into flying rats—gaining these animals’ keen hearing and also a sense of smell to match that of hound or hind.<br> <br>It is our luck seasoned hunters of bloodslurpers know ruses with which to trick these horrors and slay them without excessive risk. To kill a vampire easily and surely, it is enough to lure him into the light of the sun. He will then disintegrate into a fine dust at once, ready to be scattered to the four corners of the earth by the next gust. Yet well-advised is it to further equip oneself with garlic, lest the horror crawl too close and strike out at the hunter with its dagger-claws. Vampyres fear garlic with all-consuming terror—the mere smell of it reduces them to violent heaving and sobbing. In this moment should the hunter pound into the beast’s heart a sharpened stake—the second best weapon (the first being the sun) for the killing of the bloodslurpers.
   1206236|8e5d86fe||The History of Est Est
   1206237|440625ce||Est Est, often considered one of the chief treasures of the people of Toussaint, is the best known of the wines cultivated in that region. It is hard to determine when, exactly, the first barrels of Est Est were matured, though we can surmise it must have been around the time of the first human forays into the duchy’s present lands. What is certain is that this wine truly gained fame only during the reign of Duchess Adela Marta, who held Est Est in near divine esteem and for that reason bestowed upon Castel Ravello the privilege of being the official ducal vineyard. She also reserved a special place in the cellars of the Beauclair Palace for Est Est, and to this day two barrels of every vintage are ceremoniously deposited on those shelves. The tapping of any of them is, by order of the ducal edict “Vino Sanctus Est,” punishable by death through dragging behind a team of horses.
   1206245|827c690b||A Short History of Pomino
   1206246|f01383e1||Though Pomino does not enjoy the fame of Est Est or even Erveluce, it still attracts a considerable number of admirers and remains among the best wines in the world. Few, however, know how close the world came to losing its slightly acrid, surprisingly deep aftertaste. The cause of this averted disaster was Phylloxera Mortifera, that is to say, Phylloxera the Deadly, a species of aphid whose sudden attack nearly wiped out all existing vines of this variety. For many weeks no one was able to exterminate this pest and it seemed Pomino was doomed to extinction. In the end, however, the aphids were defeated by ducal alchemists and a carefully selected group of vintners was appointed to ensure its vines took root at Castel Ravello once more. Some experts from the time of the plague claim their restoration efforts introduced cross-contaminants and never again were they able to extract from this grape that same bottomless flavor as before.

   1164685|04d3ab7e||Mt Dearest Anarietta, Rose of the Desert, Flower of Heaven!<br><br>Please forgive me for not writing for so long - but, bearing in mind you drove me out, accusing me of, and I quote, "treason, crimes against the state and sullying the dignity of our noble stature through perjury, libel and slander, as well as revelry, lewdness and debauchery," I wasn't sure if you would want to read my epistles.<br><br>In the end, though, I decided to break my silence. It turns out, my dear Ermine, that I have been invited to the Festival of Ballads that is to take place this autumn at the picturesque Villa Vedette within your demesne. I would willingly grace that event with my presence and talent, yet I am not able to cross the border of the duchy until you revoke the judgment making me persona non grata in Toussaint. May I ask you for a pardon?<br><br>By the way, I'd like to assure you once again that my alleged romance with Baroness Nique was simply an unfortunate misunderstanding. I have always been faithful to you in heart, body and mind.<br><br>I await your reply,<br>-Julian Alfred Pankratz de Lettenhove vel Dandelion

This is an event renowned the world over and the lack of a representative of our order is a glaring omission and casts a dark shadow on the reputation of our Order.<br><br>Sadly, ever since the death of Brother Roderick de Wett, we have no worthy champion, and our most skilled brother, Patrick of Weyze, has contracted scrofula so fierce he cannot mount a horse even for a minute.<br><br>We thus trust the choice of you, brother, which is natural in this situation, will prove wise and you shall not betray the hope we have placed in you.<br><br>Immediately upon receipt of this letter go to the nearest branch of the Vivaldi Bank, where you will accept a transfer of coin in the amount of 784 crowns. These are your delegation funds, which you are obliged to return in full plus a 50% penalty if you do not take a place on the podium. Brother Adalbert, who – as you know – has taken on the role of specialist in the matters of the Order’s view in the public eye, has calculated that a loss on the part of our representative will cause more damage than not taking part in the tourney at all. So you understand our position.<br>May the Eternally Flaming Rose lie your path in this endeavor!<br><br>Brother Evariste of Metinna, First Secretary of the Order

Despite my asking you not to do so. Twice in a row you begged coin from me for the journey, boasting with confidence you would win the tourney if you could but have a new horse, armor and sword. Twice in a row I gave in to your pleading. This year I forbade you from going, yet I see I merely rule my realm, not my own son.<br>Enjoy yourself, but know that your monthly allowance ends today.

It soon became clear, however, that for the ambitious Amadeus, this was just the beginning. He quickly expanded the business, establishing Cianfanelli Bank branches in Kovir and Nazair and even sending a representative to Zerrikania. He became known for treating each and every customer as an old friend and cared deeply about what became of others’ coin. He thus created a wide range of banking products to better allow him to look after the property of an increasingly greater number of customers. He coined the phrase that up until today has served Cianfanelli as an advertising slogan and motto: “We look after your coin as if it were our own.”

   1147983|01dc5980||In our lands - that is to say, in the fair Duchy of Toussaint - the hunting of basilisks has a long and storied tradition, one reaching back to the dawn of our present history. Attesting to this is a note written by one Xenon of Trytion, a leatherworker, in the year 1023. In it one finds mention of a commission for a corset, to be fastened from “hide of that winged serpent, called basilicus by some” (see Vedetto Fiari, <i>Manuscripts through the Ages</i>, 1278). While lesser hides could come from beasts felled by age or hunger, the costliness and expanse of this corset would have necessitated the skin of a basilisk taken in its prime - and therefore required a hunt.<br><br>Without the engagement of a witcher, or, as a last resort, a knight or a mercenary, such a hunt would have perforce meant the gruesome death of the foolhardy hunter.<br><br>Yet those adept at the task - witchers chief among them - hunted basilisks and their cousins, cockatrices, with great success, thinning their numbers till a mere handful remained.<br><br>To give but one example, in the year 1100 basilisks of the <i>regulus platinum</i> subspecies dotted skies all across our land, yet in the present day only one exemplar still lives.
   1207796|5a422f84||The Civil War in Toussaint
   1207797|d973e108||The year 781 marked the final end of elven rule in Toussaint – the closing of an era that had lasted over one and a half thousand years.<br><br>The elves abandoned their ivory cities and left for the mountains, taking with them all that they could and destroying everything else. Whatever they could not take and did not manage to demolish or burn, they cursed.<br><br>The last elven sovereign, Divethaf, hundreds of years old yet fair as a youth, was defeated. Weeping over the slain army of his forever-young brothers and sisters, he agreed to pay homage to Ludovic, the first human king of Toussaint (who, though young, was as shrunken and ugly as the night after Saovine).<br><br>Putting on no end of airs and graces, Ludovic boasted, “Look – the proud elf shall bow down before me and kiss my royal feet with humility!” To degrade Divethaf even further, Ludovic decided the homage should take place in the elf king’s barely-abandoned palace. The throne on which Ludovic now boldly lounged bore still-smoldering marks from the fire set by the elves, who had sought to burn the whole palace down as they left.<br><br>So the proud elven king bowed down before the human king and offered him a sacrifice of bread and wine, as well as his sword and shield.<br><br>Spewing out merciless mockery all the while, Ludovic received this homage, then immediately ordered his guards drag Divethaf beyond the palace gates and throw him down the stairs as if he were a beggar.<br><br>Witnesses claimed the proud elf remained calm throughout the whole event, but when left alone, Divethaf wiped the blood off his face and vowed cruel revenge on the king – revenge that would come from stone as cold as the king’s heart.<br><br>Yet these ominous words bore no fruit, for in the year 782, before the homage was renewed, Divethaf drew his last breath alongside his remaining soldiers when the Toussaintois decided to celebrate the anniversary of the surrender of the elven sovereign with a pogrom of non-humans on the slopes of Mount Gorgon. Few survived.

   1206024|42d728db||Sangreal (alternatively Sang Real, literally Royal Blood)<br>The legendary line which some trace back to the first lords of the lands now lying in Toussaint and northwestern Haakland. The first mention of Wilhelm the Bold, this line’s founder, comes from elven manuscripts found during reconstruction of the Beauclair palace in 1095. Since this source, like all things elven, is unreliable and should not be taken into consideration by historians, the existence of House Sangreal must be considered a mere fable.<br><br>Salvaress (or Salvarez), di, of the <i>regulus platinum</i> crest. This line takes its name from Salvar the Lame, who was made a count in the year 1189 by Duchess Caroberta for his service to the ducal throne. The di Salvaress line’s crest depicts a <i>regulus platinum</i>, one of the so-called silver basilisks whose existence is highly suspect, its classification as a species considered erroneous by most zoologists.<br><br>Toricella of the Two Towers crest. An ancient line whose founders most likely first settled the lands of present-day Toussaint around the year 984. They waged fierce war against the elves until the 6th decade of the 11th century, when all of what is now Toussaint fell under human control.
   1206026|d83703ae||The Last Basilisk of its Kind: A Study in Ecology, by Borhis di Salvaress
   1206027|ff0f171e||Based on my observations, I have concluded all species, be they plant, animal or even insect, are inextricably intertwined with one another. It is no mere coincidence the felling of the beech woods and the vanishing of the roes who in them once dwelled led to the disappearance of the sterling basilisks as well!<br><br>The principle even holds true for ladybirds.<br><br>For the betterment of learning, I conducted the following experiment: I eradicated all the aphids in the palace cabbage patch (using a lye solution). Within a few weeks, all of the ladybirds once present in that patch – and there were hundreds – migrated to a neighboring field. A simple experiment, yet it gave incontrovertible proof of my hypothesis!
   1206321|0476d1cf||Gwent: A History
   1206322|60cff59d||Gwent: for many a diverting game of cards, for others, a noble pursuit, for some – a crippling addiction which devours their every coin and every waking moment. These last can be found most frequently among the dwarves, the game’s inventors and most passionate devotees. Their devotion extends to gwent’s paraphernalia, its cards most of all, which they craft with great care and skill - in fact, cards painted by dwarven masters are often considered miniature works of art. In past times they devoted equal attention to whittling the clubs which contestants once kept at their sides, to bash each other about the head with in the case of an argument. As brawls grew less common, the clubs became implied threats more than used weapons, until eventually falling into disuse and near oblivion.<br><br>Today gwent players can be found almost everywhere, from the Skellige Isles (where the game was introduced by the druid Ermion) to the Northern Realms and the Nilfgaardian Empire.<br><br>In gwent, the play of cards mimics the dueling of two armies. The playing field is divided into two parts, each split into three rows. Nearest to the center stand units who fight at close quarters, behind them, archers and other such ranged attackers, and furthest back, machines and creatures used for siege purposes. Both players wield decks made up of a minimum of 22 unit cards and a maximum of 10 special cards, and each must also contain a leader card. The player who wins the toss of a coin (originally: the dwarf whose wife has the longest beard) plays first. Each player draws at random 10 cards from his deck and then is allowed to redraw 2 of these before the laying of cards begins. Each round is won by the player who has played cards of the greatest value. The first to achieve 2 victorious rounds wins, meaning a maximum of 3 rounds are played. The winner’s prize is agreed upon by the players before each match – most often, the wager is a bounty of coin or a rare card<br><br>The heart of the players’ armies, the unit cards, come in three types:<br>close combat units,<br>ranged combat units,<br>siege units.<br><br>Each such card is assigned a strength rating and may additionally possess special abilities.<br><br>There are also special cards which have no strength rating but instead influence the course of the game in other ways.<br><br>Unit cards depicting famed heroes not only have unusually high strength ratings, but also have the added benefit of ignoring the workings of all special cards. These are the rarest and most coveted of gwent cards. Most frequently they must be won from top players or purchased at a great price from collectors. <br><br>The cards in classic gwent are divided into four factions:<br>The Northern Realms, leader: Foltest<br>The Nilfgaardian Empire, leader: Emhyr var Emreis <br>Monsters, leader: Eredin Bréacc Glas<br>The Scoia'tael, leader: Francesca Findabair.

   1206719|16816aa3||Some halfbrains have been wandering around near Mont Crane. They call themselves knights errant, but I call them swill-slurping miscreants. No idea what they’re looking for here, no windmills around for them to charge, but those addled anklebiters dream up mad ideas no normal man would ever contemplate. No matter what they’re up to, they’re to stop it. The best way to take care of a knight errant is to cut off his head. If anyone brings me such a head, he can count on a plump pouch of coins.

   1206937|967e1fa5||Notes by a vandaguilder from Filibert's hanse
   1206938|cd7ddd87||I’d always enjoyed practicing my craft. Killing came as naturally to me as blowing my nose. They raised me to be a knight, and being a brigand’s not much different. First, blood and swords, then wine and harlots to wash the worries away. But ever since that horrid night… everything has changed. My dreams are filled with nightmares in which I relive those events, step by step…<br><br>We took the estate by storm and pulled Maximus Macrinus out of his bedding, still in his nighties. Yet we had to put off dealing with him and first see to his family. Those were our orders, like it or not, but… it’s one thing to impale some corpulent cow-diddler with a wine-stained mustache and quite another to string up a snot-nosed runt. He squealed like a little girl when the lads threw the noose around his neck. Macrinus tried to buy us off – even showed me the candlestick lever that opens the hidden vault where he hides his family treasures, but Filibert’s orders were clear.<br><br>Next up was Maximus’ wife… the lads spent a long time having their way with her and making Maximus watch. Too long. I didn’t know the harlotsbrood and haven’t a clue what he did to Filibert to make him wish such a fate on him and his family, but… That was too much for me. Only once his whole clan was swinging did we turn our attention to Macrinus. We stuck him with hot pokers, cut off his ears, then slit his gut… and he… throughout all this horror he didn’t scream once. Only groaned under his breath. When it came time for him to die, in a puddle of his own excrement, under the tree where we’d hanged his wife and son… he looked me in the eyes and whispered, “Vengeance will be mine! In this life, or the next!” Those were his last words. Dark clouds filled the sky in that instant, and a harsh gale sprung up… Then I gave the order to move out.<br><br>I remember perfectly how, when I reported this back to Filibert, he was all smiles. Happy as a clam. Didn’t even harangue me for not looting the manor. It was clear he cared about one thing, and one thing only: Macrinus’ death.<br><br>Yet news of the treasure we left at Casteldaccia quickly spread around Mont Crane and a few lads from our hanse are fixing to head over there to see what they can find. I’ll join them. I’ll bury the remains still lying there, in the yard – maybe then their spirits will know peace. Maybe I’ll wipe away at least some of my sins. Maybe at last I’ll be able to sleep soundly.

Since Quayle means to diddle our derrières, let’s diddle Quayle. Grab him, scorch his heels and find out where he’s hid his share of the previous raid.

   1209952|6bd86ca9||Letter from Regis
   1209954|ac5f1303||Dear Geralt,<br><br>If you are reading these words, it means I am already far beyond the borders of Toussaint and you have found my Mutagenerator. (Of course, you may dub this instrument however you like, perhaps something more fitting to your taste or better reflecting its function, for I have no doubt your knowledge on the subject of mutagens is far more profound and thorough than mine!)<br><br>I have been working on this device in my spare time, but now it is finished and I am convinced – as convinced as an inventor can be before his invention has been used as intended – of the usefulness of this apparatus.<br><br>You are surely wondering what function it is meant to serve. As the name indicates, the Mutagenerator generates mutagens. It operates by absorbing electromagical energy waves from bodies (in this case, the bodies of the monsters and evil-doers you kill) – and when it has absorbed enough so as to be charged a critical amount, the Mutagenerator changes the stored energy into a Greater Mutagen – which, I suspect, you will make good use of. <br><br>As you surely understand, I am an amateur engineer, which is why you must forgive the lack of an ability for you to direct this operation. Which mutagen emerges as a result is determined at random, meaning chance will decide if it is a Green, Red or Blue Mutagen. Chance – yet I have noted the colors tend to alternate, by and large.<br>I trust you shall find my gift useful.<br><br>Your dearly devoted friend,<br> Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy<br><br>P.S. You might be wondering why  I decided to toss the Mutagenerator into your home instead of simply handing it to you in person. Well, you must know I did it out of modesty. Believe it or not. <br>Take care, Geralt – and may my gift serve you well.

We never got our share for knocking over that jeweler Maathenberg’s shop, so burying Selina with all the loot is pure jackassery! Those treasures belong to us all. Let’s meet up and split things in an honest fashion. Then you can go drown yourself in the lake or hang yourself from any branch you choose.<br><br>Robin

Holy Lebioda must have given me a kindly wink today, or perhaps it was mere chance and circumstance – the important thing is, I’ve found a cave that will make a perfect wine cellar! Production’s been going wonderfully the last few seasons and lack of storage space has become a pressing issue. I could have hired men to dig a cellar, but I’d hate to slow work on barreling the grapes, and at any rate, no dug out cellar can match a limestone cavern.<br><br>The one I found is perfect – spacious and not at all overly damp. And I came across it thoroughly by accident, while strolling among the rocks. My foot slipped into a crevasse, and when I tugged it free a few stones fell down into it. I listened for a long while before I heard them hit the bottom. I then walked around the entire slope until I finally found an entrance!<Br><br>Tomorrow we will begin turning it into a storehouse and transferring the barrels.<br><br>[Later entry, consisting of hurriedly scrawled entries] Monsters in cave. Huge centipedes. Men barely escaped. We’ll try to go again, recover what we can. Must block off all entrances. Hope no one else ever stumbles into that accursed cave…

That’s why I’ve put Carlo in charge of drilling the new recruits. He’s pitched camp to the south of Lynx Crag – that rock where the witch lives.

If it’s true, perhaps I’ll gather up a gaggle of those peasants, put them to work digging up that pottery and we’ll open up shop. Every organization’s got to stay nimble and agile these days. So we’ll pivot, instead of slaughtering merchants and knights – we’ll sell teapots!<br><br><br>Day 182<br>Felt like my spirit was trying to crawl out my bum, that’s how badly our kitchen crew botched our last batch of vittles.

Since when do the Aen Seidhe care for the graves of their loved ones? Yet living among people necessarily means we take on some of their customs. While there, I happened to learn the humans plan to build a village near Crevan Carn. This is difficult, for personally it does not bother me, but Bláthnaid – you know her – began screaming about how this was a profanation and they have countless other perfectly good spots where they could build their village. I hope this will not grow into some larger conflict, we have it so good here… [rest of the letter is illegible]

I came across a highly interesting note in the archives. And, along with it, a key. The key is the more interesting find, because according to what I could decipher from the dust-covered scribblings on the note, it opens a chest full of gold coins! But I’m getting ahead of myself.<br><br>While doing some routine straightening of the files, I found a report outlining procedures for the reform of Bastoy Prison – orders straight from Duke Henri Gras. We all are aware how badly this experiment ended, for the ruins of that prison to this day frighten any potential “tourists” with their battered skeletons and legends about howling spirits of the murdered guards. Yet I did not know that hiding among the abandoned ruins there was a chest, and that its key was lying right under my nose! The chest supposedly contains crowns meant for the purchase of books and rations for the inmates of Bastoy. One of the clerks employed here at the time committed a sin of omission and sent the chest to the warden without the key. Yet perhaps that was for the best? The warden was impaled and the guards all skinned alive, meaning those degenerates would have also got their hands on the chest, had he received the key. As it is – might the chest still be there, unopened?<br><br>Folk say a curse has fallen on that place, a dark power brought down by the bestiality of the murders it beheld, but folk also say an Ofieri will become emperor of Nilfgaard and herald the end of the world, so there’s not much point giving any of such jabbering much credence.

   1207914|ebc77843||[Journal is completely soaked, only a few entries can be deciphered]<br><br>Belhaven, 23rd Day of service<br>Nothing irritates me more than land rats thinking they’re cock of the walk. Yet Count Jean-Joel Baillairgé – that’s what the impertinent prick made me call him –managed to assuage my irritation a dab by clinking a hefty pouch of Nilfgaardian florens on the table... [illegible fragment] ...his entourage loaded the ship with bundles, then hauled on this huge cage covered with a sail. Count Baillairgé explained it held one of those famed Zanguebarian striped horses – a gift for Duchess Henrietta.<br><br>Belhaven to Beauclair Route, 24th Day of Service<br>We’ve had nothing but trouble with this Zanguebarian horse! It gnaws on the deck like a beast gone mad. Plus we’ve got to make sure the tarp covering its cage is tightly fastened, for it seems this creature’s as sensitive to the sun’s rays as a vampire! In which case, what good’s it to the duchess, a striped horse she can only ride it at night? There’s no comprehending these aristocrats… [illegible fragment]<br><br>Belhaven – Beauclair Route, 25th Day of Service<br>A thousand thundering sea devils! That was no horse in that cage, but a gods-blasted shaelmaar! Overgrown rock rat chewed through the deck, capsized the ship and burrowed into the river bottom! Then that idiot Count Baillairgé fell to his knees and begged me to help catch the monster. He handed me the key to the chest of jewels he’d kept close watch on the whole trip and swore it’d be mine if we recaptured that monstrosity. I’d most like to grab a thick club, smack him upside the head and take that chest right now, but I’m not some ploughing pirate. I’ll gather the lads who managed to survive the wreck and we’ll try to catch the monster in our nets – the count claimed to know some trickery to use to sneak up on the beast...

   1194396|56e2c582||If our fearless leader Starling Straggen’s going to write everything down in his notebook, why, then I’ll do the same! And I’ve plenty to write about, for the way we pillaged and plundered the Silver Salamander till it looked a pile of dank diarrhea was positively epic! Whole hanse had been fixing for ages to make a jaunt over to that tavern. For how long can you sit twiddling your thumbs at a place as foul as the ruins of Arthach? Water up to our ankles, fungus everywhere and the wind blowing so fierce our bums pucker. Why the dead-dong-diddle stick around? So we didn’t! We got our doodoo together and went to work! Hit them so hard, before they figured out what was going on, half of them had already been hacked apart! It was over in a flash. In fact, we got so carried away, not a living soul was to be seen when we were through, though it seems a few managed to scatter into the woods, including that blasted Nilfgaardian owner, but we’ll see to tracking down survivors later. Meanwhile, we’ll drink a bit, sing a bit, and then head out for a good hunt… So, there you go, my memoirs, signed me, vice-head of the hanse, Speedy Eugene.

We’ll apply finish to the chestnuts as soon as they’re back from leaching. Don’t let any lads go out to work alone – send them out in twos at the least.

   1206174|9a3e2998||Dearest Cousin,<br><br>Based on what I gathered from your last letter, rumors about Belgaard’s overtaxed condition are not exaggerated. In my opinion, there’s no point you waiting for the new owner. The procedures involved in transferring such an important vineyard will last months, and meanwhile the estate will fall into ruin. You wrote you had to fire all the vineyard’s guards – who will now protect you from wild animals? You know full well how many of them lurk in the Caroberta Woods! They could attack you at any moment! I worry for you. I’ve already spoken to Master Fabricio and he thinks a skilled steward such as yourself will quickly find work over here.

   1025838|ae33ddfb||The reasons for choosing Jacques de Aldersberg as Grandmaster remain a mystery. The Order of the White Rose had gone through a crisis in those times and was on the verge of collapse, so one might guess that the brethren wished to have someone decisive as their leaders, someone with a clear vision. De Aldersberg was precisely such a man. One of his first decisions was to change the brotherhood's name to the Order of the Flaming Rose.<br><br>The most puzzling aspect, however, is that the order and the king himself decided to trust a man who, for all intents and purposes, had appeared out of nowhere. They say he was a wanderer, an itinerant priest who moved crowds with his speeches declaiming nonhumans. They say he worked miracles and showed his flock visions of a world destroyed by the White Frost. He was undoubtedly a man of great charisma, one instilled with unshakeable principles which he in turn tried to instill in others.<br><br>Was he truly a Source? Was he indeed gifted with raw magic talent? That we will never know for certain.

   1211291|43c32c43||Dear Jean-Louis.<br><br>As you instructed, I have taken a post as Assistant Royal Hairdresser to King Tancred Thyssen and have been active in that position for two months.<br><br>I dash this note off to you now because I must inform you of a most startling development. After weeks of analysis, consultations with specialists and trial runs on model doppelgangers, the Chief Royal Hairdresser, Master Hector, has decided to give Marziaola, the king’s current favorite, a… bob! Of course, Marzaiola, being a mere king’s mistress, cannot indulge in such extravagances as an asymmetric bob or an daringly shaved nape, therefore her bob is rather of the classically elegant sort, with a fringe that wonderfully complements the line of her eyes and covers her altogether unfortunate forehead.<br>Just as we speculated, the bob shall soon make a triumphant reentry as the absolute rage of the royal salon, and thanks to me, you, my dear friend, are now the first hairdresser of the South to know about it! I thus declare my mission accomplished and a stunning success! I’ll gather up my trappings and prepare to return. I hope you are ready for a long and eventful tête-à-tête once I arrive, and I hope that will be soon, for this seaside climate really does not suit me one bit, and this swill they call wine in Kovir is positively disgusting.<br><br>Warm Embraces,<br>Edgard Lavalliere

   1208761|45fc611d||During a visit to the court of the king of Nazair, Waltharius the Brawny fell madly in love with the king's daughter, the beautiful Hiltgunt, who was already promised to a prince from Metinna. Waltharius, paying no heed to these politically-inspired marriage plans, captured the princess’ heart and together they ran off to Toussaint. The prince from Metinna, unable to let such an affront pass, followed the star-crossed lovers. Yet Waltharius was renowned for his courage and might and thus slew his adversary with ease. Then he and his beloved returned to his family estate at Dun Tynne.<br><br>To his dismay, it turned out his brother Vislavius had nearly led the estate to bankruptcy while Waltharius had been in Nazair. Waltharius threw his brother into the dungeon and, as befits a self-respecting nobleman, embarked on a knightly expedition. Unfortunately his young wife, Hiltgunt, tortured by her solitude, freed Vislavius and became his lover. When Waltharius returned and realized he had been cuckolded, he murdered them both in a fit of passion and despair. Then he sat down and wept and wept and wept…

   1208763|02e0c85b||…While in the stunning duchy of Toussaint, one should not forget to visit Castel Ravello, whose grapes lend their vibrant flavor to wines such as Erveluce, Fiorano, Pomino and the famous Est Est. Should white wine be one's beverage of choice, I wholeheartedly recommend the excellent offerings of two fiercely competing vineyards, Coronata and Vermentino. If one seeks Beauclair White, popular in the North, one should seek out the Castel Toricella vineyard, which produces and exports it. Unfortunately, a severe economic crisis led to the bankruptcy of several distinguished vineyards such as Corvo Bianco, known as Gwyn Cerbin in the Elder Speech (oh, their supreme Sepremento…!) and Tufo. Let us hope each and every one of them finds a passionate new owner who will restore them to their former glory…

   1208765|692756d4||…For those who find the wines of the Sansretour Valley too dull, I strongly recommend the lesser-known but still outstanding brands produced in the Blessure Valley. Let us start with the amazing Côte-de-Blessure, produced at the Pomerol vineyard. I particularly recommend the 1260-1263 vintages, with their distinctively rich flavor. Looking elsewhere, the nearby Zurbarrán castle offers the dry Castel de Neuf, whereas Nuragus and Sancerre, located in the northern parts of Toussaint, specialize in red wines and, jointly, produce and export the wine known in the North as Toussaint Red. Exquisite rosé wine could once be found at Casteldaccia, but ever since its owner tragically passed away, the vineyard has fallen into decay…

   1208886|c0695864||In the northwestern region of the duchy of Toussaint, past the Blessure River, there lies the forest of Caed Myrkvid – a druidic sanctuary which, as the result of treaties signed with the duchy's rulers, enjoys full autonomy in its internal affairs.<br><br>The forest is one of the main reserves of the Beauclair oak – a significant component of the local cooperage industry. With ecological balance in mind and following agreements between the Coopers’ Guild and the flaminica (the leader of the circle), oak felling in the forest is currently subject to strict supervision.<br><br>In 1267, when the flaminica granted asylum to druids from Caed Dhu in Angren, fighting broke out within the sanctuary. The bandits who tried to escape justice in the forest were burnt alive in wicker hags to set an example. Since then, the borders of Caed Myrkvid have been protected by strong magical barriers and, to be honest, I would not recommend visiting this region without an invitation from the flaminica.<br><br> From Petrin Falesand's Guide to Toussaint

   1208940|088f99f0||…Where have all the heroic and selfless knights gone? Are the truly noble, like Ramon of Gichon or Martinus de la Pacque, a thing of the past now? Though they maintain a facade of independence and altruism, the knights errant of Toussaint of our day are paid, and by the Duchess herself! So I ask – is that noble? Is that dignified?! Should a knight, a nobleman after all, receive payment for his heroic deeds?! Is he but a mercenary or, pardon my Nazairi, a ploughing witcher? Shouldn’t the tears of joy of a rescued damsel suffice as a reward? I simply cannot understand it! To paraphrase the weighty words of the wise Renè de Hospitalier – such fools, these Toussaintois.

   1209937|5997f6a7||…Nowhere else in the entire world can one find better preserved relicts of the glory days of the Aen Seidhe. Naturally, by "the entire world," I in fact mean the areas that have entered man’s jurisdiction – Toussaint’s architecture obviously could not hold a candle to the wonders of Dol Blathanna. That is in no way meant to detract from the glory of the ruins of Termes, the old amphitheater or Arthach, the one-time summer residence to Toussaint's kings. More than any of these, however, it is the palace which captures one’s eye with its… [torn page]<br><br>…spacious terraces seemingly enclosed by openwork exedras with rows of intricate tracery and pinnacles crowned with spiked crockets. One may admire them through legions of ogival windows, the traceries of which are often decorated with the floral ornaments so typical for the culture of the Aen Seidhe. This style is especially prominent in its buttresses and niches.

What’s key is for folk in the village keep their mouths shut tight. They do that, how will anyone find out he even made it to Fox Hollow? He could’ve been killed by vandaguilders along the way, could he not? Just go tell Séverin to pour quicklime down that hole and drop in a torch, just in case. Quicklime, that’ll do the trick, turn both that smarty-trousers’ body and those old skeletons into molten sludge in a snap. For who the bumblazes knows when the next scholar will show?

   1209964|2f3e4695||The Fall of Hubert Balaste
   1209965|1e708c97||In the sun-drenched duchy of Toussaint, near the Coronata vineyard, lay the estate of Baronet Hubert Balaste, an honorable knight in the service of Duchess Ademarta. Hubert served as a knight errant for many years and vows were his greatest delight. He swore to do things so grand they curdled blood of other knights. The duchess finally recognized his courage and not only awarded him with an honorary title, but also granted him land. Hubert thus had a place of his own on which to settle down and wait till his time came with dignity. He could find himself a wife and sire descendants as befits every self-respecting hero.<br><br>Unfortunately, once he had lain down his sword and shield, Baronet Balaste began to seek other diversions. And so he indulged in games of card and dice – and at times even bet on dog fights. Then, one day, when fortune abandoned him, he decided to bet not one or two gold pouches, but in fact his family’s entire estate. And he lost. Everything. To add to this already unhappy state of affairs, Hubert Balaste, who was not one to take defeat lightly, flew into a fit of blind passion, donned his armor and enlisted at once. Fortune alas smiled no more favorably upon him at war than it did at play, and an arrow found its way to Hubert’s leg. Then he died of gangrene.

My salary as a scribe was so laughably meager I was reduced to borrowing coin from my mother. I was a thief, but I also did a great deal of good for the palace library! Who secured the import of such tomes as <i>The Lives of the Prophets</i>, <i>De Haemorrhoidibus</i>, <i>The Art of Midwifery for Maidens</i> and many others? The palace library has me to thank for <i>The Storehouse of All Knowledge Needed for a Merry and Satisfied Life</i> and other rare tomes, such as <i>Speculum Aureum</i> and <i>De Larvis Scenicis Et Figuris Camicis</i>.

   1207955|8faabd29||Journal bound in worn leather
   1207956|79eb1283||I am Filibert von Wittan, my Crest – a Rook, my father – the famed Sir Gruber “Palecheeks” von Wittan. Today I was smeared by an insult which only blood can wipe clean. Rage burns my entrails. Writing this is the only way I know to calm the flames.<br><br>When I am an old man and read these notes, I believe a certain Maximus Nonius Macrinus will be long dead. A pitiful memory. For now, however, he lives. Why do I write about this? A few days ago I challenged him to a duel. To the death. He had been drooling over my Lucienne and I could not bear it. He proved to be a better swordsman than I. But that is not the worst. A lost finger is nothing compared to lost honor. Maximus defeated me, yet instead of killing me, he spared my life. Never shall I forget the faces of the men who turned their eyes from me then.<br>I know I shall never know peace until I have dealt with him.<br><br>[a dozen or so blank pages]<br><br>I have found the journal which I was given by my father several years ago. During the time since I last held it, much has occurred in my life. I have fled Toussaint and sought my fortune in various places. With varied success. The worst, however, is that my hand has yet to grasp Maximus’ throat. I know it is only a matter of time.<br><br>I have decided to return to that hound-botched duchy. We have pitched camp on Mont Crane. I’ve carefully selected a band of men who will not flee from any task, any foe. The Toussaint which once forced me to run will now repay me in full. The highest price, however, shall be paid by Maximus Nonius Macrinus. When I get my hands on him, he will dream of one thing: death.<br>I’ve got the harlotsbrood! He’s lording it up at the Casteldaccia estate. He was given it by that sodden tart Anarietta – seems Duke Raymund’s been dead for a few years. Tomorrow my lads will pay him a visit. I shan’t go with them, however. The very thought of having to see his maggoty face again makes me ill. Farewell, Maximus, I have signed your death warrant.<br><br>I’m delighted. Maximus and all his family now rot. Their stench is a delight to stray mutts. Whenever I close my eyes, I see them perish. See them scream, moan and grovel. That makes my dinger stand firmer than even the curviest harlot could. I am at last satisfied.<br>

   1206851|a96121e5||The lads took me in, let me join the band. Must say, not really sure my jib’s the right cut for this racket. Never been a jelly-kneed milksop, mind, but one look at this lot and I near soiled my hose. Why, just the other day they picked up this chap in the woods who was out gathering mushrooms, all bright eyes and innocence. After an hour of our lads having their “fun” with the fellow, he was begging to be sent to his makers. Soon as he said as much, Fourfingers pointed his remaining digits straight at me. I wasn’t surprised -- being new and all, it was only natural I had to prove my chops – but nor was I exactly eager. But what could I do? Hold my nose and slit the boy’s throat, that’s what.<br><br>Ugh, I can still feel the sickly warmth of his blood on my hands, no matter how much emulsion I use. Don’t get me wrong, I’d killed before – but always in self-defense, or at least in circumstances which a generous mind or a shrewd barrister could cast in that mold. But no barrister will do me any good if the lads find out my stomach curdled when I did the deed. Then it’s out of the club with me, and that’s the best case scenario, if Filibert’s in a lenient mood. Otherwise… why, I don’t even want to think about it.

   1206855|3e45d4a6||Profits and Losses for the Month of Blathe<br><br>Day Three<br>Flying reptilians nest in the hills of the Champs-Désolés. They’ve taken to eating our men. Most recently they snatched up Gilbert, plucked him right off the wall. Gilbert was usually quite alert, but every man drops his guard a bit when emptying his water. Filibert’s furious. The cost of schooling a fresh-faced recruit into a functional member of our group is not inconsiderable. To have that cost turned into monster droppings – that’s regrettable waste.<br>Day Seven<br>We ambushed a caravan of merchants trekking from eastern Toussaint. They had no guards and put up no resistance, yet still we made virtually no profit – the shoddy rags they carried could only interest bare-bummed Skellige wildmen, and none of our group plans to voyage in that direction. Filibert grew furious yet again and killed one of the merchants, a man named Lumierex. The rest set off back east.<br>Day Eleven<br>Our scouts tracked down three men sneaking through the woods. They were all dressed as beggars and claimed to be such. We weren’t fooled. After a bit of rough play, they were revealed to be jewelers carrying gold from the mines of Maecht. Unrefined ore only, but of promising grade. Filibert ordered the jewelers killed. He hates liars with a passion.<br>Day Seventeen<br>An expedition from the Imperial Academy at Castel Graupian’s pitched tent on the other side of the Sansretour. Scholars are not known to suffer from excess wealth, yet these have capacious tents and ample amounts of alcohol. Thus their fate was sealed. Filibert sent a few men their way.<br>Day Twenty-Three<br>It’s been almost two weeks since anything of interest came along the high road. Meanwhile, knights errant have caught more of our lads. Two died, one was merely wounded and escaped. We lost equipment worth a great many crowns. Filibert ordered the wounded man flogged for carelessness. His weary body couldn’t take it and he died.<br>Day Twenty-Four<br>Our luck has turned. We caught a vintner’s caravan returning from the South. They had sold their goods and were carrying a great deal of coin. Preliminary calculations estimate takings of around four hundred crowns for each of us. Filibert has yet to decide if we will divide it equally.<br>Day Twenty-Eight<br>The unit sent to Basane Farm never returned with supplies. The vittles situation is tight. Man cannot live on alcohol alone, nor has anyone yet found a way to eat gold. We must plunder a few villages.<br>Day Thirty<br>I shall now perform a final accounting of the month of Blathe. We are in the black – and how. It seems we shall stay in this area another month.

   1205767|0ecfc544||Ding my dong, today we drink to the last drop – or till we drop! Fourfingers had us pitch camp near Delenfer Pass, and to keep from going daffy with boredom we set out on a little reconnaissance mission and happened across a merchant caravan. Sadly, we got a bit carried away – instead of gagging and hog-tying them, the lads sharpened some stakes and stuck the fat feckers on them. That was terribly exhausting work, but we had good fun doing it, and no cleft kisser can take that away. There was one skinny snipe amongst them, but we left him for later. What matters is, their wagons were packed full of quality wine just begging to be guzzled!<br><br>Naturally we established watches, so not everyone would get shloshed at once, as is only common sense.

No tart-twiddling idea what he liked about smacking at wood, but bumbotch him anyways. Geezer’s been pushing daisies for ages now. And if he were alive, I’d write him a letter like this: Papa, I like my work. A whole lot. And thanks for teaching me to read and write, because now I can let you know I give absolutely zero fecks about your advice.

Luq turned out to be a picky gentleman. The chef de cuisine served us veal cutlets in garlic sauce and Gessenese bean soup. Luq, however, asked for pancakes and red wine, making excuses about an inborn distaste for garlic. He also didn’t touch the silver cutlery, explaining something about an allergy and making use of his own wooden set instead. Despite these oddities, he made for quite interesting company and we chatted over a bottle (bottles, to be precise) of wine until late in the night. Something tells me there will soon be much talk of the Votty Gerek - Luq Veunèque duo in the world of speleologists!

   1208799|36c433b9||Dearest Father,<br><Br>It’s done. I’ve been knighted. Your efforts have not gone in vain. I’ve fulfilled our shared dream. Can you believe it? Your only son, a knight! Thank you for all those years of hard work and sacrifice. I know you refused yourself much to be able to afford to buy me a horse and armor. I know you worked very hard to allow me to live in Beauclair. That is why I dedicate my first quest to you, father. I shall exterminate some parasites prowling our main roads. Slaying a dragon it is not, but I am excited all the same.<br><br>Your Loving Son,<br><br>Michaël Subercaseaux

   1214224|cba8e67a||I’ve decided! I shall ask her tomorrow. A man only lives once!<br>We agreed to meet at our usual place at noon. Clarissa has asked for a half-day off, and I’ll sneak away from the chancellery. That old fogey of a supervisor will never notice I’m missing. And even if he did, so what! I’m young, I’ll find other work.<br>Although… if Clarissa found out I’d lost my job, she might not agree… I’d have proposed to her ages ago, were I not aware how much she fears a life of poverty. She’s never said as much, but I can see it worries her.<br>But what are we waiting for? Together we shall live more economically than apart, and finally we shall not have constantly to scheme up ways to meet here!<br>I wanted to invite her to dine at the best eatery in all of Beauclair… So many times I have imagined what it would be like. Waiters decked out in golden livery would bring us foie gras and sorbets. Clarissa would sit on a satin cushion, a raven-black crown of hair on her head and looking beautiful, the most beautiful woman in all the room.  Then, I would pull out a diamond ring.<br>But the truth is I shall never be able to afford all that, not even if Clarissa were to insist a ring of simple silver would be enough for her and we’d be better of spending that coin to buy a house in Hauteville, where we could open up a shop and she could sell hats.<br>Thus I shall propose to her tomorrow, in the abandoned wine cave which serves as our meeting place, our cozy sanctuary where we have spent so many pleasant hours together. She never complained that our only romantic moments have been spent surrounded by cobwebs and old barrels of wine. But tomorrow marks the end of all that! Once we are wed, I will carry her across my threshold. It will be tight quarters, but there will be room enough for a bed. And there will be no cobwebs.<br>I’ve only a simple copper ring for her, with a red glass jewel of the cheapest sort. But I promise in a year’s time I will exchange it for a silver one, with an amethyst, or maybe even a ruby!<br>O, Clarissa! Tomorrow cannot come soon enough!<br>I think I shall not be able to fall asleep tonight.
   1195084|2c2c0e2b||Antoine "Starling" Straggen’s notes
   1195085|c1fe12c1||<br><br>Taking the Silver Salamander Inn did a lot to relieve the tense atmosphere. Things had already relaxed a bit in the swamps, because a good number of our men went off on assignment, but our hanse’s so bum-hugging huge the ruins of Palace Arthach still look like a bleeding bazaar. A man can’t even empty his bowels in privacy. To top it all, my bones ache to high heavens from this humidity and even wenches can’t warm me up properly. Need to look around for something, and fast, before the good mood from the last raid fades completely and folk get ornery. This time, we need to hit something big.<br><br>Thinking more and more about that vineyard to the south, Coronata. It’d do perfectly. Worth sending some scouts, maybe start planning a big job.<br><br>Ah, and I need to straighten out something with the lads. Ever other one of them’s hit upon the idea of scribbling down memoirs. Regular bloody bunch of literati. Should take to practicing swordplay or hunting, instead of becoming diarists. I keep a log, that’s enough for the whole lot of us. I’ll whip one or two of the harlotsbroods, wipe my derrière with their diaries and maybe the rest will get down to some honest banditry.

   1208420|8276e255||[Journal kept chaotically, dates missing, ink blots abound]<br><br>What on earth got into me?! Humming one of Master Dandelion’s ballads in front of Her Illustrious Grace?! Ugh, to fall into disfavor in such a foolish way… I, a young, ambitious politician with brilliant career prospects at the ducal court, now find myself exiled due to my own stupidity. I must find a way to plead the duchess’ forgiveness…<br><br>They say the emperor has offered the duquessa a very strange gift: a shaelmaar! The knights are to face off against it during the tourney. Now, were I to make a similar offering to Her Illustrious Grace...<br><br>Inconceivable! The gods have smiled on me! I ran into a witcher in Belhaven willing to help me catch a young shaelmaar. Naturally he demanded a fortune for his services, but I am ready to do anything to get myself out of the duchess’ black books. The witcher collected a down payment and set off for the Amell Mountains...<br><br>I’ve got it! Success! With an offering for Her Grace worthy of an emperor, I can at last return to the duchy and seek forgiveness! Now I need only find a way to transport the shaelmaar to Beauclair...<br><br>I gathered my entire retinue and together we embarked on the good ship Suzanne. With the current in our favor, we should be in the capital in a mere three days!<br><br>I feel like the hero of some elven tragedy. Just when it seems all is going perfectly, catastrophes fall from the sky and pummel me to the ground… The shaelmaar chewed through the deck, sank the ship and dug its way into the river bottom. I begged the captain to help me capture the monster in exchange for the rest of my fortune. As the witcher instructed, I will light incense made of rue and direct the smoke at the monster, which should calm it. The sailors can then capture it in their nets.<br><br>I am finished. The rue incense did not work. The shaelmaar flew into a rage and killed nearly everyone. True, the captain managed to escape, but I could see he was badly wounded, so I doubt he managed to swim out of that cavern. Now I sit here alone, listening to the shaelmaar devour the remains of the murdered sailors.<br><br>You! The person who has found my journal, whoever you may be! Take the rest of my fortune – for what good is a chest of jewels to a pile of moldy bones? But in exchange, please, drink to my health, to my sad fate, to the hero of a true elven tragedy.

   1207251|d2fe1dc6||21st Day of Service<br>So diddling bored. There’s really sod all to do here. A quick morning round’s enough to water all the plants. Flower bed in front of the embassy doesn’t demand much care, either. And so it goes, day after day. Maybe tonight I’ll take a jaunt to San Sebastian. Play a hand of gwent.<br><br>22nd Day of Service<br>Bloede gwent. Lost a whole month’s wages. Next month’s, too. Racked up debts with that Graybill Pellegrin. Heard he doesn’t let such things slide. Got to scrounge up a few florens somehow, or this might end badly for me.<br><br>24th Day of Service<br>Overheard the ambassador give instructions to his secretary. In the coming days, they’ll send a transport carrying wine bought for the imperial court, along with some “unused operational wherewithal.” My guess – they mean a sack stuffed with florens! Information like that could be worth a fortune to a lad from the right part of town…<br><br>27th Day of Service<br>Graybill Pellegrin slaughtered the caravan’s guards, snatched all its cargo. Had the gall to deliver a pouch of coin to me at the embassy. Said it was my share. I spit on his coin, but I’m afraid I’ll need it, soon enough… I hid what he gave me in a safe place. Ever since Old Ralph died, no one buys wooden planters anymore, so his workshop’s the perfect hiding spot.<br><br>29th Day of Service<br>Graybill told me to keep my ears open at the embassy, find out when they’ll have another caravan to grab. As if as an afterthought, he added the guard commander would be quite shocked to learn about my role in the previous hijacking… I stole the next convoy’s route from the secretary’s office. It’s the price I must pay for my idiot idea of going in cahoots with Graybill Pellegrin.<br><br>31st Day of Service<br>The transport’s set off. This time it’s escorted by Arnold aep Bluhm – commander of the embassy guard. Graybill’s men don’t know they’re in for - a fight against elite soldiers. When he finds out… Then it’s time to get out of here. Coin I set aside should be enough to start afresh, somewhere far, far away. Maecht seems like a good direction.

If you make mush here, you might as well hang up your apron, for you’re no chef. Once the turkey’s taken on the bouquet’s fragrance, throw it in a pan with the heated olive oil. Pour in the wine – once it’s boiled off, toss in the pasta. Let it fry for a bit. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half and add them to the noodles. Give it all a good peppering. Add two tablespoons of ricotta – mix thoroughly. Plate the dish and decorate with the arugula.

   1208423|be2b643f||My beloved Seraphine has a lover. I’m not going to rend my garments, curse the gods or swear vengeance. My Seraphine brims with so much life energy, it was inevitable some would spill over into other canals. It is now up to me to cut off those spillways, vanquish my rival and hope the walls I erect will prove sufficient to satisfy her vitality and give us a life of mutual exuberance… I have already forgiven her. Now I need but meet her beau and remove him from our life. <br><br>Yesterday I followed Seraphine. They hold their trysts at the Olive Grove – how romantic. When they met... Birds flew over the grove. A whole flock… Twittering and chirping. As if celebrating the lovers’ joy… and as if mocking me cruelly…  how symbolic.<br><br>I can see this romance drain my darling wife. Since she began seeing this… her lover, she has become anemic, eternally pale. She wanders the house at night aimlessly, blindly. She used to be so lively, so radiant, yet now she is listless, apathetic, resigned. I must gather my courage and end their relationship as soon as possible.<br><br>I, Christophe Dugarry, despise violence. I shall resolve the matter of my wife’s lover pragmatically. I have prepared a full sack of Nilfgaardian florens, one so heavy I can barely lift it. I shall wait for my Seraphine to return from the grove to our residence and then I shall catch him… and make him an offer he cannot refuse. Saint Lebioda, give me strength!

   1213149|c1d58d7c||My Darling Girl,<br>I cannot wait until we meet again. My nights are restless, my head full of thoughts of you and only you. If someone had told me but a few months prior such a virile and burning passion would bind me to another woman, I would have laughed in their face. But now… Now my only desire is to be close to you.<br><br>Christophe is beginning to suspect something, yet I have hope my reassurances will quell his worries. I would not like to hurt him, if possible. He is a good man, warm-hearted and honest, but the fire which once burned between us has extinguished. I know you understand this and am delighted I can be honest with you.<br><br>Till we can meet again (it cannot be too soon!), please, Xymena, take care.<br>Yours Lovingly, Devotedly, Undyingly,<br>- Seraphine

Since that last caravan we robbed, the one carrying a transport of fatback for workers at the quarry – we’ve had nothing, zero, zip! Luckily we ate our fill after that, gained a slight paunch to hold us through hard times… But if those times last much longer, we’ll have eaten more supplies here than we’ve looted! And everybody thinks being a bandit’s nothing but wine, wenches and merry-making! Should’ve listened to mama and finished school, or at least started it… <br><br>Tomorrow we head back to Mont Crane.

   1201065|2f22dc59||Dear Sir,<br><br>I trust this letter finds you in good health. As per our earlier correspondence, I would like to commission from you a geological survey to use in determining in which location we shall find the most fitting soil for expanding our vineyard’s acreage. I suspect my messenger has already given you your retainer. As a final matter, I’d like to warn you against putting too much faith in the rumors which various beggars and vagrants have been spreading through our community in the last weeks – we in this area do not have any problems with giant centipedes or monsters of any sort, and you may begin your work at once with no need to fear.<br><br>I wish you success and eagerly await the results of your survey.<br>Count Vladimir Crespi
   1206164|8b4f56d1||List bearing Belgaard's seal
   1206165|58ec41db||Dear Gabriel,<br>As you are surely aware, in the wake of the count’s death, all responsibility for the care and management of Belgaard has fallen on me. In that capacity I turn to you for help, for you are both the best rhabdomancer in all the duchy and also a dear friend, so I pray you will not refuse me your services. Curious how your services might be needed by me in managing my vineyard? I shall soon tell you.<br><br>Before his death, Count Crespi ordered an extraordinary valuable batch of seedlings and if we do not plant them in the very near future, they shall all wither and perish. Sadly, the count left no record of where in the estate we are to prepare the ground for these seedlings. The geologist whom the count had summoned to show us the most fitting soil collected his (hefty) retainer, then disappeared. I would not be surprised to learn he was a common cheat. But let us get to the heart of the matter. I wish to ask you to use your rhabdomancical talents to locate where we should plant these valuable vines. I dare trust you shall take pity on an old friend and see to the task right away. Belgaard’s coffers are, it is true, empty, but I think I shall find a way to compensate you for your troubles.<br><br>Your Friend, Thierry Pires,<br><br>P.S. Be careful, for ever since Count Crespi’s death, this area has not been as safe as it once was.

   1168725|00000000||While travelling in Toussaint, Geralt learned of the existence of a new deck. It was inspired by the Skellige Isles and their inhabitants. Since the new Skellige faction had just made its debut, Geralt decided to seize the moment and gather all the cards belonging to it before other collectors could get their paws on them.<br>
   1168726|00000000||Geralt did what he had set out to do. After many a victorious hand of gwent, he finally had all the cards from the Skellige deck. Though it cost him a great deal of effort, it was all worth it, for the new cards were truly beautiful sights to behold.
   1214201|00000000||Despite his strong desire to obtain all the Skellige cards, Geralt had to divert his attention from his gwent hobby (a most distinguished and demanding one, true, but a hobby nonetheless!) so he could fight off the vampires attacking Beauclair.
   1214202|00000000||Once he had staved off the threat of the vampire horde, Geralt joyfully returned to completing his collection.

   1208714|00000000||<i>Looks like a flower to me. A hideous, disgusting flower.</i> <br>– Blasco Tennerbe, last words<br><br>Archespores look like gigantic, aesthetically unpleasing flowers with some of the traits of exceptionally cruel and bloodthirsty sundews. They are, however, far more dangerous than even the most colossal sundew. Their peculiar appearance makes them practically impossible to discern amidst other plants. By the time one draws close enough to realize what they are, it is often too late to flee.<br><br>According to popular belief, archespores are cursed plants grown in soil fertilized by the blood of the dying. They are most often found in places which in the past saw pogroms, bloody rituals or cruel murders. Four types of archespore have been catalogued to date, differing from one another in terms of coloring: brown (the least dangerous), green and purple (the most dangerous). The final variant, said to have been cultivated by mages from Ban Ard, is the yellow archespore, whose strength is similar to that of its green-colored cousins.<br><br>
   1208715|00000000||Regardless of color, all archespores fight using similar methods: attacking with powerful, jaw-like leaves. If their victim is out of reach, they can also spray caustic acid which, if it makes any contact whatsoever with the skin, can provoke a reaction similar to that caused by severe poisoning.<br><br>Like other plants, all archespores are extremely vulnerable to fire, which is one of the most effective methods of fighting them. Silver also works well, as does any sort of shock wave. Archespores do not like strong vibrations, which cause them to flee underground at once. Due to the nature of their origins, oil damaging to cursed beings can also be useful against them.

    312802|05e75e62||Harpy
   1102052|00000000||One day Geralt got an unusual proposition. A portrait artist, inspired and delighted by the witcher's singular appearance, asked if he would pose for a painting. Largely open to the varied experiences life offers, the witcher agreed to model for the painter. Though he later claimed he was driven primarily by a desire to support the arts (an impulse laudable in and of itself!), I suspect plain old vanity might also have come into play.<br>The witcher and the artist set off together for the countryside, where the beautiful landscape was to serve as the backdrop for the portrait.<br>
   1102053|00000000||Once they arrived at their destination, it turned out that some picnickers had occupied the vista the artist had chosen. To make matters worse, the artist's painting tools had disappeared, and the witcher had to find them.<br>In the end he could finally get down to posing and was pained to learn that a portrait takes much longer to produce than he had supposed. He did not manage to grow thoroughly bored, however, thanks to a griffin that swooped in unannounced. Geralt had to defeat the beast to save both the painter and his emerging work. He received payment for posing and learned he would be able to view the finished portrait the next day in the main town square.<br>
   1102054|00000000||Geralt finally saw the work that generated quite a lot of interest from the inhabitants of Beauclair. As it turned out, in the portrait the painter had rendered the witcher in the nude. Though explicit, the representation was flattering. To this day I remember the sheepish grin on Geralt's face as he related the tale to yours truly!<br>
   1206737|00000000||Geralt decided he would pose for the painter no more, concluding that other potential employers surely needed a witcher more. Perhaps he was right to decide so, as, let us be candid, the witcher made for an excruciatingly poor model.<br>.
   1206738|00000000||Once they arrived at their destination, it turned out that some picnickers had occupied the vista the artist had chosen. To make matters worse, the artist's painting tools had disappeared, and the witcher had to find them.<br>In the end he could finally get down to posing and was pained to learn that a portrait takes much longer to produce than he had supposed. He did not manage to grow thoroughly bored, however, thanks to a griffin that swooped in unannounced. Geralt decided not to fight the beast, leaving the painter to his own devices.<br>
   1100864|00000000||Meet the painter around noon by the western gate of the palace.
   1100865|00000000||Follow the painter.
   1100866|00000000||Kill the griffin.
   1100867|00000000||Wait one day to see your painting.
   1100868|00000000||Go see your painting at the market.

   1185775|00000000||True, you are not the most endearing of men.
   1185793|00000000||At any rate, I see the effort you put forth. And I appreciate it.

   1181376|00000000||Not at all surprised. Expected she'd want to oversee this personally…
   1181378|00000000||The master's eye fattens the calf. You're beginning to understand that, I see…
   1181370|00000000||Might've known she'd come…
   1181369|00000000||She's here?
   1181372|00000000||Wait… she here?
   1181374|00000000||I hope you did not think I would leave this to you alone? Especially when every hour could prove essential.
   1181380|00000000||This prisoner of yours, bring him to me. We must ask him some questions…
   1185802|00000000||Captain, do the honors.
   1185804|00000000||Who sent you?
   1186890|00000000||His name is dog. They say he ploughed your mother.
   1185841|00000000||Once again - who sent you?
   1181391|00000000||Your nan's lover! They call him…
   1181399|00000000||Wait… if he doesn't wish to speak, he needn't. I can think of several other ways he can be helpful.
   1181401|00000000||I'm certain the witcher will need bait to lure the Beast of Beauclair.
   1185843|00000000||Wha… what?
   1181537|00000000||Usually only take measures like that as a last resort, but in this case… think I can make an exception.
   1181539|00000000||Do as you deem fit. He is all yours.
   1181406|00000000||Only use this kind of bait as a last resort.
   1181405|00000000||Great idea.
   1181533|00000000||Sure can, fresh out.
   1181535|00000000||In that case, he is all yours.
   1187535|00000000||Captain, have your men find me a strong rope. Kind that won't snap when we hang this fellow from a tree…
   1187537|00000000||R-rope?
   1181545|00000000||Live bait - great for monsters. Provided they catch the scent of its blood. But I'll see to that.
   1181548|00000000||What…?! No! Crikey, no! Don't let him….!
   1181553|00000000||Stop screaming, save your strength. Got a long night ahead of you.
   1181555|00000000||No! Don't let him…! I'll talk!
   1163780|00000000||Who hired you?
   1163940|00000000||Who hired you?
   1163942|00000000||He… he'll kill me.
   1181565|00000000||Oughta be worried about me right now. Who is he?
   1163944|00000000||Go on, man. Spit it out.
   1163947|00000000||The Cintrian - that is what they call him. I've never seen him. But I know he mustered the men for this caper.
   1172214|00000000||That's what they said. That we were working for the Cintrian.
   1181567|00000000||I don't know anything else, I swear it.
   1163949|00000000||Take him away, throw him in the dungeon. He shall await trial there.
   1166137|00000000||Captain, we ride to town. Gather your men and seek out this Cintrian. Someone else must have seen him, must know of him.
   1172220|00000000||Yes, Your Grace! I'll report to the palace as soon as I learn anything.
   1172222|00000000||I shan't return to the palace, our mission has not yet ended. The witcher and I will await you at the guard post near the port.
   1189034|00000000||I'll join you. We'll meet there.
   1189036|00000000||We shall await your arrival.
   1189030|00000000||Join you there.
   1189029|00000000||Let's go.
   1189032|00000000||Let's go to town.

   1115772|00000000||Give me peace, please! What makes you insist on me as your victim?! Why choose me to torment?!
   1155718|00000000||Begone, foul spirit!
   1155736|00000000||What do you want of me, spirit?
   1155738|00000000||I cannot shut my eyes, for fear the nightmare comes again.
   1155740|00000000||What must I do to banish you, to rid myself of this torment?!
   1155742|00000000||I'm dead on my feet, tired as the grave.

   1161838|00000000||True, he won fair and square.
   1161840|00000000||We were unlucky, that's all.

   1189311|00000000||My man's up to something. All our spoons went missing last. But when I ask what he's done with them, he insists he knows nothing…
   1194845|00000000||He could be telling the truth. You're not the first to have spoons disappear.
   1194847|00000000||But… why would someone take them? Were they silver, that would be one thing… but I've a tin setting, it's not worth a copper…
   1194849|00000000||They say some monster's stealing spoons. It comes by night, pulls open the drawers… But gods only know if that's true.

   1201767|00000000||<i>Some peasants once offered me a king’s ransom to slay a slyzard. A damned hefty purse, chock full o’ gold… But I turned ‘em down. Coin’s no good if you’re dead. And a slyzard, that’s no fuckin’ forktail.</i><br> – Zator, one of the Crinfrid Reavers<br><br>Slyzards are often mistaken for wyverns or forktails. Yet make no mistake: slyzards are nasty, terribly dangerous beasts, and confusing them for wyverns will end very badly for the confuser. While a wyvern can tear apart and devour an untrained man in seconds, only a slyzard can first bake him to a crisp with a waft of fiery breath.<br>
   1208698|00000000||Slyzards are keenly aggressive and attack from both ground and air. Their goal during a fight is to get close enough to their foe to injure it with a breath of fire or knock it down with a sonic blast. Like wyverns, slyzards also attack with venom-spiked tails.<br><br>Slyzards like to disengage mid-fight to fly into the air and plummet down at high speed while spewing out balls of fire.<br><br>Right before these igneous missiles emerge, you can observe a fiery ball forming in the monster’s maw. While airborne, a slyzard can also attack with its claws and teeth.<br><br>It is worthwhile to employ the Aard and Igni Signs to force slyzards to the ground. They are not, however, vulnerable to burning. Before tackling one of them, be sure to coat your blade in draconid oil.

   1189364|00000000||Lammert, my friend… It's common knowledge Bombino Nero yields the best sweet red.
   1193332|00000000||Bombino?! You yourself are bombinoed if you think that true! Our Camina is the sweetest grape in Beauclair, as anyone can tell you!

   1106049|00000000||Most, yeah.
   1106056|00000000||Good chunk of them, I'm afraid.
   1106058|00000000||Agh… I should have donned a priestess' robe.
   1105386|00000000||Afraid I've got bad news… Sir le Goff fell in combat.
   1105394|00000000||Oh… Just as I had feared! He was so terribly courageous, bold to the point of being rash! He'd have done anything for me!
   1106071|00000000||Gran always said true love must end in true tragedy… It seems she was right.
   1106088|00000000||Sorry for your loss… Farewell.
   1106076|00000000||I'm sorry. Farewell.
   1106075|00000000||So, about my reward…
   1106084|00000000||So… um… about my reward - didn't manage to save his life, true, but I did--
   1106086|00000000||Re-- reward?! I mourn the loss of the love of my life, yet you-- The gall! Take your gold! And choke on it!
   1106073|00000000||But what care have you for my heart's woes… Your reward, as I vowed. And advice should you ever find yourself a lady witcher - be truthful with her to save the world some grief.
   1106052|00000000||Not all. A few exceptions out there.
   1106054|00000000||Agh… Perhaps in your distant Rivia.
   1106048|00000000||Not all.
   1105396|00000000||Good news. Your betrothed--
   1105400|00000000||Is my betrothed no more.
   1106035|00000000||What?
   1106037|00000000||He was just here, just departed. Having made a new vow - this time to fetch me a striped horse from Zerrikania!
   1106039|00000000||Well… least he chose something he stands to accomplish on his own. Quite the trek, though…
   1106043|00000000||Precisely! I told him I require no more proof! Let us make haste to the temple! He began hemming and hawing, babbling about honor and whatnot…
   1106047|00000000||Grrr… Tell me, master witcher - are all men swine?
   1168617|00000000||Not sure that's such a great idea…
   1168634|00000000||Hm. Not sure these nuptials are a great idea…
   1168636|00000000||What?! I beg your pardon?!
   1168638|00000000||Young maser le Goff… Well, he wasn't exactly raring to get hitched. Seems to me you two should re--
   1168640|00000000||Well, I never! The nerve! Not another word! Take your coin and leave us be!
   1168619|00000000||Hm. Congratulations, I guess. Wish you happiness, both of you.
   1168621|00000000||And good fortune to you on your Path! Your reward, master! And godspeed!
   1168616|00000000||Congratulations.
   1167873|00000000||Got good news, mademoi--

   1193889|00000000||How are you farin'?
   1193891|00000000||What now?
   1193893|00000000||Mhm?
   1193895|00000000||Ho, there!
   1174760|00000000||Stand was somewhere in the port district. And the bootblack acted as if he knew Dettlaff.
   1174762|00000000||Hm. That would be even odder…
   1181885|00000000||Perhaps we should have a chat with the lad, though I would expect no breakthroughs.
   1181887|00000000||It's our only lead. I'll go talk to him. Coming with?
   1181889|00000000||I shall join you later, if it's no trouble. I don't yet feel strong enough to venture out.
   1181891|00000000||That's fair. Rest up. Be back as soon as I learn anything.
   1174758|00000000||Feel like I've seen the boy - the bootblack. Ran into him somewhere in the port district.
   1181868|00000000||And it seemed like he knew Dettlaff in the vision.
   1181863|00000000||There was something, showed up twice in the vision - a bootblack's stand. Dettlaff first met de la Croix there. Went back after the murder, actually…
   1181865|00000000||Peculiar…
   1181807|00000000||Vision began and ended with a bootblack.
   1193931|00000000||Saw the moment when Dettlaff and de la Croix first met.
   1182033|00000000||Saw a moment - de la Croix did something selfless, was kind to Dettlaff… Guess it could've been the start of their friendship…
   1182037|00000000||Why the uncertainty?
   1182039|00000000||Nothing extraordinary about it. Normal, everyday situation, really. Visions were supposed to issue from strong emotions.
   1182041|00000000||Clearly the situation provoked such emotions in Dettlaff. Keep in mind, he did later murder de la Croix.
   1182043|00000000||Killing someone who's grown dear to us, it's bound to elicit strong emotion. Vampires are no different in that regard.
   1182047|00000000||Did you see anything else?
   1181704|00000000||De la Croix… his death did not come easy.
   1181706|00000000||Seems Dettlaff had made friends with him. Still killed him and chopped up his corpse.
   1181792|00000000||Then he was overcome with fury, remorse. Cut off the hand that had committed the murder.
   1181806|00000000||Hm. Interesting. And entirely unlike the Dettlaff I know. See anything else?
   1174752|00000000||Awake at last. You writhed like a squirrel caught in a snare. I'd begun to fear they were death throes, that you'd… departed.
   1181677|00000000||Ehh… Sure wasn't pleasant… but it worked.
   1174754|00000000||What did you see?
   1174745|00000000||Resonance, it's ready.
   1181600|00000000||Are you certain you followed the formula? The proportions were exact, the brewing time precise?
   1181603|00000000||This is important, Geralt. The slightest deviation could cost even a witcher dearly.
   1181605|00000000||Relax. Got some experience brewing potions.
   1181607|00000000||Very well… In that case, let's begin.
   1181708|00000000||I finished your brew.
   1181709|00000000||Let's talk - what happened back there?
   1181716|00000000||Never expected it to be like that. You didn't tell me.
   1181745|00000000||We need not discuss it.
   1181747|00000000||But we do. 'Cause if I'd known you were going to subject yourself to torture--
   1181749|00000000||What would you have done?
   1181751|00000000||Found Dettlaff some other way.
   1181753|00000000||I did not wish you to use any other way. Did that occur to you?
   1181755|00000000||No, 'cause I thought no being would ever willingly subject itself to that kind of pain. You vampires aren't any different from us in that regard.
   1181757|00000000||I told you, the pain is my way of paying my debt - the enormous debt I owe Dettlaff. If I had to do it again… I would, in a heartbeat.
   1181719|00000000||Any better?
   1181721|00000000||Far from ideal and some time must pass before I fully recover, but yes, a bit better. Thank you.
   1191315|00000000||Need to hang on a little longer. Blood'll dry in a few hours. Scent won't bother you anymore.
   1191319|00000000||Get you out of here.
   1191322|00000000||The concoction…
   1191324|00000000||You can't finish it in this state. Tell me how, I'll help you.
   1191620|00000000||Excuse me.
   1191623|00000000||I shall only take a moment.
   1191625|00000000||You jumped the queue, sir.
   1191628|00000000||But Count, sir! You must understand… I've a… meeting… the council…
   1191630|00000000||Sir! You were next! Please, take a seat!
   1191633|00000000||This gentleman was here first. Step down, or you shall regret it.
   1191635|00000000||Ahhh… failed to realize he was your friend, Count.
   1191638|00000000||It was then I ordered him to give up his seat and step off the stand. If only you'd seen his face! We got him good, didn't we, Dettlaff?
   1191652|00000000||And then mother insisted we buy the mill! Hah, curious, eh?
   1211060|00000000||But at least I've a yarn to spin for friends and associates.
   1191655|00000000||Forgive me.
   1208978|00000000||What…?
   1191659|00000000||Aa! Aa! Aargh! Aaaarrrgghhh!
   1135496|00000000||Done. Deposit box 256 - last yin on the right.
   1177987|00000000||What the hell's this, Cianfanelli? Box is empty.
   1177991|00000000||Well…. errr… coin's got tae circulate, so when we learned ye were dead, master, we, uhh, circulated yers…
   1177993|00000000||Purchased stocks, bonds, invested in a few vineyards… Before we knew it, there was hee haw left in the box.
   1178003|00000000||Really oughta call it what it is. You robbed me, plain and simple.
   1178005|00000000||Nae, master witcher, never! I wouldnae dare…
   1178007|00000000||Oh, you'd dare. And now you'll answer for it. Open the gate.
   1178010|00000000||Master witcher! I'll pay it all back, every red copper! Swear it on mah nana's beard!
   1170742|00000000||Ye shan't regret this, I swear. I'll rustle it up, have it ready for ye in seven days.
   1170744|00000000||Mhm. See you then.
   1178015|00000000||Got a week. Not one day more.
   1140089|00000000||Got a week.
   1168482|00000000||Fooled me once. Not about to let you fool me again.
   1168484|00000000||Master Geralt, I beg ye, keep yer heid! We can work this out, I know we can.
   1169926|00000000||Rip that coin out of your throat if I have to.
   1179014|00000000||Guards! Heeeeelp!
   1140090|00000000||I'll rip that coin out of your throat if I have to.
   1191532|00000000||What's that you wanted?
   1187402|00000000||Whoa, sir! Watch it!
   1198691|00000000||I've this strange inkling that's a load of hooey.
   1198689|00000000||What's this?! You don't say!
   1187408|00000000||A whish, and a whack! And that was all she wrote for the Beast.
   1187410|00000000||Vampeers attacked the city?! Is that true?!
   1200445|00000000||Master Liam and Maid Matilda, why they'll have a tale to hold their kiddies rapt!
   1198899|00000000||I wish some hanse would cut up those bedwetters at Vermentino!
   1187406|00000000||If my lips don't stink of wine, my wife won't know they're mine!
   1187404|00000000||A man who dare not down some red is a man who's wife's like to thump his head!
   1187412|00000000||Leave me be! Please!
   1198697|00000000||That shaking at the Tufo vineyard? It was monsters that'd made their lair in the burrows underneath. But the witcher, a true specialist, he smoked them all out!
   1198695|00000000||At the Casteldaccia vineyard there's a wraith so frightening, no man dares go near! One look from the creature and the blood in your veins is like to freeze!
   1198693|00000000||In seeking out the witcher, our knights rode as far as the land they call Velen. Such famine rages there! Why, they bake bread out of acorns and have never so much as heard of wine!
   1187416|00000000||Hi, there, ho, there!
   1187414|00000000||My regards.
   1163536|58425001||"Unicorn"
   1185869|00000000||Professor's mutagens might work on me as they did on his son…? Well, time to find out.
   1185678|00000000||…
   1193578|00000000||Greetings.
   1193580|00000000||Salut!
   1193582|00000000||I'm listening, sirrah.
   1193584|00000000||Hm hm.
   1193586|00000000||Calm down!
   1193588|00000000||Are you mad?
   1193590|00000000||Spare me!
   1147708|00000000||I'm walking on water. Just like…
   1154093|00000000||Like who?
   1154095|00000000||Like a pond skater. Who were you thinking?
   1147710|00000000||No matter. I suppose you thought nothing else in life could surprise you, ehh? Wrong!
   1147722|00000000||Hey, happen to know how the hell I can walk on that water?
   1147724|00000000||Naturally, I know. Since time immemorial have I dwelt in solitude on this shore. And I can testify to the extraordinary nature of the lake.
   1147726|00000000||What's so extraordinary about it - I mean, besides the fact that you can walk on its surface?
   1147728|00000000||A sword most wondrous lies in its depths. I watch over it.
   1154183|00000000||The blade may be grasped solely by one who possesses the five chivalric virtues.
   1147730|00000000||Folk call me a lot of things, but virtuous - I dunno…
   1147732|00000000||Yet I do know. For I know who you are…
   1147734|00000000||You have proven yourself capable of great sympathy.
   1147736|00000000||You are a man of honor, as many can attest.
   1147738|00000000||Of humble means yourself, you show generosity to others.
   1147742|00000000||Your valor is the stuff of legends.
   1147740|00000000||To acquire the sword, you must first convince me you are worthy. The inscriptions on these stones describe the five virtues - valor, honor, wisdom, sympathy and generosity.
   1154467|00000000||During your time in Toussaint, you can prove these virtues dwell in your heart. In this world there are many in need - they will help you prove your chivalry.
   1147935|00000000||Reason guides your actions, as it does those of all who are wise.
   1147744|00000000||You have proven the five chivalric virtues dwell in your heart.
   1154469|00000000||Mean the sword's mine? I can dive in and take it?
   1147746|00000000||The sword deserves the hand of a master. You must prove your skills are worthy through combat atop the water's surface. Are you ready?
   1147819|00000000||Hey, hermit.
   1147821|00000000||Greetings. Ready to stand and fight for the wondrous blade?
   1147817|00000000||Gonna need some time.
   1147811|00000000||I'm not ready.
   1147810|00000000||I'm ready.
   1147813|00000000||Any time.
   1147815|00000000||Then draw your blade.
   1147842|00000000||To know more about the five chivalric virtues, you must read the inscriptions carved into the stones.
   1147807|00000000||Return once you've proven you possess the five virtues.

   1124001|002eadd8||Coco
   1162877|00000000||Out of my way, witcher.
   1162875|00000000||Shove your pickley up your nose.
   1162879|00000000||Tie your pickley in a bow!
   1162881|00000000||This will be over quick…
   1162883|00000000||Hey, smart bum!
   1194650|00000000||I'm sooooo hmmm…wet.
   1194657|00000000||Hmmm…
   1194659|00000000||Hey there, handsome!
   1194661|00000000||Give me strength…
   1194652|00000000||Meooooow?
   1194655|00000000||Ahh hahahahaha!
   1194663|00000000||Easy!
   1194665|00000000||Don't kill me!
   1100336|a686eaa2||Mystery Man
   1175648|00000000||I've herbs for all ailments!
   1175646|00000000||Good day!
   1198262|00000000||I heard about your heroism when the vampires attacked Beauclair…
   1175650|00000000||Mm, the aroma - lovely!
   1175652|00000000||Mint, nettle, horsetail! Nature's bounty!
   1175654|00000000||Ouch! Careful!
   1175656|00000000||Please don't hurt me!
   1198501|00000000||Witcher! Our salvadore! Come here!
   1202176|00000000||Greetings, witcher. Remember, you are in Beauclair. An orderly city.
   1202178|00000000||Welcome to the capital of Toussaint.
   1202180|00000000||You crossed the wrong man!
   1202182|00000000||This shall be your final fight.
   1202184|00000000||I will show you your place, scum, or my name is not Damien de la Tour!
   1124864|00000000||Inconceivable! An unprecedented contest! Though walloped in the battle of wits, the witcher still managed to beat Mancomb! Literally! We've never seen this before!
   1124860|00000000||You've one opponent left, but what a foe he is - Colossus. The fastest fighter around. Find him in Saint Sebastian, look for the largest courtyard in the district. Beat him and you may face the Maestro.
   1124856|00000000||Two more champions to defeat before you can challenge the Maestro. Still Waters is to be found in Hauteville, not far from Mountebank Alley. While Colossus fights in the largest courtyard in Saint Sebastian.
   1124858|00000000||You've but one foe left before you can challenge the Maestro. The mysterious knight, Still Waters, famed throughout the duchy, his true face and name unknown. You'll find him in Hauteville, near Mountebank Alley.
   1124862|00000000||Thus you've gained the right to challenge the Maestro. Look for him at the docks. And congratulations - I'm impressed.
   1171615|00000000||Thanks.
   1199618|00000000||Though a man of few words and even fewer jests, the witcher is ever a fighter! Geralt has vanquished Mancomb!
   1124866|00000000||The witcher wins! Beating Mancomb at his own game!
   1191662|00000000||You out-tongued me… But only because I'm under the weather today. I'd have lashed you raw, otherwise.
   1191664|00000000||Right. Sure.
   1124868|00000000||The witcher has lost. Refusing in a battle of wits to engage, he thoroughly Master Mancomb enraged. Who has no patience for purse-lipped pugilists stripped of panache.
   1124870|00000000||The witcher tastes defeat, while Mancomb proves victorious at his own game! Perhaps next time, monster slayer.
   1178423|00000000||None's ever out-bantered me. I'm a good… talker… fellow. And that's that.
   1178425|00000000||You throw hard punches… but your taunts need attention.
   1178429|00000000||Mancomb tosses taunts sharp as daggers!
    170812|f3248005||Water Hag
   1155466|00000000||Hm… might need you to craft something for me…
   1155461|00000000||Need you to craft something for me.
   1178469|00000000||Seems the hanse was prepared for a long siege…
   1178471|00000000||Oh, yes. The rats had woven quite the nest. Some knights errant took swipes at them, but cracked their claws on those… ruins.
   1178473|00000000||Not surprised. Von Wittan turned that rubble into a fortress. With a ballista in the lower courtyard, no less.
   1178475|00000000||Well, that machine was most like there to fight off the winged lizards. A whole host live in these hills.
   1178477|00000000||Alert eye on the sky at all times, witcher.
   1178439|00000000||Pretty well armed, those bandits…
   1155468|00000000||Thanks. Farewell.
   1178441|00000000||Good luck on your Path!
   1155462|00000000||Take care.
   1155460|00000000||Show me what you got.
   1155464|00000000||Your goods - mind if I have a glance?
   1178443|00000000||Most honored witcher! The slaughter of Filibert Fourfingers von Wittan - quite the feat. You've my respect and gratitude, for ever and always!
   1178445|00000000||He'd squatted in those ruins for months, him and that hanse of his. Whoever they captured alive lived to regret not having been cleaved in battle.
   1178447|00000000||Managed to assemble a pretty good bunch of men…
   1178449|00000000||Refuse from all the world. Bandits, degenerates. Drawn like flies to doo-doo.
   1178451|00000000||It is good you felled them to a man. You've my gratitude, and good prices for all time here!
   1155459|00000000||Witcher! Von Wittan's bane!
   1198875|00000000||Master witcher! Might I have a moment, please?
   1191564|00000000||What can I say? I don't know. I just don't know.
   1191566|00000000||Hello.
   1191568|00000000||I wish you luck. You'll need it.
   1191560|00000000||There's naught to be done about them…
   1191570|00000000||Boors, boors everywhere.
   1191562|00000000||Lebioda wept…
   1191572|00000000||Aaaaaah!
   1188950|00000000||And? Have you ordered a new coat for the Wine Festival?
   1195067|00000000||Yes! You ought to see it! Beautifully tailored orange silk trimmed with mink…
   1195077|00000000||Ooh, that won't do…
   1195079|00000000||It won't do? Why not…?
   1195081|00000000||Her Grace just announced she will don a crimson gown. And orange and crimson blend about as well as oil and water. Oh, she's likely to be cross, very cross…
   1208891|7516a181||Servant
   1193705|00000000||Where to, witcher? We've a mission to complete.
   1193707|00000000||We must waste no more time. To the vineyard, at once.
   1199106|00000000||You call that escorting Her Illustrious Highness?! What were you thinking?!
   1199108|00000000||Captain, this is not the time for such complaints. As for you, witcher - next time, keep close.
   1181005|00000000||Here for an inspection.
   1181011|00000000||This is an inspection. We've got questions. You'll answer them.
   1181013|00000000||And who are you, sir, to speak to me this way?
   1161924|00000000||Had any wine stolen?
   1171058|00000000||Some of this wine might've been stolen. Just a suspicion we have, but… any burglaries lately?
   1171060|00000000||Burglaries…? Not to my knowledge. And a few days past I took stock of the inventory - all was accounted for.
   1171062|00000000||The barrels lie safely in the cellar, I assure you.
   1171848|00000000||We'll not get anywhere asking questions, I see… It's a waste of time.
   1171850|00000000||Your Grace? How am I to understand this?
   1171852|00000000||Master Fabricio, we have proof someone's gained access to Sangreal, someone who should not have. Which means one of two things.
   1171854|00000000||Either you lie to our face or you are an idiot who has had wine stolen from under his nose and not even realized it. In either case, you shall answer for it.
   1171856|00000000||B… But…
   1171858|00000000||Silence! And listen! I shall inspect the barrels in person, thus giving you time to reflect. When I return, I expect to hear answers.
   1192246|00000000||Remind me, where is the Sangreal stored?
   1192248|00000000||In… in the main cellar, around the corner… I'll show you…
   1171860|00000000||I shall find it. Give me the key to the cellar and wait here.
   1196839|00000000||Of… of course, Your Grace. Here it is.
   1192250|00000000||Come, witcher.
   1171839|00000000||Who hauls the barrels to the palace?
   1171841|00000000||We've our own garrison. Guards who have served here for years and would answer with their heads for the wine.
   1161469|00000000||How's the wine transported?
   1161468|00000000||Who's got access to the wine?
   1171018|00000000||The Sangreal - how many vineyard workers have access to it?
   1171020|00000000||One might say only I do.
   1171022|00000000||Not like you make the wine all alone. At least a dozen others work here.
   1171024|00000000||I see you've little notion how wine is made. Grapes travel a long road before they become Sangreal.
   1198986|00000000||The workers assist me only to the stage of fermentation. I see to the maceration personally and let no one near the vat.
   1198988|00000000||Workers, again, assist me during barreling, but then I seal the aging barrels myself. Each and every one.
   1198990|00000000||The wine lies in the cellar, gains character. Once this process is complete, it becomes Sangreal. And as it happens, only I have the key to the cellar in question.
   1181021|00000000||This is Geralt of Rivia, a witcher. He has come to Toussaint on my personal invitation.
   1181024|00000000||Which is to say…?
   1181026|00000000||Which is to say I expect you to treat him with the utmost respect.
   1181028|00000000||Of… of course, Your Grace.
   1181030|00000000||Did you hear that, witcher? Fabricio will be delighted to answer your every question.
   1181032|00000000||Wanna talk about Sangreal.
   1181034|00000000||I am at your service.
   1181007|00000000||Came to see you. Got some questions.
   1181009|00000000||In this land, it is seen as polite to introduce oneself before asking any questions.
   1181004|00000000||Wanna talk to you.
   1171006|00000000||Captain de la Tour! We did not expect any visitors from the palace. How are affairs at court?
   1180810|00000000||Doubtless you've heard of the Beast of Beauclair. Well, we've our hands full.
   1180830|00000000||Especially since the rogue last attacked in the palace gardens.
   1180832|00000000||I… trust Her Illustrious Highness was not harmed…?
   1171010|00000000||Kind of you to ask, Master Fabricio. I am well.
   1171012|00000000||Your… Your Grace…? We were not warned. I shall order the salon prepared at once.
   1171014|00000000||That won't be necessary. As you can see, we are not here on an official visit.
   1171016|00000000||Naturally. Might I ask, then, what has brought you to Castel Ravello?
   1161444|00000000||My men stand ready. Say the word and we will make for Fort Astre. It is time to catch these wine thieves.
   1196903|00000000||Master Fabricio, I am very disappointed.
   1199934|00000000||But Your Grace… I…
   1199936|00000000||You are a step away from losing your head. Speak the truth and you might yet keep it.
   1171897|00000000||I… I admit it! I-I-I sold a b-barrel of S-sangreal… I beg you to forgive me…
   1185388|00000000||Why did you do it?
   1185390|00000000||I couldn't resist… The sum they offered, it was enormous. I gave in…
   1185392|00000000||Is what I provide not enough?
   1185394|00000000||I wished to buy back my family's estate. For here, nothing is truly mine. I've a roof over my head, ample food to eat, but… what is a nobleman without land of his own?
   1196938|00000000||I shall tell you everything, if you agree to show me mercy…
   1196999|00000000||How'd you deliver the wine?
   1197003|00000000||Wine itself - how'd you hand it over?
   1196989|00000000||We met under the cover of darkness in the ruins of Fort Astre. A dozen or so men came to collect. Armed men, the kind that stink of trouble.
   1196991|00000000||I had hauled the barrel there, they transferred it to their cart, and we went our separate ways.
   1196993|00000000||That's it? That the last you ever saw of them?
   1196995|00000000||They… That is to say, a few days past a messenger arrived. He said they wish to buy another barrel and… well, I've prepared it, have it ready to deliver.
   1171920|00000000||Who'd you sell the wine to?
   1185402|00000000||Who'd you sell the wine to?
   1185404|00000000||A few weeks past at the Pheasantry a rich nobleman approached me. He called himself a diplomat, well-connected at court.
   1196977|00000000||He suggested we embark on an enterprise. Some of his "clients" had offered dizzying sums for even a drop of Sangreal… He was to serve as intermediary.
   1196979|00000000||This man's name.
   1196981|00000000||He never revealed it. He was tall, black-haired and spoke with a foreign lilt. He claimed to hail from Cintra.
   1197001|00000000||I've no Cintrian aristocrat at court.
   1171921|00000000||Really thought nobody'd find out?
   1171923|00000000||Really thought nobody'd find out?
   1171925|00000000||I was a fool, very foolish. I beg you, Your Grace, you must forgive me…
   1171934|00000000||That's enough.
   1171940|00000000||That's enough. Know all we need to know.
   1197016|00000000||Your Grace… I beg your forgiveness…
   1171946|00000000||Get out of my sight.
   1198939|00000000||Captain, have your men take Master Fabricio to the dungeon. He must answer for his crime - high treason the charge.
   1171949|00000000||What now, witcher?
   1171959|00000000||We set a trap. Need to catch the wine thieves - Cintrian noble could be our blackmailer.
   1171961|00000000||Next transport - I'll take it to Fort Astre. Damien and his soldiers'll cover me.
   1171963|00000000||For once, I agree with you. We will do as you say. Let me know when you are ready.
   1162264|00000000||See no reason to wait. Let's get going.
   1162266|00000000||We will set out now, position ourselves before you arrive. You take the cart and meet us there.
   1185662|00000000||Fine. When the handoff begins, watch for my signal.
   1162012|00000000||We can start.
   1162268|00000000||Need a minute.
   1162270|00000000||Make haste. We await only you.
   1162013|00000000||I'll be back soon.
   1157832|00000000||We would not have made it far without Your Grace.
   1157834|00000000||The important bit is yet to come.
   1209924|00000000||Witcher, hurry.
   1189721|00000000||I've had enough. Of all of it.
   1189723|00000000||Let me live.
   1189725|00000000||It's thin scrapings around here! At least the weather's pleasant…
   1189727|00000000||Ehh, how's a man to live…?
   1046403|a2127f6c||Herold
   1207024|00000000||It seems they've settled their dispute.
   1207026|00000000||All right, the excitement's done. Please disperse.
   1207020|00000000||At the door of the bank! They're at it again!
   1207028|00000000||It's the third time this week.
   1207022|00000000||I wager ten on the one on the right!
   1034137|cfe4cfd3||Patient
   1198473|00000000||You endangered your own flesh to defend our duchy from the Beast. Praised be your name!
   1198475|00000000||Praised be Geralt, slayer of vampires!
   1190541|00000000||My sword marks my path.
   1190539|00000000||Cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.
   1190547|00000000||You shall reap what you sow!
   1190545|00000000||Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil!
   1190543|00000000||Tou-ssaint!
   1190549|00000000||I follow my destiny.
   1190551|00000000||You cannot escape your destiny.
   1190553|00000000||I'm watching you, witcher.
   1125208|00000000||Too quick for you, huh?
   1125206|00000000||Block, you old goose!
   1125202|00000000||Hey, master witcher! Will you face Colossus? Folk say those of your guild pack a thunderous punch.
   1125204|00000000||Pff, he's as old as Father William. I smack him once, he'll spend a week wondering if anyone saw the crest on the carriage that ran him over.
   1125200|00000000||Who dares challenge the mighty Colossus? His strength rivaled only by his speed! Who stands to parry such blows?
   1125210|00000000||Prove your worth. I shan't waste my breath on you till you do.
   1190817|00000000||Stop pesterin'.
   1190819|00000000||Dum dum duh dum dum…
   1190821|00000000||You fucking twat!
   1190823|00000000||Hit the mutant!
   1190825|00000000||You'll rot in the dungeon.
   1190827|00000000||Now you've done it.
   1190829|00000000||Wise.
   1190831|00000000||Put your sword away, now.
   1191745|00000000||Hip, hip, hurrah! Long live Geralt, our savior!

   1156485|00000000||Welcome, good sir, to Dupont & Sons Emporium of Diverse Merchandise. Satisfaction guaranteed!
   1188509|00000000||Instead of chatting… why not a quick game of gwent?
   1188507|00000000||Gwent - fancy a game?
   1156498|00000000||So long.
   1156490|00000000||Farewell.
   1156488|00000000||Lemme see what's so diverse.
   1156492|00000000||Show me what you got back there.
   1156487|00000000||Welcome, please peruse! The best diverse wares in Toussaint at the best prices!
   1161902|00000000||Dammit.
   1161900|00000000||Argh! Almost had it.
   1162348|00000000||Gardens're huge. Be better off on horseback.
   1185712|00000000||Roach wont' eat bread, either. Except if it's stale…
   1185710|00000000||Cold game's not likely to tempt a unicorn.
   1185708|00000000||Roach likes carrots. Maybe unicorn will, too…
   1185714|00000000||Think unicorns - rainbows, little girls… sweets, maybe?
   1185716|00000000||Crispy apple - should like that like any other damn horse.
   1185946|00000000||What would you say to a delicious, crunchy carrot?
   1185944|00000000||An apple - yum, yum.
   1186292|00000000||Too jumpy. Need to give it some space.
   1186422|00000000||Try it - it's tasty.
   1161898|00000000||Come on. Stay calm.
   1185942|00000000||Damn, doesn't have a sweet tooth.
   1194474|00000000||A-a-achoo!
   1194476|00000000||Don't know what to believe anymore.
   1194490|00000000||Enough to feed the tykes…
   1194492|00000000||Eh, if only me purse weren't empty.
   1194478|00000000||Mornin'.
   1194480|00000000||How is everyone?
   1194494|00000000||Where ya goin'?!
   1194496|00000000||No, please no…
   1194618|00000000||How're things?
   1194620|00000000||What a day…
   1124673|abb4baf6||Count Tailles of Dorndal
   1179056|00000000||You… you gave me… hic! The hiccups!
   1195499|00000000||You slew Starling Straggen - hic! - now I'll slay you…
   1195495|00000000||Hic! That's him! Hic! The murderer! He killed Loth Halfbreed!
   1195497|00000000||We shan't go as easily - hic! - as Fourfingers' hanse!
   1179058|00000000||Hiccup! Blast!
   1179060|00000000||I shall ki-- hic! Feck! Kill you!
   1179054|00000000||Arrrrgh! Hiccup! These hiccups are - hic! - driving me mad!!
   1179062|00000000||Faster! Hiccup! Faster!
   1179064|00000000||Bloody stool! Hic!
   1179066|00000000||Lebioda's weeping - hiccup! -wounds!
   1179068|00000000||Take cover!
   1188807|00000000||Leave me to live in peace.
   1188805|00000000||Whaddaya want?
   1198915|00000000||Vermentino and Coronata, merged… who would have thunk…
   1188809|00000000||If I see that tittering tart again, I swear it, I'll scratch her eyes out…
   1188811|00000000||The hussy's got a waist thin as a rod, but her bum could fit a pack of hounds…
   1197254|51f3d714||Monsieur de Bourbeau
   1195316|00000000||Yea?
   1195318|00000000||Plough the fuck off.
   1195320|00000000||Come on!
   1195322|00000000||Yaaawn…
   1195324|00000000||Cover your eyes!
   1195326|00000000||Aaaargh!
   1195328|00000000||Now, left! Leeeft!
   1195330|00000000||Take him from the back!
   1195332|00000000||This ain't doing shit!
   1195334|00000000||You're carrion!
   1195336|00000000||Watch where you're walkin'?!
   1195338|00000000||That's annoying.
   1189799|00000000||The witcher had made his way to the infamous ruins of the Old Amphitheatre, where - no surprise - he found the mortal remains of a young woman. Alongside them he found her beautifully scented diary.<br>
   1189800|00000000||The ambitious would-be artiste had come here to reenact a scene performed at this very theatre by the erstwhile queen of its stage. Something had gone wrong…Geralt, no stranger to the art of mummery, decided to reenact the scene as well.<br>
   1207862|00000000||Then as was his wont, he ferreted a bit. He found a secret nook in the prompter's box and inside the nook a not insignificant prize!<br>
   1189801|00000000||The witcher played his role his role as the script said he must and put much heart into the performance. Yet at this ruined venue he expected no applause. And a good thing, too, because the sole spectator was a phantom, who Geralt promptly dispatched with his silver sword!<br>
   1189802|00000000||Read the diary.
   1189803|00000000||Find a way to reenact the scene using your Witcher Senses.
   1189810|00000000||Defeat the wraith that has appeared.
   1207205|00000000||Search the wraith's remains.
   1207760|00000000||Return to the amphitheater and finish the scene.
   1207759|00000000||Finish the scene by drinking wine.
   1207856|00000000||Find the hidden coffer.
   1207863|00000000||Figure out the order in which you should light the candles.
   1189798|00000000||But Other Than That, How Did You Enjoy the Play?
   1179860|00000000||Great, portals… This just keeps getting better.
   1182756|00000000||Dammit, wrong again… Could be some clue around here…
   1182758|00000000||Statues seem oddly oriented, as if to all face in one direction… the right portal, maybe?
   1187480|00000000||Grave robber must've found something in Moreau's tomb to activate the entry portal. Wonder what surprises this place has in store…
   1187482|00000000||Dammit, traps. Gotta keep an eye out.
   1187532|00000000||Ghaarrr! Unwanted guest! Intruder! You are not welcome here!
   1187623|00000000||Yeah, figured as much.
   1187561|00000000||Hm. Impressive… This just decoration or…?
   1187609|00000000||Hm. Interesting as places go. Seems someone put a lot of thought into its design. Should look around.
   1187897|00000000||Gargoyles sure don't look willing to help.
   1187484|00000000||Giant stone sphere, crushes everything in its path… Subtle.
   1200888|00000000||Dammit. Back where I started.
   1200890|00000000||All right. Now to find the next portal.
   1206306|00000000||Implanted spikes. Sick sense of humor, someone's got.
   1206308|00000000||Never liked cats.
   1206310|00000000||Oh, crap! Didn't I just do this?
   1206742|00000000||Need to find something to open it.
   1206740|00000000||Hmm… Notes I found mention four protruding stones. Gotta press them somehow. Crossbow, maybe? Could try to hit them.
   1206312|00000000||Course. Locked.
   1206314|00000000||Hah. Did it.
   1206316|00000000||Hm, seems someone besides me might be ferreting around here.
   1206318|00000000||Someone slim. No way I can slink through there. Need to find a way around.
   1206320|00000000||Blood-soaked… Grave robber was wounded while attempting the climb, needed to bandage up. Managed to avoid the panthers, at least.
   1210158|00000000||Not bad. Wouldn't mind having something like that myself.
   1210156|00000000||Whoever was here must've scaled that wall, evaded the panthers.
   1208927|00000000||<i>Why bother with brick? In this climate, even a straw house's nice and cozy.</i><br> – a little pig<br><br>The three little pigs are perfect examples of a rather unfortunate phenomenon. Leave even a kind-hearted, warm, naively benign creature to fend for itself, and it won't remain so benign for long.<br<br>The three little pigs from the Land of a Thousand Fables were left for years without Artorius Vigo's supervision. During this time they went completely feral, transforming into three wild boars which attacked anyone who dared approach their ruined home.

   1180137|00000000||Geralt? Why have you come? Forgotten already? The murderer you were to kill lives, while the duquessa's sister lies dead.
   1179712|00000000||Got something to tell the duchess. About her sister.
   1179722|00000000||Before you start dumping accusations on me, think you should know something. Syanna… she was a vicious, wicked, woman.
   1179724|00000000||Who are you to tell me who my own sister was?!
   1179726|00000000||I'm the man you hired to investigate the Beast of Beauclair. And I found a letter your sister wrote to the murderer.
   1179734|00000000||Really? Maybe you should read it, then. It could be important…
   1179738|00000000||You read it, Dandelion. Aloud, to me.
   1184612|00000000||"This time you must see to our duquessa. Anna Henrietta knows nothing of empathy. Her heart is cold. This shard of ice you must tear from her breast."
   1184615|00000000||My sister could never have written that.
   1184617|00000000||Got proof she did.
   1184619|00000000||No… I don't believe you, I don't believe it. Someone seeks to blacken her in my eyes. I won't allow it.
   1184621|00000000||There, there, Anarietta. Don't get upset.
   1184623|00000000||The letter is vile, it's slander! You must destroy it, do you hear?! No one else must ever read it! Ever!
   1184625|00000000||Consider it done…
   1185746|00000000||And you - out! Get out of here! This is all your doing! Begone, hear me?! I never wish to see you again!
   1198560|00000000||I shall never believe she did this! She was not capable! This is an outrage! Dandelion, tell him it's not true! Tell him it's a dirty lie…
   1198572|00000000||Geralt, get out of here, please? The duchess, she needs to be alone…
   1179714|00000000||Didn't come here to upset you, m'Lady. Just… found this letter and thought you, if anyone, oughta read it, know what it says.
   1179716|00000000||You are not one to tell me what I should or should not do.
   1179718|00000000||Syanna wrote it. To the murderer.
   1179711|00000000||Don't want to upset the duchess.
   1179700|00000000||Remember, my dear Anarietta, despair is like a stormy sky. Sooner or later, the sun must drive away the clouds.
   1179702|00000000||That is easy for you to say. The one murdered was not your sister.
   1179704|00000000||My life hasn't exactly been a bed of roses. True, my sister wasn't murdered, don't even have a sister, actually, but many times I've lost… Ugh, unimportant.
   1179707|00000000||Your Grace…
   1178435|00000000||The impudence you must harbor to come in here after all that's happened!
   1179710|00000000||Calm down, I'm sure Geralt's got a very good reason. Right, Geralt?
   1178148|00000000||Wouldn't 'ave come if I didn't have to, promise you that. But I've learned something, something that might interest Anna Henrietta.
   1179694|00000000||Hm. Forgive me if I lend no credence to your word.
   1178150|00000000||Found a letter Syanna wrote… to the murderer.
   1179696|00000000||Hm. Very well. You may enter. But I make no promises as regards the duquessa. She mourns her sister in the ducal crypt. Viscount de Lettenhove is with her.
   1180135|00000000||I did not think you'd show again. Need I remind you? The duquessa's sister lies dead due to your negligence. Yet still you have the gall to come?

   1174921|00000000||I buy, I sell, I barter. Gadzooks, I do everything but scratch your nose!
   1174919|00000000||Greetings!
   1174923|00000000||Were the good Prophet Lebioda lively and spry, from me he would everything buy!
   1174925|00000000||My prices are the best this side of the Yaruga!
   1198819|00000000||Witcher! Looking to buy? Come see!
   1174929|00000000||Save me! Robbery! Theft!
   1174927|00000000||Darn you!
   1198821|00000000||Don't be shy, witcher! Come, peruse my wares!
   1168512|00000000||Please, master, tarry not. I beg you, I must know my François' fate!
   1168520|00000000||My slippers, ecru… court shoes with a moderately raised heel… and a ribbon!
   1181362|00000000||Witcher. Wonder how much he makes…
   1181360|00000000||Why don't you get to work, you ploughing twitcher…
   1181366|00000000||Well? What now?
   1181364|00000000||You're bored - is that it?
   1175027|00000000||Hanging in there?
   1175029|00000000||It… it grows… worse and worse… but I shall overcome…
   1181593|00000000||Good, 'cause I can hear more coming.
   1175013|00000000||Maybe we need a safe word? You know, something you'll say when you can't take it any more.
   1175015|00000000||And what would you do once I uttered it?
   1175017|00000000||Don't know. Uh, calm you down… somehow…
   1181574|00000000||Please, Geralt. You won't be able to. We must forge through this, that is all.
   1175025|00000000||Aha. Regis has smelled the blood…
   1181591|00000000||Aaaaarrrggh!
   1191350|00000000||Bait's set. What now?
   1191352|00000000||I shall enter the cage. You must chain me inside. The bars are made of an alloy that will prevent me from transforming into mist.
   1191354|00000000||Kinda thought you wouldn't want to.
   1191356|00000000||I shall be in great pain, my sole thought being to stop that pain. I cannot know what I will do.
   1191359|00000000||We must hurry. The beasts have caught the scent. Also, my head's started spinning.
   1191361|00000000||That the blood?
   1191363|00000000||Someone who's never experienced a vampire's bloodlust… does not know the true meaning of thirst.
   1175031|00000000||Aaaarrrrrgghhh!
   1175035|00000000||Hold on! I'll let you out!
   1192224|00000000||That smell!
   1192218|00000000||Aaaaarrrggh!
   1192222|00000000||Aaaaarrrggh!
   1192230|00000000||Aaaaarrrggh!
   1192226|00000000||Grrrrrhrrrrr!
   1192228|00000000||Aaaaarrrggh!
   1175033|00000000||That's it. He's transformed.
   1209689|00000000||Saint Plegmund's toes! You're… you're Geralt of Rivia!
   1209687|00000000||Would you hunt my beastly mother-in-law?
   1209691|00000000||Hey! Sword, sheathe it, now.
   1209695|00000000||Whack him! Whack him good!
   1209697|00000000||We will teach you decency!
   1209693|00000000||Ashes, ashes, the wolf falls down!
   1209701|00000000||Gads, my knees ache something horrible…
   1209699|00000000||All work and no play, right, witcher?
   1209703|00000000||Hold it! Where are your manners?!
   1119411|caac7725||Squire
   1172907|00000000||Go in good health!
   1172909|00000000||Careful, they say one can catch the "Nilfgaardian disease" at the Belles…
   1198489|00000000||Gods… the duquessa - dead!
   1172911|00000000||Did you hear all that banging and moaning? On the tourney grounds?
   1172913|00000000||Here practically one in two men has either a swollen head or a swollen liver.
   1172915|00000000||I will summon the guards!
   1172917|00000000||That hurt!
   1167517|00000000||Mm, you're big, you're bad, Wolf. Would you be my lifting buddy?
   1191838|00000000||Whew, a last-minute rescue… Thank you, witcher!
   1196375|00000000||But that's complete and utter hogwash.
   1196377|00000000||Ooh la la!
   1183763|00000000||Ahem, listen to this - "The witcher of whitened locks, harkened to the people's cries, and cleft in twain the foul Beast's hocks, so it shall never its terror reprise."
   1183765|00000000||Is that how it's to be, witcher? You save us from the Beast, and Her Grace - hop-chop, off with his head?
   1183759|00000000||Dooo! Reee! Miii! Fiddlesticks, I'm always off-key when hungover.
   1183761|00000000||Right and true, the knight returned from his days at war, yet the lass for whom he'd pined and yearned, had married just days before.
   1183773|00000000||Change your foot-wrappings, mate! Ugh!
   1183767|00000000||Cheerio!
   1183769|00000000||All your damn bums be botched!
   1196382|00000000||Ravix, the chap who won the tourney - do you know the man? Apparently, he's no knight at all! And his name's not Ravix, but Geralt!
   1196380|00000000||Geralt, the chap who won the tourney - do you know the man? Apparently, he's no knight at all!
   1196378|00000000||Apparently they're to ban racing come springtime. Know why? Some druids wrote the duchess, complaining it tires the mounts!
   1183771|00000000||Save me!
   1184710|00000000||Every man in this city's a permanently plastered loon…
   1184712|00000000||They think of naught but taking you for a romp midst the vines…
   1184716|00000000||Sod off.
   1184714|00000000||Do not look, do not touch.
   1042786|5bac368a||Rabid Dog
   1055163|e128b05b||Nilfgaardian Nobleman
   1202302|00000000||Hello, Geralt.
   1202300|00000000||Witcher?
   1202324|00000000||Ugh, ugly and fierce!
   1202326|00000000||I shall butcher you!
   1202304|00000000||You rat bastard!
   1194446|00000000||You!
   1194448|00000000||You'll frighten me kiddies!
   1144257|00000000||Best cure for the Beast? A witcher!
   1144255|00000000||The Guard brings peace to our domains - flout its writ and rot in chains!
   1192743|00000000||Geralt! I knew from the start you'd best the Beast!
   1144259|00000000||All together, now!
   1144263|00000000||Seems you're but a dog's dingle berry, witcher!
   1144265|00000000||Toussaint!
   1144267|00000000||Lock him up! And swallow the key!
   1144261|00000000||For the duquessa!
   1144275|00000000||Darnit, watch where you step, fool!
   1144277|00000000||Spells! Magic!
   1144279|00000000||Deep breath, witcher.
   1144269|00000000||Courage, men!
   1144281|00000000||Witcher…
   1144283|00000000||Witchcraft! Spells!
   1144285|00000000||You asked for it!
   1144287|00000000||That's what I like to see!
   1144273|00000000||Geralt! Well met!
   1144271|00000000||Well? Will you stay long?
   1184859|00000000||I'm a werewolf! Grrrrowl!
   1184857|00000000||Look! I've grown hair on my knuckles!
   1194042|00000000||Pfffrrrrt!
   1194044|00000000||Oy, rotten times.
   1194046|00000000||Aaaah!
   1184114|00000000||Your Excellency, a pure pleasure to play you.
   1184116|00000000||The pleasure was mutual, I assure you. Congratulations, witcher.
   1184118|00000000||Congratulations. Good win.
   1184120|00000000||Thank you. An exciting match, to say the least.
   1188399|00000000||In the grand finale, Ambassador von Hinn shall face Count Monnier!
   1198247|00000000||What exactly is your problem?
   1198329|00000000||Maybe instead of hollering threats, you oughta just explain what it is you want.
   1199777|00000000||We've said it, plenty o' times. Yet no one ever listens!
   1199779|00000000||Got me listening.
   1199781|00000000||Gwent's an ancient pastime. Its rules were set ages ago.
   1199783|00000000||Exactly! Determined in keepin' wit' the laws o' nature!
   1199785|00000000||There should be four factions. That is the optimal number!
   1199789|00000000||We'll not tolerate the introduction of any others! It would disgrace the tradition!
   1198331|00000000||Aye! Leave our gwent the fuck alone!
   1198337|00000000||Enough o' this! Dinnae come here to jabber, but to break fuckin' heids in defense o' tradition! C'mon, lads!
   1198335|00000000||Get out of here. Before my patience runs thin.
   1199791|00000000||Hear that? Guttershite's threatenin' us! Only one answer tae verbal aggression o' that sort!
   1199793|00000000||Once more, I beg and plead - remain calm…
   1199795|00000000||Shut yer yap, Monnier!
   1198246|00000000||Get out!
   1199713|00000000||Stop desecratin' gwent!
   1199715|00000000||Death tae any and all new factions!
   1199717|00000000||Seems there's some trouble brewing…
   1199719|00000000||Scoot - all o' youse! Off yer arses and hie to Skellige, ye isle-lovin' seal-slurpers!
   1199721|00000000||Please remain calm and stop the verbal attacks.
   1199723|00000000||Stop yer mum from fuckin' ferrets, Monnier! And hands off our gwent!
   1198317|00000000||It seems you had a stroke of ill luck.
   1199677|00000000||Your Excellency played better, that's all.
   1153914|00000000||Is something not in order, sir?
   1159455|00000000||Why's this man on the floor?
   1159457|00000000||Perhaps you should ask him that.
   1159459|00000000||Why are you lying there?
   1159461|00000000||Taking a rest. First day in the laundry. Didn't realize it could be so tiring.
   1153916|00000000||Harlotsbroods. Solitary for the lot of you. You'll have ample time to consider, think about the choices you've made in life. I'll make certain of it.
   1169790|00000000||Didn't do anything to deserve solitary.
   1169792|00000000||Shut it!
   1172463|00000000||Milton was my cousin. You let him die. Was the duquessa's coin not enough? Did you expect more to save a good man's life?
   1172465|00000000||Arrived too late. Nothing I could do.
   1172467|00000000||And when the Beast tore apart the duquessa's sister? Too late then, too? Were it up to me, you'd have hanged already.
   1172469|00000000||And don't you try any witcher tricks on me. You will end oh so badly if you do.
   1153912|00000000||Nothing.
   1159446|00000000||I am not asking you, but the one on the floor. Have you anything to say?
   1159448|00000000||I slipped on some soap.
   1159450|00000000||You slipped. On soap…
   1159452|00000000||Lots of soap here - it is a laundry…
   1153904|00000000||What is going on here?!
   1055413|f7a0c879||Nekker Warrior
   1183136|00000000||Drizzledung!
   1183134|00000000||Ehhh?
   1183138|00000000||Somehow the work's uphill both ways today.
   1183140|00000000||Work, wrath, and women - all best in moderation!
   1187663|00000000||They say Her Grace has called in someone to tend to the Beast. A killer from the North, they say.
   1195450|00000000||What? We've no lads brave enough?
   1195452|00000000||Of course we have. But bravery's not enough against the Beast. It wields dark powers… That calls for a witcher. Or a mage.
   1160527|00000000||The river surrendered a corpse. It washed up in the meander by the Cockatrice. Damien de la Tour's guardsmen are there already, securing the area.
   1160529|00000000||"Securing the area"? Better go there now, before they trample any tracks, manhandle any evidence.
   1160533|00000000||Set forth, then. I shall ride for the city to inform Her Gracious Magnificence that Geralt has arrived. We'll meet later, near Guillaume's tent at the tourney grounds. I shall take you then to see Her Grace.
   1160510|00000000||I'll take the trophy, why not. Could find someone who'll pay to buy it.
   1192656|00000000||Put up a good fight against the giant. Got experience battling monsters?
   1192658|00000000||None. In Toussaint, we mostly chase bandits. But I vowed I'd bring my heart's champion the head of a monstrosity. As the famed Gottfried, known as the Giantkiller, did.
   1192664|00000000||You don't mean to hunt the Beast, I hope? The matter's best left to Geralt.
   1192666|00000000||Another challenge awaits me. Yet if Geralt is to hunt the Beast, he ought to know - it's struck again.
   1156593|00000000||Glad to take the trophy. You did well against the giant.
   1167973|00000000||How'd a giant wind up here?
   1167975|00000000||A giant this close to human settlements? Strange.
   1167977|00000000||That was no ordinary giant - his name was Golyat. Rumored to have been a knight once, but one who broke his vows. For this, the Lady of the Lake transformed him into a wild giant and banished him into the Gorgon Hills.
   1168005|00000000||So he came back down? Why?
   1168007|00000000||Several times each year hunger chased him into the lowlands. Golyat had killed and devoured many shepherds. Guillaume's hunt served a noble cause.
   1168009|00000000||At any rate, it's a tale for more agreeable environs.
   1167968|00000000||Big beast. Tackling it single-handed? None too wise.
   1156582|00000000||Neither is love born of wisdom, witcher. So, Guillaume, out with it - which fair damsel inspired you to vow to kill that filth?
   1156584|00000000||The most beautiful among them.
   1160442|00000000||If he wishes to guard her name a secret, he need not reveal it.
   1160452|00000000||You I do not know, sir, nor seem you a knight, yet still I am profoundly grateful, nay, indebted to you for your succor. This trophy, sir, is yours.
   1184140|00000000||According to legend, Golyat had once been a knight who violated his vows, for which he was punished by the Lady of the Lake. Transformed into a giant, he fled into the mountains and would only descend into the inhabited lowlands when hunger forced him to it. There’s no knowing how much truth lies in that legend, yet it is incontrovertible fact that this dangerous giant gobbled up shepherds and sheep alike, and was so widely feared, governesses used him to scare children into eating their vegetables.<br><br>Though he came across as a wild, unthinking beast, Golyat used simple tools and any item could turn into a deadly weapon in his powerful hands. When fighting Geralt, Golyat wielded a millstone, making his every blow truly crushing. Luckily, Geralt already had some experience slaying giants and made quick work of Golyat as well, with the much appreciated help of three knights - Milton de Peyrac Peyran, Palmerin de Launfal and Guillaume de Launfal.
   1184139|00000000||Golyat
   1152217|00000000||My soul cannot handle this… it simply cannot. Oh, Lebioda's wounds!
   1199633|00000000||Calm down. It's over.
   1199639|00000000||I thank you, sir. And you must forgive me my momentary loss of composure. Are you in need of accoutrements, monsieur?
   1152219|00000000||Hail, sir! Do you require anything?
   1152226|00000000||Villa looks abandoned. You its owner?
   1152228|00000000||More its temporary steward. By order of the treasury minister, I am to serve as caretaker of Count de Launay's properties and estates. The count is missing.
   1201814|00000000||Yet no one at the palace warned me Villa Vedette is the lair of bandits! That is to say, it was but is no more - thanks to your heroism, monsieur witcher!
   1152221|00000000||What're you doing here?
   1204890|00000000||Looking for scrolls, manuscripts. Bearing diagrams of witcher gear, specifically. Any chance you've happened on any?
   1204892|00000000||I've not yet managed to inventory the sundries. I arrived just a short while ago. The bandits arrived with their terror…
   1204932|00000000||But you may ferret about if you so wish.
   1204888|00000000||Witcher diagrams - I'm looking for some.
   1152230|00000000||Thanks. So long.
   1152222|00000000||Farewell.
   1152220|00000000||Mind showing me your wares?
   1152224|00000000||What do you have that you're willing to sell?
   1195961|00000000||What a nightmare! What a horror! Grotesque and macabre!
   1126935|00000000||While traversing Toussaint, Geralt learned local aficionados of wine and raucous entertainment were fond of organizing fistfighting tournaments as well. He decided to enter the lists.<br>
   1126936|00000000||The witcher defeated a triumvirate of challengers. He told me later some of them were quite colorful characters!<br>This feat qualified him to fight in a bout against the reigning master of the Toussaint fistfighting circuit.<br>
   1126925|00000000||Defeat Mancomb in a fistfight.
   1126926|00000000||Defeat Still Waters in a fistfight.
   1126927|00000000||Defeat Colossus in a fistfight.
   1177224|00000000||Parry Colossus' blows at the right moment.
   1126924|00000000||Fists of Fury: Toussaint
   1178546|00000000||You sure you don't feel lonely out here?
   1178548|00000000||I cannot say, yet. Too little time has passed since you freed me of my thrall. But somehow… for now, at least, I do not feel drawn to the city, to others.
   1196783|00000000||Visited others' homes as a wight.
   1196785|00000000||Yes, but ever at night, when all were asleep. I went in search of spoons…
   1196787|00000000||Remember, you can always change your mind. Decide you've lived here long enough, just say the word.
   1196789|00000000||I'd never wish to seem ungrateful.
   1196791|00000000||And I'd never want you to stay against your will.
   1178537|00000000||Not lonely? Don't miss the company of others?
   1178382|00000000||Where'd you learn to cook?
   1178542|00000000||I'd never expect someone with your past to feel drawn to the kitchen…
   1178544|00000000||Do you fear I will cook in your home as I brewed as a wight?
   1196775|00000000||Heheh, counting on you having slightly better taste as a human.
   1196777|00000000||Of that you can be sure. I loved cooking, even as a child. My gran was a true master in the kitchen. Her spit-roasted ox was famed throughout the land.
   1196779|00000000||Thought you were a lady, owned an estate.
   1196781|00000000||Do you mean to say a woman of my rank should have had a cook? You're right, of course. And I had the best of cooks. But I devised the dishes myself. They only prepared them.
   1178363|00000000||I do not know how I will ever repay you, witcher.
   1196745|00000000||Don't expect to be paid. Hope you're feeling better, that's all.
   1196747|00000000||Oh, yes. I feel my strength returning, thanks chiefly to Barnabas-Basil's care.
   1196749|00000000||Horrible ordeal you endured. Glad I cut it short.
   1196751|00000000||Yes… years of suffering. Do you know what was worse than the hunger? Watching my loved ones… my children, grow old and die.
   1196753|00000000||All my family's long gone, now. The last of my kin perished decades past. I fear I've nowhere to go.
   1178375|00000000||Don't fear life, don't fear the world, don't fear others. Won't be easy after all these years, I know, but believe me… you belong among them.
   1196755|00000000||But… I've no one out there.
   1196757|00000000||Your family's gone - doesn't mean you won't meet someone new, grow to love them.
   1178377|00000000||You really think so?
   1196759|00000000||I'm sure of it.
   1196761|00000000||In that case, I thank you once more for your hospitality, for everything… Live well and prosper.
   1196763|00000000||Everything'll work out, you'll see. Farewell.
   1178368|00000000||Go to town. Start a new life.
   1178369|00000000||You can stay here.
   1178379|00000000||This is a big house, big estate. You can stay here.
   1196765|00000000||Truly? I could never infringe so on your hospitality. Yet…
   1196767|00000000||Yeah?
   1196769|00000000||After all I've suffered, the years of starvation, I've but one dream - at last to prepare food that fortifies, nourishes, to delight in the tastes and smells of spices, to sit at one table with others and eat…
   1196771|00000000||Hmm… Don't see a problem if that's your dream. You could help Barnabas-Basil in the kitchen. Eaten his meals, you know he's not a culinary virtuoso.
   1178381|00000000||Nothing would make me happier. Thank you!
   1201700|00000000||No, thank you. House could use a woman's touch.
   1201702|00000000||I've one other thing I'd like to tell you. Many years ago my father assembled valuables for my dowry. I never wed, so they remained unclaimed. These baubles are no use to me now, but to you… Well, perhaps let them be a token of my gratitude.
   1201704|00000000||If you wish to find them, you must go to my old home, to Trastamara. The dowry lies hidden in a barrel in the cellar. There are several barrels, you must give each a knock until you find the right one.
   1201706|00000000||Do just that. Thanks.
   1178538|00000000||Take care.
   1178540|00000000||See you later.
   1196773|00000000||Take care, witcher. And remember, you always have warm food awaiting your return.
   1178536|00000000||I thank you for letting me stay. I cannot remember when last I was this happy.
   1150374|00000000||So… this is my true form. It is not too late, you may still change your mind. It would bring no shame.
   1200795|00000000||My mind is made up, my resolve is firm. If you can handle it, so will I. You are beautiful to me, even as you stand now.
   1200797|00000000||Oh, that's clearly rubbish.
   1150376|00000000||Shut your eyes, both of you, and don't move.
   1200852|00000000||Guillaume…?
   1200854|00000000||Yes, my love?
   1200857|00000000||If you become as I am now, I wish you to know - I shall not leave you.
   1150382|00000000||Picture yourselves reflected in a pool of water. Focus on that…
   1205455|00000000||Now… open your eyes.
   1150388|00000000||Damn… Think it might've worked.
   1200987|00000000||My work is done.
   1200991|00000000||Up to you, now. Here's hoping you'll solve your own problems, and never run into any that require a witcher.
   1200993|00000000||Still, watch yourselves carefully. Notice any troubling symptoms, find me.
   1200995|00000000||Naturally. I thank you, Geralt. Oh, and your payment.
   1201005|00000000||Ahh… At last! I've so much to make up for! Balls to attend! Distant lands to see!
   1211186|00000000||Free at last… as a bird.
   1211189|00000000||Hah! I find you droll. I had not noticed before.
   1211191|00000000||But you will not fly away without me?
   1201007|00000000||That remains to be seen, I think… But I, too, must thank you, witcher.
   1201009|00000000||Don't mention it. You take care, both.
   1200985|00000000||Now? Now you get to live together, happily ever after.
   1200886|00000000||You get to live happily ever after.
   1200981|00000000||How do you feel? In general. You feel a change, Guillaume?
   1200967|00000000||I was struck, hard, as if by a battering ram. But now, I feel not at all different… apart from a slight itch on my skin. Are you certain it worked?
   1200969|00000000||Yes. Something happened, definitely. Must be an intersection beneath this pond. Powerful magic at work here - look at Vivienne.
   1200983|00000000||What now?
   1200901|00000000||How do you feel?
   1201013|00000000||Didn't think that'd work.
   1201036|00000000||Honestly didn't think this'd work. Doubted anything would happen. Read about this ritual in grimoires, descriptions all seemed dramatic, embellished, all stipulated a condition that seemed improbable…
   1201038|00000000||What condition was this?
   1201040|00000000||A real bond between those involved, true love.
   1197825|00000000||Die, beast!
   1197821|00000000||The aunt you mentioned… what became of her?
   1197823|00000000||She passed on.
   1211151|00000000||My Lady… Might I be allowed…? I've written… verses… with you in mind… for you… I would like to recite them. If it be your will.
   1211153|00000000||It is.
   1211155|00000000||Ahem… Your locks like waves of wheat stalks crowned gold by the sun!
   1211157|00000000||Your midriff soft as down, your voice a nightingale's trill! Errrr, no, I mean… the simile… not the best… Do forgive me.
   1211159|00000000||I mean no offense, but… I'd rather you spoke normally. Poetry puts me to sleep, I fear. Scholarly treatises - somehow I've always preferred those.
   1189304|00000000||I heard old Victor Monnart has breathed his last.
   1196548|00000000||Yeeeees, indeed… Quite the loss. A good man. Wise, too.
   1196550|00000000||Not so wise as to raise his sons properly. His body had not yet grown cold, and they were at each other's throats already.
   1196552|00000000||So it goes. Atimes even the wisest folk fail as parents. Family tribulations can defy reason and oft strain the softest of hearts.
    567286|5339532e||Butcher
   1172516|00000000||Swing your sword, I'll swing my hammer.
   1172514|00000000||I've this itch on my ding-a-ling…
   1172520|00000000||Yet limbs tall and upturned chins deny not those wise, who mount and pluck and plunge their teeth in their prize.
   1172518|00000000||Ought we begrudge fair-faced ladies their airs, when trees in high canopies hide the best apples and pears?
   1184255|00000000||The ruckus - it's terrifying at times…
   1184259|00000000||What a racket! Lively, like a herd of goats in a porcelain shop.
   1184261|00000000||Quiet down, for Lebioda's sake!
   1184263|00000000||Is nothing sacred to them? Rutting like cats in springtime, in a cemetery?! Harlotsbroods!
   1156971|00000000||What do you have to sell? Like to take a look.
   1156968|00000000||Any herbs you wanna sell?
   1164402|00000000||Take care, now.
   1156969|00000000||Farewell.
   1156967|00000000||Life of a flagellant - why'd you choose this?
   1164431|00000000||Heard flagellants whip themselves to atone for all humankind's wrongs. To appease the gods, gain their forgiveness. That why you do it?
   1156973|00000000||We've each our own reasons. I seek to atone for the suffering of a living being which once fell victim to another's vanity.
   1187474|00000000||I care not for humankind, preferring instead the company of animals.
   1156964|00000000||Witcher.
   1166746|00000000||So I told him, don't get my dander up. Because if you get my dander up, I'll get up your dander, if you get my drift!
   1166748|00000000||You told him that, did you?
   1166750|00000000||I sure did! Haven't had a speck of trouble with that sausage snarfer since. Learned his lesson.
   1166752|00000000||Well done. I can't stand that drizzledong, either.
   1196303|00000000||Good day.
   1196305|00000000||Welcome.
   1196307|00000000||Where?
   1206138|e6846748||Art Curator
   1180818|00000000||You promised to rid us of the Beast, and you kept your word. {Hael, Geralt!} [Long live Geralt!]
   1180816|00000000||I tip my hat to a guildsman such as yourself!
   1180814|00000000||{A bheil jakkten Bèist a-mhàin?} [You mean to hunt the Beast on your own?]
   1180812|00000000||{Okho, co-éineach en lagan - Vatt’ghern de Nord.} [Whoa-ho, a one-man disciplinary squad - a witcher from the North.]
   1180826|00000000||Yes?
   1180820|00000000||Hats off to you.
   1180822|00000000||Have you gone mad?
   1180824|00000000||Watch yourself!
   1193871|00000000||Meh!
   1193875|00000000||Ah yes, greetings, welcome!
   1193873|00000000||Spare me…
   1193883|00000000||Mugger!
   1193885|00000000||Akh akh akh ptooey!
   1100251|c2ae3abc||Madame de Bourbeau
   1195272|00000000||Fuck off.
   1195274|00000000||You brute!
   1158121|00000000||Then the giant belched forth a roar so horrid, it shook all the birds from the trees!
   1182670|00000000||Then what?!
   1182672|00000000||It hurled the millstone at the knights.
   1158139|00000000||Oh my!
   1158141|00000000||But virtue always trumps villainy.
   1158143|00000000||With his friends at his side, Guillaume bested Golyat and restored peace to the land.
   1182709|00000000||No. The stronger wins.
   1182727|00000000||Much as we might not like it, virtue's got nothing to do with it. Victory goes to the stronger.
   1182729|00000000||So… is there no point to being virtuous?
   1182731|00000000||Not what I said.
   1182733|00000000||Then what's needed to vanquish villains?
   1182735|00000000||A sharp sword. And some skill.
   1182737|00000000||But what if there's lots of villains and they've sharp swords, too? And lots of skill?
   1182754|00000000||That's where virtue starts to matter. 'Cause they say the gods reward the virtuous after death.
   1182710|00000000||Not always, but it's worth being good.
   1182713|00000000||Not always. Could go either way. Sometimes virtue wins, sometimes villainy gets the upper hand.
   1182715|00000000||Still worth being good.
   1182717|00000000||But why, if it doesn't mean you'll win?
   1182719|00000000||Palmerin's story - think back. A decent man attracts other good folk, makes friends he can count on. A rogue, well, he can only count on other rogues.
   1182721|00000000||And who would you rather have for a friend?
   1182723|00000000||A man of virtue?
   1182725|00000000||I must agree.
   1195221|00000000||It's late, I know, sorry to bother you. But I need to talk to the duchess.
   1195222|00000000||It's no trouble. I had not yet laid my head to rest. As to Her Illustrious Highness, I fear you will have to wait until the sun has risen again.
   1197873|00000000||Make yourself at home. Milton mentioned you'd been to Corvo Bianco to see the Beast's victim. Learn anything new from the body?
   1199023|00000000||Rather talk to the duchess right now.
   1199025|00000000||I'd like the duchess to hear what I have to say.
   1199027|00000000||We cannot disturb her at this hour.
   1199022|00000000||Brace yourself for a long story.
   1195224|00000000||Well, since we have to wait anyway, steel yourself for a long story…
   1197883|00000000||And how is it we passed from your account of the investigation to reminiscing about the succubus?
   1197885|00000000||Cause those were good times. And we were younger. Always nice to talk about that. Look - sun's up.
   1198983|00000000||Then let's tarry no more. Her Enlightened Highness is sure to have arrived at the tourney grounds by now. Let us go.
   1187841|00000000||I dedicate my imminent victory to fair Lady Vivienne!
   1193568|00000000||It's begun. The fight shall have to end first. We must wait.
   1187843|00000000||Got a bad feeling about this.
   1187847|00000000||Dammit.
   1187849|00000000||We have to help him.
   1193572|00000000||Ooph.
   1182951|00000000||Let's go.
   1182948|00000000||Let's go see the duchess.
   1182949|00000000||Who'll face the shaelmaar?
   1182941|00000000||Who's going to fight the beast?
   1182943|00000000||Guillaume - the young man you met.
   1182945|00000000||Yeah, mentioned he'd promised his heart's captor a monster trophy.
   1182947|00000000||Great love demands great sacrifices.
   1182907|00000000||Nothing's the matter.
   1182927|00000000||Sure hope you know what you're doing.
   1182929|00000000||Master beast-tamers from Nilfgaard's arenas will ensure the shaelmaar is dazed. And that is sure to delight the crowd.
   1182931|00000000||Shaelmaars're damned dangerous, even young ones. Need to be careful.
   1182906|00000000||Shouldn't torture it like that.
   1182917|00000000||Shouldn't torment the beast. How would you like to be dumped in an arena, blindfolded, with a string of bells dangling from your ass?
   1182919|00000000||Pity a monster? You? A witcher?
   1182921|00000000||I slay monsters who are a threat to humans. You're out to humiliate one to entertain a crowd.
   1182925|00000000||No knight'll gain any glory from this.
   1182909|00000000||This is dangerous. Bells on its tail aren't enough.
   1182911|00000000||I saw a spectacle of this sort at the arena in Neunreuth. There, a knight defeated a shaelmaar with bells on its tail.
   1182913|00000000||Might've gotten lucky, shaelmaar might've been lame, who knows? Only a witcher has a real chance against a healthy shaelmaar. And that's not even every witcher.
   1182915|00000000||Sides which, releasing a monster that dangerous in front of a crowd? Plain irresponsible.
   1182905|00000000||Whole thing's dangerous.
   1197720|00000000||Who's fighting? Nilfgaardian gladiators?
   1197722|00000000||Close, but not quite. As you will soon see.
   1197725|00000000||Someone's gonna fight a shaelmaar? With only some bells on its tail to confuse it, slow it down?
   1197727|00000000||Whatever is the problem? The beast is a gift, from the emperor, no less.
   1195215|00000000||Now, that will do for questions. Go find your parents.
   1195217|00000000||Her Enlightened Highness has doubtless arrived at the tourney grounds to watch the battle in the arena. If we hurry, we'll be in time to speak with her before the spectacle begins.
   1195219|00000000||Lead the way.
   1182825|00000000||Ahem, yeah, virtue always wins.
   1182827|00000000||But the Black Knight, he's a villain, and he wins.
   1182829|00000000||The Cutter of Casteldaccia, too.
   1182835|00000000||Moral victory - that's what counts.
   1182837|00000000||Rubbish.
   1163961|00000000||Yeah. Virtue always triumphs.
   1158107|00000000||Need to speak to the duchess. Urgently.
   1187518|00000000||All right, you scamps. Story's done. Go find your parents.
   1158127|00000000||But Sir Palmerin! What about the story of Riddick and the dragon?
   1158129|00000000||That tale's for another time. But take a good look at the man who stands before you now. This is Geralt of Rivia, the master witcher who lent his valiant hand to the defeat of the giant Golyat.
   1182708|00000000||Master witcher, is it true virtue always trumps villainy?
   1187386|00000000||Watch where you traipse!
   1198672|00000000||It cannot be!
   1198670|00000000||A bunch of an old wife's runny refuse!
   1187392|00000000||You tallywacked the Beast? Huh, not bad…
   1187394|00000000||There's no point weeping after the duchess. We ought to put our noses to the grindstone.
   1198897|00000000||Liam and Matilda running a vineyard together… hah!
   1200443|00000000||Those Vermentino folk - even their own children cringe at any mention of them!
   1187390|00000000||A bushel of grapes is more a burden than that steel of yours…
   1187388|00000000||Even a horse drops if you ride it at a constant gallop…
   1187396|00000000||Good folk! Help!
   1198678|00000000||Folk say the duquessa's sister was cursed! Branded by the Black Sun!
   1198676|00000000||That vineyard the witcher got? Word is the Ducal Guard had been storing stiffs there!
   1198674|00000000||They say that witcher from the North's a hardened killer! He's lopped off the head of many a king!
   1187400|00000000||Yes'm?
   1187398|00000000||Hullo.
   1165452|00000000||We professionals must stick together!
   1165450|00000000||Careful - some are likely to wipe their noses on your bundle of joy.
   1165454|00000000||A sturdy shaft, a healthy wang, ready for business, ready to bang!
   1165456|00000000||I should bake something. But a tart or a quiche?
   1189649|00000000||I'll butcher his bum, the lout.
   1189651|00000000||You've not seen my old man, have you? Eh?!
   1189653|00000000||Where's that coot gone this time…?!
   1189655|00000000||Yes, yes… likely drunk in the gutter, again.
   1198917|00000000||Faff off!
   1163399|00000000||Here to hunt that Beast, are you?
   1163397|00000000||You're the witcher? The duchess' friend?
   1163401|00000000||Crotch rot get to you?
   1163403|00000000||Blast and blimey!
   1163405|00000000||What's your angle, friend?
   1196211|00000000||I beg you… help!
   1196213|00000000||Whaaa…
   1196215|00000000||Ta ra ri ra ra.
   1165669|00000000||Well, greetings, noble sir! Please take a seat!
   1165673|00000000||Tell me, good sir, have you gathered the sum we spoke of?
   1157570|00000000||That's not even worth the spit I'd need to use to discuss it.
   1157576|00000000||Hmm… It's not quite-- I don't know…
   1199420|00000000||What's the meaning of this? The brawl - who started it?
   1199422|00000000||I'm investigating the Beast. On the duchess' orders.
   1199424|00000000||Ah yes, we've heard of you. And these men - what are they doing?
   1199414|00000000||What's the meaning of this? The brawl - who started it?
   1199416|00000000||I'm investigating the Beast. On the duchess' orders.
   1199418|00000000||Ah yes, we've heard of you. And these men - what are they doing?
   1158060|00000000||Nothing, really. Had a little misunderstanding. Figured it out, though.
   1158062|00000000||Uh-huh. I see. As the duchess' protégé, you may go. But this lot… that's another matter.
   1158064|00000000||You'll come with us. Some time in a cell ought to scare the dimwits out of you.
   1158052|00000000||Nothing. Had a misunderstanding.
   1158051|00000000||Making things difficult for me.
   1158054|00000000||Obstructing my investigation.
   1158056|00000000||Understood. Right, a few days in the clink ought to teach them not to impede official duchy business.
   1158066|00000000||Come on.
   1156773|00000000||You're very good with your fists, sir. Wouldn't be looking for work, would you? We'd make a fine duo.
   1158696|00000000||A duo? What do you mean?
   1158714|00000000||Yeah? How you imagine that working?
   1158716|00000000||Splendidly, that's how. I suggest a partnership, where I see to the boots while you stand guard.
   1158718|00000000||And as you're the stronger, come morn you'd take the chamber pot out and help me make mud.
   1158757|00000000||Bit about the mud's true? They were right to wanna box your ears.
   1158759|00000000||I've got to make a living somehow.
   1158809|00000000||So, what say you, sir? Partners?
   1158815|00000000||Lemme think about it.
   1158695|00000000||Need to ask you about Dettlaff.
   1158792|00000000||Listen, I'm interested in a certain gentleman…
   1158794|00000000||Wait, wait. Before we get to talking, please, take a seat.
   1165657|00000000||Uh, prefer going barefoot, lately… but fine, have it your way.
   1165659|00000000||Step up, have a seat, you shan't regret it.
   1165615|00000000||But my boots're clean.
   1165617|00000000||In this city, no boots are clean unless they've just come off my stand. A seat, sir, please.
   1165639|00000000||So then, who was it you wanted to ask about?
   1165641|00000000||One of your patrons. Tall, elegant black frock. Not from around here.
   1165647|00000000||An arrival? Hm, indeed, I hear a faint bell ringing… A modest sum might make it sing out loud and clear.
   1165649|00000000||How much?
   1165651|00000000||Let's say… five hundred crowns.
   1165653|00000000||What? Gotta be kidding me. What would you even do with that kind of coin?
   1165655|00000000||Expand my venture. I'm sure you can imagine. Have a proper stand with a big sign. I want a new box, too, new polishes, new brushes… and if I've enough coin left, I'll buy a share in a launderer's, get wastewater for free.
   1167228|00000000||Hm, got it all planned out…
   1167230|00000000||I should think so! Capital is all I require.
   1167362|00000000||Fine, guess I can agree to that.
   1167364|00000000||Here, your coin. Put it to good use…
   1183839|00000000||A thousand thanks, I shan't forget it. Now, to the matter at hand.
   1187297|00000000||It seems you're having a rough go of it…
   1187299|00000000||Oh, you're here. Feeling better?
   1187301|00000000||I am, thank you. The local necropolis - the air does wonders for me. Now, if I might intercede, I daresay I've the right question to ask.
   1187303|00000000||Young man, do you see this vial? One drop added to your boot polish will help you wipe even the most encrusted boot clean as the dome of Saint Lebioda's Cathedral.
   1187305|00000000||With it, you will serve three times as many patrons at a fraction of the effort. Earn piles more coin. I'm prepared to give you this vial… if you tell me where the man we seek lives.
   1187307|00000000||Uhhh…. But… you won't hurt him, will you? The gentleman's odd, true, but he's kind.
   1187309|00000000||In point of fact, he's a friend. Yet we had a falling out of sorts and would like to straighten matters out.
   1187312|00000000||I leave his boots at the door of a house near the port. The door is red. But I do not know if the gentleman lives there.
   1187314|00000000||Worth checking. Might happen on a lead.
   1187316|00000000||Would you let me scrape the dirt off your kickers before you go? With all due respect, sirs, your boots could stand a cleaning.
   1187319|00000000||Thank you. Perhaps later.
   1183841|00000000||I know the fellow you seek, though I don't know his name. A steady patron, gets his boots cleaned every few days. He's very good to me, always pays me a premium.
   1183847|00000000||Know where I might find him?
   1185532|00000000||No… but you could wait here. Perhaps he'll stop by.
   1185534|00000000||Don't have the time for that… Sure you don't know where to find him? Or, maybe notice which direction he came from?
   1185536|00000000||When I clean boots, sir, I do not look up to see where folk come from. I clean!
   1183835|00000000||No way, not about to contribute to your shady venture.
   1183837|00000000||You'll tell me what you know - for free.
   1183843|00000000||Yes, sir, of course, sir, as you wish, sir…
   1183831|00000000||Not about to pay you.
   1183830|00000000||All right. Let's negotiate…
   1183833|00000000||All right, let's see if we can't figure something out…
   1165661|00000000||Ah! See? I knew we'd clinch it.
   1157578|00000000||Out of the question, quite simply no.
   1165665|00000000||Just one problem… Don't have the coin. See if I can't get some, then come back.
   1165667|00000000||I shall patiently await your return.
   1165663|00000000||Not about to pay.
   1165662|00000000||I'll pay.
   1191981|00000000||Worked so hard I sweat blood, today. Now home, sweet home.
   1186256|00000000||They's acomin'!
   1180152|00000000||Hear that? Your bandits have arrived.
   1180154|00000000||Let us go out to greet them.
   1186249|00000000||Harharhar!
   1180157|00000000||Hark, contemptible curs!
   1180160|00000000||Hahahaha! He mean us?
   1186251|00000000||Heheheh! Regular Punch n' Judy, 'ere!
   1160715|00000000||I, Palmerin de Launfal, call upon you to repent! Search your hearts! Do you not see that they are blackened?!
   1160717|00000000||To prey upon commoners is no honor! To loot their meager stores! Abandon the path of shame and we will spare you!
   1180178|00000000||Right good jest, that. Had us a laugh. Now fuck off, 'fore we lose our patience and you lose somethin' else.
   1180180|00000000||Nay, wait, Zorg. These lads're a lark. Mayhaps they know some tricks?
   1160719|00000000||Oi, players! Can you toss balls, all loopedy-like? Or do that thing where one spits fire while the other farts!
   1180213|00000000||Noble Palmerin's giving you a chance. Now I'm gonna give you some advice - do what he says.
   1180215|00000000||Or what?
   1180217|00000000||Or you'll find yourself fighting knights-errant in the pay of the duchess of Toussaint. And they eat scum like you with their morning porridge.
   1180219|00000000||There's three of 'em. Two turtled up in armor. We'll come back later.
   1180221|00000000||Some wench sent them! Folk'll say we's afeared o' wenches and jesters.
   1180223|00000000||Oooh - insulted the duchess. Not good.
   1180225|00000000||Indeed, we cannot let the affront go unpunished. I swear upon the heron you will pay with your own blood!
   1180227|00000000||By the crane! Villains, ready your arms!
   1180211|00000000||Take my advice - listen to Palmerin.
   1180210|00000000||Seems they won't heed your call.
   1180207|00000000||Seems to me they're unmoved.
   1180209|00000000||You tried, my friend.
   1159675|00000000||We've talked enough! I challenge you all to combat! By my honor! For Toussaint!
   1159723|00000000||For Beauclair! By the crane, defend yourselves, harlotsbroods!
    580019|05b6c5a4||Drunk
   1135492|00000000||So how's the trade these days, master witcher?
   1177566|00000000||Can't complain.
   1177562|00000000||Good for you. 'Cause in our neck o' the woods, things're dark, dark shite.
   1177568|00000000||Wine sales're stuck in the muck and sinkin' deeper. It's the fuckin' wretched names, I tell ye.
   1177564|00000000||Folk outwith the duchy havenae any notion how tae say Cote de Blessure and all that. It twists their tongues in bloody knots. Makes 'em ashamed to ask for it.
   1204763|00000000||In olden times, folk would augur from the manner in which peacocks pecked at grain.
   1204908|00000000||Don't you mean hens?
   1204910|00000000||The common folk used hens, perhaps. Nobles augured from peacocks.
   1204912|00000000||In any case, for those who wish to see their fortune, there's more grain on the table.
   1204761|00000000||If one were to call a State courageous or cowardly, what other part of the State would one have in mind if not that which fights and goes to war on the State's behalf?
   1204887|00000000||No one would ever think of any other.
   1204894|00000000||For the State is courageous in virtue of a portion of itself which preserves the instilled opinion about the nature of things to be feared and not to be feared in pleasure or in pain, under the influence of desire or fear.
   1204896|00000000||Yet how might we relate this to knights?
   1204898|00000000||When Her Grace the Duchess knights a man, she does so to cause him gracefully to follow the laws of the State and of knighthood.
   1204904|00000000||And to do so with a conviction as to what is to be feared and not to be feared, and allow nothing to obscure this conviction - not pleasure, not pain, not desire, not dread.
   1204924|00000000||Fiorano of the 1290 vintage. I do encourage you to try it.
   1204795|00000000||Behold the leopard from far-away Zerrikania. A predator wild, blood-thirsty and ferocious!
   1204923|00000000||Beauty and grace embodied in murderous form! Like nothing else!
   1204926|00000000||A splendid beast!
   1204928|00000000||So fierce!
   1205005|00000000||Let us, my Lady, roll our strength and all<br>Our sweetness up into one ball,
   1205494|00000000||And tear our pleasures with rough strife,<br>Through the iron gates of life.
   1205007|00000000||Words of such beauty, I am transported…
   1205033|00000000||Behold the focused, fearful symmetry!
   1205035|00000000||It has the gaze of the Beast, of that I'm sure.
   1205037|00000000||Focused, fearful symmetry…
   1205020|00000000||Why, the impertinence!
   1205022|00000000||I beg your pardon!
   1205028|00000000||They seem to have lost their appetite.
   1205030|00000000||Such noble birds, the noblest.
   1205032|00000000||They truly do adorn the palace gardens.
   1205039|00000000||True courage is not that which the broad population sees it to be.
   1205024|00000000||A wonderful mind, knowledge so deep!
   1205026|00000000||I must say I feel quite enriched and enlightened.
   1205331|00000000||You'd like a taste, perhaps? Est Est, an old vintage.
   1205333|00000000||An excellent wine, the excellent selection of His Excellency Ambassador von Hinn. Please help yourselves!
   1205335|00000000||A thoroughbred Cabernet from the legendary 1288 vintage. You must try it.
   1205325|00000000||Smoky accents of marked intensity, adorned with the aromas of an array of jams.
   1205329|00000000||A great wine. With notes of tree bark and detritus, possessing distinct smoky accents. Essential to try.
   1205377|00000000||They seem to like his seeds.
   1205381|00000000||I wonder what a soothsayer would say to that?
   1205379|00000000||It seems an ill omen to me.
   1205327|00000000||The flavor is strongly peppery, enhanced upon the tongue by clear chocolate and cherry notes.
   1208522|09870e00||Colossus
   1164920|00000000||It's grown rather late. I believe we'll be on our way…
   1162556|00000000||Le Papillon? Lebioda's wounds! You saved me, at the last second!
   1162558|00000000||You're welcome. Jean-Louis Ludovic, I presume. Let's get out of here before he--
   1162571|00000000||Quiet, both of you! I've got it!
   1105469|00000000||They froze in their fear, the knight's henchmen and squires, while his bowels set loose, heavenward spiraled.
   1105473|00000000||The witcher cleft him, in two lacerated, his next swing the swine adroitly castrated.
   1105480|00000000||With one more caress from the witcher's blade, the knight's gut plopped out, his breakfast betrayed.
   1105502|00000000||Then he hobbled apace, on his stump arms like crutches, all for the glory of Her Grace, the Duchess!
   1105542|00000000||What about my pay?
   1105526|00000000||Think you got a bit confused.
   1105543|00000000||Think you got confused. Sure you saw all that?
   1178534|00000000||Forgive me, witcher, but poetry's hardly your forte. In fact, you know squat. Today's audiences demand high drama, and I provide it.
   1105547|00000000||What about my pay?
   1105550|00000000||I've decided you should receive a reasonable share of the royalties. Payable, let us say… semi-annually?
   1105585|00000000||Meaning you're broke just now.
   1105587|00000000||Ahem. I owe you a thousand thanks, master witcher. I-I'll gladly pay your reward. Not to mention trimming you when you see the need and come by.
   1153104|00000000||Hm. Thanks. Take care, now.
   1105528|00000000||Bravo. Almost believed you were there.
   1178532|00000000||Doesn't it seem so? At last, Master Dandelion has a worthy competitor!
   1105525|00000000||Bravo.
   1105500|00000000||Then he hobbled apace, on his stump arms like crutches, all for the glory of Her Grace, the Duchess!
   1163634|cc375a5e||Innkeep
   1106131|00000000||While trekking across picturesque Toussaint, Geralt happened on the highly unusual Ardaiso Quarry. It appeared out of the ordinary as it seemed filled with the pieces of some mammoth statue, all hewn straight from the quarry's rock. Geralt arrived at the quarry to witness an argument between a group of workers and their foreman. He learned that the night before the quarry had been attacked by a falling… cow, which in crashing to the ground had crushed one of the quarry workers. The worker's colleagues had understandably insisted that they would not resume their labors until the matter was resolved. The witcher, as befits a professional of his caliber, agreed to look into the mystery.<br>
   1190053|00000000||Having slain the two slyzards, Geralt also incinerated the nest full of slyzard eggs. For as the locals proclaim, "Lebioda helps those who help themselves."<br>
   1180993|00000000||Upon inspecting the cow's carcass and the worker's corpse, Geralt established that no plague  had caused the incident (as the quarry workers had vehemently claimed), nor was it the result of a distorted portal (as Geralt himself had suspected). Instead, the witcher discovered the cause to be relatively banal. A draconid had been carrying the cow back to its nest. Yet the beast had either lost its grip of overestimated its strength, and the cow had landed in the quarry - and in doing so had crushed one of the workers.<br>
   1106132|00000000||With his hunt done, the witcher informed the quarry workers that he had removed the threat - said threat having been no more than a juvenile slyzard. The foreman breathed a sigh of relief, for his crew could get back to its job - erecting a gigantic statue of the Prophet Lebioda.<br>
   1190055|00000000||The witcher, an expert in all matters monstrous, was quick to divine that the draconid he sought was a slyzard. All signs seemed to suggest it was a relatively young specimen, that had not only lost its quarry but also been heavily wounded as it accidentally destroyed one of the cranes standing in the quarry. The wound meant the witcher could track the beast easily. He found it quickly, following the trail of its blood. Along the way it turned out the young slyzard's mother had come to help it. Unmoved by this evidence of affection between the beasts, admittedly rare among reptiles in general, Geralt reached the monsters' nest and slew them all.<br>
   1201937|00000000||As a well-known rhetorician once put it, one touched by bad luck is liable to break his finger while attempting to clear a nostril. The witcher, in passing through the Ardaiso Quarry, happened on a worker who had been crushed by a cow when it fell on him! Intrigued by the circumstances by which this had come to pass, He resolved to ask around about the details of the incident.<br>
   1201938|00000000||A witcher's life is never dull. If there ever comes a point when he's had his fill of cockatrices, strigas or nekkers, he can always count on the world throwing something unusual in his Path. As was the case on this occasion, when a bovine crashed to the ground from the sky, landing right on top of a quarry worker! At last, here was a contract that would surely tear the witcher free of the fetters of the quotidian that so often held him!<br>
   1092757|00000000||Find the quarry foreman.
   1092759|00000000||Examine the cow carcass and the workman's body.
   1170191|00000000||Collect a reward for solving the cow mystery.
   1201651|00000000||Use your Witcher Senses to investigate how the crane was damaged.

   1092764|00000000||[Optional] Destroy the nest and the slyzard eggs.
   1092729|00000000||Contract: Bovine Blues
   1164587|00000000||Oh, boy. Another one.
   1182003|00000000||What's that? Another what?
   1182005|00000000||Did Madame Isabelle mention role-playing cost extra? If you wish to play at being a witcher, then…
   1182007|00000000||Misunderstanding, I'm afraid. I am a witcher.
   1182009|00000000||Of course, the eyes… I should have noticed. Forgive me, master… Come into my alcove. I shall more than make up for my error there.
   1164585|00000000||Me again. Real-life witcher.
   1164598|00000000||Let's go upstairs.
   1182016|00000000||Come.
   1164591|00000000||Let's go upstairs.
   1164596|00000000||Sorry. Gotta go.
   1164592|00000000||Sorry… gotta go.
   1164590|00000000||The role-playing, as a witcher - what's that about?
   1164594|00000000||The, uh… playing at being a witcher thing - what's that about?
   1182022|00000000||It's the latest rage. A trick will come, dressed in a studded jacket, two swords on his back - and ask me to play a succubus or a siren.
   1182024|00000000||Then he'll say he has a contract, but his codex says he cannot harm a thinking being, so perhaps we can make a deal…. Once it's over, he demands some kind of card. I've no notion how it started… They probably took the idea from one of those silly ballads.
   1182026|00000000||Mhm. Got a strong suspicion who the author might be.
   1164589|00000000||You've come back. They always come back for me.
   1164600|00000000||Oh. You're pretty.
   1182028|00000000||Get paid to say that.
   1182030|00000000||I get paid to plough. Compliments I give only when the urge strikes me.
   1182032|00000000||So, willing to show me if your birthday suit is equally becoming?
   1164602|00000000||Mind made up?
   1164612|00000000||Let's go somewhere secluded. Hm?
   1164604|00000000||Whaddaya say we find a secluded corner somewhere?
   1164610|00000000||Be back later.
   1182051|00000000||Hold you to that.
   1164605|00000000||I'll come back later.
   1164603|00000000||You're pretty direct…
   1164721|00000000||Don't beat around the bush, do you.
   1164723|00000000||I dislike pretending to be someone I am not. All the sighs, fainting, fluttering eyelashes… it's just not me.
   1182058|00000000||I operate on the assumption that if a man seeks coyness, he does not go to a brothel.
   1182060|00000000||Right about that. Definitely had something else in mind.
   1182062|00000000||Then come and show me.
   1182049|00000000||Well, well. My favorite swordsman.
   1182092|00000000||Shhh.
   1182094|00000000||You needn't apologize. You needn't worry about a thing. You've come to enjoy some pleasant moments. To rest. To relax.
   1182096|00000000||Let me help you do just that.
   1164845|00000000||Changed your mind…?
   1164620|00000000||Take me to your room?
   1182098|00000000||With pleasure.
   1164607|00000000||Take me to your room.
   1164618|00000000||Sorry… gotta go.
   1164608|00000000||Gotta go.
   1164606|00000000||Tell me about yourself.
   1164622|00000000||Tell me a bit about yourself.
   1164624|00000000||My name is Madeleine. I like to walk barefoot in the grass, read by candlelight and drink young wine straight from the bottle.
   1164626|00000000||You're sweet.
   1182100|00000000||Don't let appearances fool you. Hmhm…
   1164847|00000000||Nice to see you again, Geralt.
   1179768|00000000||Do you wish to practice fighting a moment longer?
   1132283|00000000||I expected you to do well, but not that well.
   1132285|00000000||Do you wish to train more?
   1132292|00000000||Will you fight again?
   1145772|00000000||Remember, you will lose should you wander outside the arena.
   1179766|00000000||So, have you had enough? Or do you wish to ride again?
   1133249|00000000||Will you give it another go? I can set out more dummies.
   1133347|00000000||No harm in going again. Practice makes perfect, even for witchers.
   1133250|00000000||I'll give it another go.
   1133349|00000000||Come back to this later.
   1133252|00000000||Maybe later.
   1133251|00000000||I've had enough.
   1132307|00000000||Had enough. Rather not wear my horse down before the real race.
   1132145|00000000||Once more?
   1132149|00000000||Gladly give it another try.
   1132146|00000000||Be glad to do some shooting.
   1132235|00000000||We'll practice some more later.
   1132233|00000000||We'll train some more later.
   1132147|00000000||That's enough.
   1132151|00000000||Done enough shooting.
   1132160|00000000||Where to now?
   1206030|00000000||If you wish to know my thoughts, were I you I would train on the race course ahead of all else.
   1132164|00000000||Let's do some riding. Roach'll like that.
   1194568|00000000||Excellent idea.
   1134661|00000000||All right. Horsemanship training.
   1132166|00000000||Be nice to swing, do some footwork, work up a sweat.
   1194714|00000000||Very well. We shall practice infantry combat, one on one. Each knight opts for his own method. Rainfarn, for instance, fights halberd in hand.
   1134662|00000000||Combat training.
   1132168|00000000||Time for some target practice, I think.
   1134663|00000000||Marksmanship training.
   1137712|00000000||Trained enough for now.
   1137714|00000000||Ah, trained enough, I think. High time we saw to your Vivienne.
   1156813|00000000||She is not mine. Not yet.
   1132162|00000000||Now you must go to the inscription tent. Honor and glory are all true and good, but your scrolls must be in order.
   1132290|00000000||Think I've seen enough. Sorry to be blunt, but the simplest witcher contract demands more skill than this kind of combat.
   1172989|00000000||Practiced this enough.
   1134674|00000000||Had enough for now. Come back to this later, maybe.
   1172990|00000000||We'll come back to this later.
   1172988|00000000||Wanna fight.
   1146343|00000000||Could probably use some more practice. Usually fight monsters, not knights.
   1134702|00000000||Wrong target! One point for your opponent!
   1132174|00000000||You will team with other knights to fight. The clash simulates a true skirmish during battle.
   1132176|00000000||Come the end, you shall fight a duel. It will determine your place on the podium.
   1135077|00000000||I always liked the duels the best… but now I can think only of my Vivienne. In the end, it is good you will replace me. I sense I would simply be distracted this time.
   1132203|00000000||For honor! Sir, we shall cross swords if you'll allow it!
   1132228|00000000||You need not ask me twice!
   1132230|00000000||I will stand and fight. But be warned, I do nothing half-way!
   1132232|00000000||You wish to spar? Why not.
   1133923|00000000||The knights' codex commands constant improvement.
   1132226|00000000||I can fight.
   1132141|00000000||Hit the red targets!
   1132170|00000000||Come with me.
   1145842|00000000||Sirs, there will be a new entrant in the tourney. He wishes to duel one of you, to warm his muscles.
   1194653|00000000||Who shall challenge him?
   1132182|00000000||I've always believed there is nothing quite like a duel to get one's blood coursing.
   1132301|00000000||The tourney's race differs from others you might have taken part in. You shall not ride against any opponent.
   1188517|00000000||How's it a race at all ,then?
   1156721|00000000||It's a race against time! The true track begins in the arena, runs round the tourney grounds, then finishes again in the arena.
   1173112|00000000||The training track, however, lies beyond the arena. We shall go there now.
   1170496|00000000||Stand at the center of the training ground. A knight will approach and challenge you.
   1180976|00000000||Do descend from your horse, Geralt. This is unmounted combat.
   1133341|00000000||All is ready! Now listen, for it can be quite the challenge. Along your route stand dummies and targets. The dummies you may cut with your blade, the targets you must hit from your crossbow.
   1173301|00000000||The time you have to complete the course shall increase each time you land a strike, be it with blade or bolt. It may sound simple enough, yet I've seen many a knight fail this contest and hang his head in shame.
   1173303|00000000||During the race proper, judges throughout the course shall tally your points. For now, you may ride unperturbed by those matters.
   1132131|00000000||The marksmanship contest shall pit you against another for the best time and score.
   1156802|00000000||He who hits all his targets first wins.
   1173306|00000000||Hope my aim's as good as that cupid's who shot you.
   1173308|00000000||Sometimes when you speak, I miss the meaning entirely.
   1167173|00000000||Do you know where this leads?
   1169794|00000000||No. Hope it's the exit, though.
   1167175|00000000||You guessed it. The thing is, there are different kinds of exits.
   1167177|00000000||Some walk this path to freedom… Others walk it straight into eternity.
   1177720|00000000||Which'm I headed for?
   1167179|00000000||I don't know. Yet one thing is certain - you will never walk this path again.
   1150275|00000000||Where're you going? You're to stay close.
   1189994|00000000||Now I shaw sway you, fiend! Fow my wady wuff! Fow honow!
   1194901|00000000||For… a knoll?
   1194903|00000000||HONOW! Don't petwend you don't undastand, poo-bwains!
   1194905|00000000||Watch what you say! Knights errant never swear!
   1194907|00000000||And fouw bandits don't mock knights - they cowah in feaw and beg! En gawde!
   1049948|d360277a||Messenger
   1198469|00000000||Geralt of Rivia, every man in the duchy is your debtor!
   1198471|00000000||I cannot believe you managed to disperse Filibert Fourfingers' hanse! Good on you, sir!
   1190523|00000000||Has anyone ever won a battle with words?
   1190521|00000000||The quill mightier than the sword? Pff… Only if the sword is very short and the quill very sharp.
   1190529|00000000||Let us dance, Snow White!
   1190527|00000000||When two quarrel, a third should keep out of it!
   1190525|00000000||You find it hard to keep up?
   1190531|00000000||Mhm. You've my attention, sir.
   1190533|00000000||Oh, yes. Humblest regards.
   1190535|00000000||Whoa, cool your boots, hotspur!
   1144421|00000000||Stocks and the whip await those running riot! Our duchy values peace and quiet!
   1144435|00000000||Come, now, keep calm!
   1181043|b55017da||Gaston
   1194462|00000000||That what now?
   1194464|00000000||Blimey!
   1194466|00000000||*Sighs* 'Nough said.
   1194468|00000000||Hey!
   1194470|00000000||Shit, shit, shit.
   1194472|00000000||Noooo!
   1188878|00000000||Something dark happened here. Very dark.
   1200913|00000000||This man is dying…! Help me!
   1200915|00000000||What's going on?!
   1181065|00000000||The dressings, bandages… where did I put them?
   1182118|00000000||Forget it. Bandages won't do him any good.
   1182120|00000000||What? But… he breathed still a moment ago.
   1183868|00000000||Mhm. Breathed his last, then. Bled to death. Leg's broken, femoral artery's ruptured. Wound like that, you're dead in minutes.
   1183870|00000000||Gods…
   1183872|00000000||What happened here, exactly?
   1183874|00000000||I… I was rolling through, fully loaded, when I heard screams. This one crawled towards the road, then drooped to the ground, lost consciousness. I jumped down to help him, dress his wounds. Then you appeared.
   1182137|00000000||Stand and step away from him.
   1182139|00000000||What? Me? But… what is your grief?
   1182141|00000000||Don't make me say it again. That's good advice.
   1183892|00000000||Will you tell me what it is you seek?
   1183894|00000000||Needed to see if you were lying.
   1183896|00000000||You'd be covered in blood if you'd dealt those wounds. Just got it on your hands, though. So all's in order.
   1183883|00000000||All sounds fishy.
   1183882|00000000||Helping a stranger - admirable.
   1182125|00000000||Pretty admirable, stopping to help a stranger.
   1182127|00000000||Truthfully? When I saw him, I considered it might be an ambush - the thought entered my mind. I near decided to crack the whip… But to abandon a man in need? It's simply not the decent thing to do.
   1182129|00000000||Decent enough in many other places. Believe me.
   1182133|00000000||Before you go on, clean your hands thoroughly, and burn your shirt. Might also wanna rub some thyme on your body, to be sure. Smell of blood might attract ghouls otherwise.
   1183900|00000000||Who… who might you be, precisely?
   1183902|00000000||A witcher.
   1183904|00000000||Ah, gulp, uh-huh. Do you expect some… some beast might have killed him?
   1188905|00000000||So… what will it be? Aim to see what's occurred after all?
   1182222|00000000||Could be… Not really my concern, though. Never work for free.
   1182224|00000000||I see… Farewell to you, then.
   1183906|00000000||Not my concern. Farewell.
   1183905|00000000||Plan to figure that out.
   1182218|00000000||See what we have here… Leg's broken, but cause of death's the wound. Small but deep, edges unfrayed.
   1201502|00000000||Either a thrust weapon or a thick claw, maybe a wyvern's. Tough to say, and…
   1187705|00000000||Hm. Breastplate's unusual. Dented… and it's got a patina.
   1182220|00000000||An antiquity, I believe… I deal in these things, so… What's puzzling is… why did he don it?
   1183935|00000000||Not likely to learn that from him.
   1182320|00000000||Might even know where he came from… Got work to do, so… so long.
   1182186|00000000||Now to figure out where he came from. From that house, I'm assuming, but need to investigate. Got some work to do, so… so long.
   1183938|00000000||Wait! I will come with you!
   1183940|00000000||Gotta be kidding.
   1183962|00000000||Gotta be kidding. This isn't a garden romp. Whatever killed him's damn dangerous and--
   1183964|00000000||And it might still prowl the area. So, if it's all the same, I'd prefer to accompany you!
   1183960|00000000||Hm. So be it. But stay close, keep it down, and don't touch a thing.
   1183939|00000000||Fine. Let's go.
   1188880|00000000||Hey! Heeey!! Do not dare leave me here alone!
   1188876|00000000||He tried to crawl away, though he was heavily wounded. Something horrifying must have been after him.
   1196704|00000000||Here our paths diverge.
   1196805|00000000||Ooph… I'd begun to think you'd not return. It seems to me the man on the highroad, he crawled there from here.
   1214469|00000000||The dressings, bandages…
   1189060|00000000||Mickey, mackey, mockey, here lived elder folky!
   1195341|00000000||Their ears were tipped like spades! Their teeth were sharp as blades!
   1195343|00000000||Then King Ludovic came along… And they vanished right anon.
   1195345|00000000||Mickey, mackey, mockey, gone are the elder folky!
   1105050|00000000||Hold! I say, is that Geralt? Geralt of Rivia? Sir! Come to me, please! Approach!
   1207652|00000000||Away! Away, beast!
   1207654|00000000||Let me be!
   1207650|00000000||You will not catch me!
   1186496|00000000||Poor man. A horrid death, truly…
   1171141|00000000||Who are you? Fess up.
   1171151|00000000||Who exactly are you? And how'd you develop such an interest in the beast?
   1171153|00000000||Count Borhis - happy to be of service. As to the beast, well, this subspecies is our dynastic symbol. The di Salvaresses have for centuries signed with the Regulus Platinum.
   1171155|00000000||As family legend has it, a female of the species rescued an ancestor, a boy at the time, from a burning building. She took the tyke back to her nest, where she fed him as if he were one of her own youngsters.
   1172807|00000000||Malarkey.
   1172832|00000000||To be sure. But beautiful malarkey it is.
   1171142|00000000||Families of the victims - you pay them off?
   1172272|00000000||Hm. Pay the victims' families compensation? Why?
   1172274|00000000||These lands have been my family's for decades, granted to us by Duchess Ademarta. Beyond them, the basilisk ventures not, hunts not, it does not kill or destroy.
   1172700|00000000||Provided it is not provoked. Yet if it does destroy, if it kills, I compensate all for their loss. From my own coffers.
   1172702|00000000||Huh. Your coffers. Got a store of sons and husbands in there, to compensate for those shredded by your beast?
   1172704|00000000||Naturally, I cannot revive the dead… But I do make generous restitution to their loved ones. Just last summer, I paid a leather tooler's widow eight hundred crowns.
   1175529|00000000||This unfortunate merchant's family - to be duly indemnified as well.
   1171135|00000000||Area's dangerous. I'd say there's a basilisk nesting around here. You'd be wise to remain at some distance.
   1171137|00000000||Yes, I'm familiar with the matter. And quite proud to say a basilisk does nest here! I look after it, personally!
   1172260|00000000||Look after it? It's not exactly a pet. Beast's murdering folk who come through here.
   1172268|00000000||Just a minute. It does not murder those who do not trespass upon its territory.
   1187800|00000000||I posted a number of signs! Warnings! Specifically to prevent anyone from coming to any harm!
   1186486|00000000||You post those warnings?
   1187798|00000000||Indeed. To prevent anyone from coming to any harm.
   1187802|00000000||Well, a lot of good they did. Got a freshly mangled corpse right here.
   1187804|00000000||Most likely a merchant, the poor bloke. Just today I learned two traders had chosen this route despite the signs. I came as quick as I could to warn them. Too late, alas…
   1187806|00000000||I've instructed my servants. They shall take the body, return it to the family with a generous sum as recompense.
   1171161|00000000||Where's the basilisk nesting, any idea?
   1171163|00000000||Of course I've an idea. But you don't really expect me to tell you. Those are not toy swords, I know your intentions.
   1172992|00000000||Find it myself, then. Easy to track with its distinct paw prints. Mentioned two merchants, so I might also look for the other corpse.
   1171143|00000000||Basilisk - know where I might find it?
   1171140|00000000||Claim this is the last surviving basilisk? Plan to stick to that story?
   1171147|00000000||Claim this to be the last surviving basilisk? How do you figure?
   1171149|00000000||The last of this subspecies. Their population was much larger at one time, see, before the beech forests were felled.
   1183823|00000000||Mean to suggest a direct correlation between beechwood forest density and basilisk populations?
   1183825|00000000||Indirect, I'd prefer to contend. Beechwood forests are the chief habitat of roe deer, you see, in turn a staple of the basilisk diet.
   1183827|00000000||When roe deer grew scarce, basilisks made humans their staple food. Enter the witchers.
   1172604|00000000||And thus we've come to this one, last specimen. It's a female. As recently as last year, we still had two. But Iocaste's mate passed on, alas.
   1175602|00000000||Iocaste?
   1175604|00000000||Should she not have a name? My father dubbed her, in honor of my dear departed mother. Iocaste was brooding then - two eggs. That she cast from her nest, alas, when the male perished.
   1154392|00000000||Oh, no, yet another fugitive from the North. Why are you here?
   1207799|00000000||Don't know if you noticed, but I just saved your ass.
   1207801|00000000||Yes, yes, though not without a reward in mind, I wager. I know your kind.
   1185684|00000000||Course. And I'll want a share of your beggars' alms, too. Wanted to take a look at your goods first. May I?
   1185686|00000000||Hrmph. I suppose… but you're to touch nothing and on purchasing pay in full in hard currency. Understood?
   1185687|00000000||Northerners - whaddaya got against them?
   1185695|00000000||Nordlings - what about them bothers you so much?
   1185697|00000000||Apart from the fact they are all thieves, liars and layabouts? Not a thing.
   1154402|00000000||Like you to craft something for me. I'll pay, of course.
   1154396|00000000||Want you to craft something for me.
   1154408|00000000||Gotta go. So long.
   1154398|00000000||Farewell.
   1154395|00000000||What're you selling?
   1154400|00000000||Show me your wares. Promise not to touch anything.
   1154394|00000000||What do you seek here? Go back, Nord-ding, across the Yaruga! Go home!
   1193350|00000000||Bloody scram.
   1193352|00000000||Leave me be.
   1193354|00000000||I'm not drunkh.
   1193356|00000000||Run! Leg it!
   1191956|00000000||Ehhh, you… I dunno… Huh?
   1191959|00000000||Buuuuurrrp… Akh akh.
   1179194|00000000||Snails… I could slurp a barrelful.
   1179196|00000000||Never you fear! We shall soon tan your hide!
   1179192|00000000||Bum-smacking on an empty stomach! I despise it!

   1183966|00000000||Traversing the fairytale duchy of Toussaint, Geralt came upon a gang of degenerate scoundrels. Unhappy with their lot in life, they promptly ran at him, then enthusiastically skewered themselves on his sword. The witcher searched their camp and found some interesting notes…<br>
   1183967|00000000||From these he learned of an ill-fated traveler, a nobleman from Caravista, one Conrad Veidt. Veidt had bet his friends he could traverse the entire Continent in just eighty days! Alas, his journey ended after just eight days, in Toussaint, where his wagon, loaded with supplies to last the entire trek, wound up at the bottom of a lake.<br>
   1183968|00000000||Geralt decided to find the wagon once belonging to Veidt, an adventurer who had fallen prey to highway robbers. The witcher, too, was a traveler and explorer. As such he knew a planned voyage of this sort required the one undertaking it to prepare for all eventualities. This included carrying valuables. So he found the site of the traveler's demise, where he dispatched another gang of bandits seeking to nab the adventurer's load. Then lickety-split he dove in and picked the sunken wagon clean of all things precious.<br>
   1183969|00000000||Read the bandit's notes.
   1183970|00000000||Find the sunken wagon in the lake.
   1183965|00000000||Around the World in… Eight Days
   1207163|47fff475||Loth Halfbreed
   1171786|00000000||You're all nincompoops, the whole lot!
   1171784|00000000||All this really gets my goat!
   1171790|00000000||You can all go suck an egg!
   1171788|00000000||Your mum stinks of porridge.
   1201490|00000000||Butcher of Blaviken's a fine wine, but it's got a bite like none other the next morn!
   1196168|00000000||Come, now. That is clearly rubbish.
   1196170|00000000||I don't know… It might be true, it might not be.
   1183747|00000000||Her Grace's sister was behind the murders… Now that is basis for a ballad!
   1183749|00000000||Oh, a truly happy ending! Long live the duchess! Long live witcher Geralt!
   1183743|00000000||The famed witcher from the North!
   1183745|00000000||Seek shelter, ladies, the witcher's on the prowl!
   1183757|00000000||I'm, hm, something like sleepy… Nostalgic… No, more at pensive…
   1183751|00000000||Hey there, old chap!
   1183753|00000000||Hayseed dung smearer!
   1196176|00000000||Have you heard? That barbarous witcher from the North defeated the Maestro at fisticuffs!
   1196174|00000000||The word is some tarts outside town began to play at summoning spirits. They actually managed to summon a wraith and… wham-bam! Gone in seconds, all of them!
   1196172|00000000||Our knights - so immaculately virtuous, yet two brawled over a girl at the Belles! They ripped each other's chest hair out, they say. Clearly, they were bereft of their armor at the time.
   1183755|00000000||Whoa, have you made my virtue your quarry?!
   1152296|00000000||Hold, master! A beast lurks in there!
   1168364|00000000||Right, expected as much, 'cause I--
   1168366|00000000||Tshshshsh! Quiet, before you wake it! Come, I've camped nearby. We shall talk there.
   1152310|00000000||What do they call you? What's your crest? Speak!
   1151645|00000000||Zzzzzzz…
   1151647|00000000||Ahem.
   1152289|00000000||Huh? Ooph… You scared me half to death, drifter!
   1168362|00000000||Geralt, just Geralt.
   1105873|00000000||Name's Geralt. No crest, no motto, no plumed helmet, even. I'm a witcher.
   1168372|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. Crest of the Bridge. Hail and well met.
   1105858|00000000||Call me Geralt of Rivia.
   1105859|00000000||Ravix of Fourhorn.
   1152251|00000000||Ravix of Fourhorn. My crest shows a maiden sitting astride a… striding bear.
   1152293|00000000||So, now that we've had our knight-to-knight chat…
   1152304|00000000||Takes two weeks, that?
   1193548|00000000||You still here?
   1193627|00000000||I… I was about to forge forth…
   1152325|00000000||Wouldn't happen to need any help, would you?
   1152327|00000000||Hm, I-I don't know… After all, I did swear a solemn oath to…
   1152329|00000000||Deposit the beast's head at your beloved's feet. No mention of you killing it all by yourself, though.
   1152331|00000000||Hm… all in all… I suppose you are right! Whew… We must fight side by side, then! For honor!
   1101890|00000000||Maybe I can help?
   1193640|00000000||Dammit… Should follow the guy. Least I'll be able to tell the fiancée what happened.
   1101959|00000000||Leave you to it, then.
   1101961|00000000||Ahem… Right. Onward.
   1105887|00000000||For hoooonoooooor!!!
   1101957|00000000||Don't let me get in your way.
   1193546|00000000||Be willing to help you… just not this instant.
   1193544|00000000||Could help you… just not now.
   1152308|00000000||I have tarried a bit, true. But the delay is done! My word I gave, thus the beast shall die!
   1152302|00000000||Mh, by napping outside the cave? For a fortnight?
   1152298|00000000||François le Goff, I presume. Your betrothed sent me. See, you've been gone a while, so you've got her worried.
   1152300|00000000||I-- Well, indeed, for… for Grottore is a most fearsome beast! I must prepare properly for battle!
   1151649|00000000||Mind telling me why you're here?
   1151651|00000000||For the head of Grottore, the monster from yon cave. I swore on my honor I would bring it to my betrothed, mounted on a pike.
   1152318|00000000||Mhm. Made any progress?
   1152320|00000000||I've… mh-hmm… been gathering my strength. I shall attack soon. I gave my word, and my word is my honor!
   1174977|00000000||Grrr… I've one massive bee in my bonnet today!
   1174975|00000000||Witcher! The hanses - destroy them!
   1174979|00000000||You seek something? I've got it!
   1174981|00000000||Taxes, schmaxes, scurvy hanses… How is a man to live?
   1184702|00000000||Ehh… the meter's all off. Once again.
   1184704|00000000||One, two, three… there's the misstep. I'm a syllable short.
   1184708|00000000||Go pester someone more patient!
   1184706|00000000||Leave me be. I'm trying to work.
   1197245|00000000||Never suspected you believed in such things.
   1197887|00000000||Fine, let's give it a try…
   1197239|00000000||Look, lanterns! They say releasing them brings good luck.
   1182628|877e029a||Sculptor
   1156307|00000000||All right, let's look around.
   1156370|00000000||Tunnels - not the work of kikimores, that's certain. Too big for any insectoid.
   1150941|00000000||Shattered dishes. Got knocked off the shelf somehow…Shaken off, maybe…?
   1159298|00000000||Getting more interesting by the minute.
   1147976|00000000||Water coursing. Underground stream?
   1152060|00000000||A kikimore nest… Completely destroyed. Monster I'm looking for must eat them.
   1156646|00000000||Where's this go?
   1153208|00000000||Should be able to break through.
   1147972|00000000||Cracked kikimore eggs. Something's been feeding on them.
   1168611|00000000||Hmmm… monster I'm looking for lives underground, digs tunnels, feeds on kikimores… and is big. Very big.
   1197296|00000000||Won't learn anything else here. Time to go back to the surface.
   1169042|00000000||Kikimores?
   1147937|00000000||Dammit! It's getting away!
   1147974|00000000||No kikimore dug this. Tunnels're the work of something much bigger… Something with heavy, wide claws.
   1150877|00000000||Rats. Not known to kidnap farmhands.
   1196486|00000000||It's quiet… Guess the monster actually is nocturnal. Gotta wait till dark.
   1104770|00000000||Wall almost collapsed.
   1104841|00000000||A tunnel? Hmm…
   1104609|00000000||What the--?!
   1153197|00000000||Goes on and on, this tunnel.
   1184855|00000000||My gran will be hopping mad if I don't go home right away.
   1184853|00000000||One, two, three… My gran sees me! Hahaha!
   1172947|00000000||The Prophet Lebioda watch over us all.
   1172945|00000000||The duquessa summoning witchers - end times, indeed.
   1172949|00000000||I'd prefer you didn't pester me.
   1172951|00000000||I've no time for you.
   1194028|00000000||Greetings!
   1194030|00000000||How are you faring?
   1194032|00000000||Watch where you step!
   1194036|00000000||Save yourselves!
   1194038|00000000||Help!
   1184294|00000000||Watch out! Pixies!
   1165125|00000000||Oh, Geralt, Geralt… and they call me cruel.
   1197266|00000000||Will-o'-the-wisp… Think it's got something to show us.
   1197268|00000000||Careful. It is not to be trusted.
   1165991|00000000||You stepped on Thumbelina! That was my favorite tale!
   1166141|00000000||Hm… why's that?
   1166151|00000000||Because it wasn't about a princess. Tales about princesses are insufferable.
   1165989|00000000||Hey! Watch it!
   1157480|00000000||Dammit… And this is a playground for two little girls? Something's not right.
   1164628|00000000||Eye of Nehaleni's going wild… Whole land's an illusion, but so powerful there's no way to dispel it.
   1165945|00000000||Recognize it? Once upon a time, a terrible dragon attacked Vizima. It took a clever young cobbler to bring about its defeat.
   1165947|00000000||Right. Every now and again some village idiot tries to imitate him… and I gotta come in to clean up the mess.
   1160059|00000000||Exciting, isn't it?! Reminds me of my childhood!
   1160061|00000000||Reminds me of something altogether different!
   1162388|00000000||Care to elaborate?!
   1162390|00000000||Rather not!
   1162409|00000000||So… what exactly is happening in the city?
   1162411|00000000||Bloodshed, a massacre. Which is why we gotta hurry.
   1162413|00000000||You needn't fret. Time flows differently in the Fablesphere. We can stay here a week, yet outside mere minutes will have passed.
   1165586|00000000||Oh, look! The Emperor of Nilfgaard! He's come out to show off his new robe.
   1164322|00000000||Incredible… You must have loved this place.
   1164418|00000000||I did, at first. But children get bored quickly. Even tea parties with a whole cackle of princesses eventually turn dull and routine.
   1164420|00000000||What'd you do then?
   1164422|00000000||Dropped a duck egg in the swans' nest once. That sort of thing. Stole the pea out from under the princess, who sleeps to this day, I think.
   1197270|00000000||Another will-o'-the-wisp…
   1166067|00000000||No bean here… Gotta keep looking.
   1157478|00000000||Blonde curls… Rest of the body's too mutilated, hard to say anything.
   1164392|00000000||She got what she deserved, as I see it. Always took what she wanted without asking.
   1165986|00000000||Damned territorial, those fur balls… Ptooey!
   1159935|00000000||Oh! Unicorns! We must catch them! We won't have to walk everywhere then.
   1162385|00000000||I call the pink one!
   1207833|00000000||Knight's strange. Doesn't look like he's out of any fairytale I know. Wonder how he got here.
   1207835|00000000||In past times, Anarietta and I would occasionally run into them here. You see, knights errant far outnumber princesses in the real world, so some knights would sneak into the playroom, then into this land. In search of their fairytale damsels, that's all.
   1207886|00000000||Only to be shredded to bits by a swarm of pixies… Irony's delicious.
   1184296|00000000||Not the friendliest pixies I've met.
   1184298|00000000||They were put here to protect the Fablesphere from intruders. Meaning you.
   1162401|00000000||Faster! Come on, you… you…! Know what?! They need names!
   1162403|00000000||I'll call mine… hm… Anise!
   1162405|00000000||Call mine Roach!
   1162407|00000000||Roach?! Are you serious?! Ugh…
   1157476|00000000||Three bears…
   1164269|00000000||Three stools, three beds, three bowls…
   1164390|00000000||One a bit too big, the other too small, the third just right.
   1165949|00000000||Just one thing in its gut - a half-digested sheep… stuffed with tar and sulfur. Of course.
   1166059|00000000||But no bean.
   1166061|00000000||Does that not disgust you? Poking about in a rotting corpse?
   1166063|00000000||Compared to the time I fought a zeugl in Vizima's sewers, this…
   1166150|00000000||Ah, never mind. Don't feel like telling that story again.
   1159501|00000000||A bridge… red pepper underneath? Hm.
   1183992|00000000||Harlot-bred vandal! Get him!
   1162439|00000000||Just curious - why'd you want the Heart of Toussaint? And the ducal wine?
   1162441|00000000||They were my right. My due.
   1162443|00000000||Doubt we would've figured you out if you hadn't tried to get them. Know that, don't you?
   1162445|00000000||I do… and I regret nothing. One lives but once.
   1164324|00000000||Did you like Anna Henrietta?
   1164447|00000000||Do you jest? I adored her. My darling little sis. So adorable! So sweet!
   1164449|00000000||Yet when they banished me from the palace… she didn't so much as peek out of the window.
   1164451|00000000||She might not have known. Maybe just couldn't.
   1164453|00000000||And could she also not grant me amnesty once she was crowned? Please.
   1166293|00000000||Whoa. That should be interesting.
   1166089|00000000||Quite the view, wouldn't you say?
   1162421|00000000||So, do you like it here?
   1162427|00000000||No. Got a problem with magic in general - illusions, portals, all that. Don't trust any of it.
   1162429|00000000||A beau of old-fashioned tastes, eh? I like that.
   1164271|00000000||Four animals stacked atop each other… What was the tale called again?
   1164394|00000000||"The Musicians of Blaviken." Huh… you've some link to the town as well, don't you?
   1164396|00000000||Mhm. But my tale's not much like this one.
   1162638|00000000||My new attire reveals itself but to the wise and cultivated!
   1162636|00000000||Such exquisite robes the world's never seen!
   1162640|00000000||Stunning, are they not? My new robes? Absolutely stunning!
   1164326|00000000||Did you really travel all the way here for a contract?
   1164456|00000000||Nature of the job.
   1164458|00000000||I don't believe it. You must have had another reason.
   1164460|00000000||Hm, well… spent a few idyllic months in Beauclair some time past. Part of me wanted to come back, I think.
   1165142|00000000||Oh, yes. Visit Toussaint once, and you'll always long to return.
   1176774|00000000||Someone… someone's eaten from our bowls!
   1189139|00000000||Seems the brute is not here. We cannot change this. We must live with it, desist…
   1202238|00000000||I'm glad to have met you. Exceedingly so.
   1202240|00000000||To journey with you is pure pleasure.
   1102503|00000000||Found this.
   1102505|00000000||Jean-Luc…
   1103309|00000000||Sorry. Really, I am.
   1102507|00000000||Lock of hair inside… it's yours, isn't it?
   1102509|00000000||Yes. Jean-Luc and I… Well, I'm certain you've pieced it together already.
   1103311|00000000||I thank you… for your discretion… for… avenging him. Please, it's terribly modest, I know, but you must take this reward… My husband is certain to be miserly with his gold. Now, if I may… I'd like to be alone.
   1102459|00000000||Yes. Here - his locket.
   1102518|00000000||Hm. No, not yet.
   1102460|00000000||Not yet. Farewell.
   1102451|00000000||So… have you… have you found him?
   1208438|00000000||Folk say some large armored mole tunneled beneath the foundations.
   1208440|00000000||It's why things are toppling.
   1208442|00000000||A blind giant, this damned beast. Meandered all about.
   1208444|00000000||Quite a bit of stone and brick work awaits.
   1208446|00000000||That it does.
   1205388|cb29ceea||Scar
   1197150|00000000||Witcher!
   1162664|00000000||Will you help us, witcher?
   1162662|00000000||Heard about our Beast?
   1162666|00000000||Drop the weapon.
   1162670|00000000||I'm coming for you!
   1162672|00000000||I'll lop off his head!
   1162668|00000000||There'll be naught left of you to gather!
   1162676|00000000||Fair folk! It's recommended you stay in your homes after dark!
   1162674|00000000||Anyone making trouble during the festival will be severely punished!
   1162678|00000000||Witcher! We've enough problems as it is!
   1167590|00000000||I thank you for the game. No hard feelings, I trust?
   1167592|00000000||Skellige won, like you wanted. That's what matters.
   1198379|00000000||Now, to determine the ultimate victor, Geralt of Rivia, playing the Skellige faction, shall face Yaki Rafiberg, playing…
   1199928|00000000||Scoia'tael!
   1199930|00000000||Let the better man… or dwarf… win!
   1198377|00000000||The Grande Finale - witness it now! Count Monnier, playing the Skellige faction, against Yaki Rafiberg, playing…
   1199922|00000000||Scoia'tael!
   1200110|00000000||Let the better man… or dwarf… win!
   1198373|00000000||Skellige won - what a bundle of pish! Tournament's not done. Now it's my turn.
   1198375|00000000||That is what we agreed. Let us resolve our differences here and now.
   1167584|00000000||Congratulations! The best man has won - playing the best faction, to boot.
   1167586|00000000||Thanks, good game.
   1197837|00000000||The lads at the quarry are back to cracking rocks. Apparently, that ace from the North came, scrubbed away the curse and rid the skies of cows!
   1197839|00000000||Heheh. Some crack fighter's beaten the Maestro. That's the word. Maestro burst into tears, then decided to turn druid! Hmhmhm.
   1197835|00000000||Raiders have sunk so much loot off the Skellige Isles, you could fish for treasure for a year… and still not fish it all out! Or so they say…
   1183080|00000000||The girl from Corvo Bianco goes walking…
   1183082|00000000||And when she passes, each one she passes goes, "Aaaaah."
   1183312|00000000||Witcher, we thank you, each and every one of us!
   1183310|00000000||I'm so relieved all that's over… Long live the duquessa!
   1197843|00000000||Pure flim-flam, that. What're you trying to pull…?
   1197841|00000000||Huh, bloody not bad, that.
   1183090|00000000||Yeaah?
   1183084|00000000||Hey there.
   1183086|00000000||Graylocks! Silvermane! Argh!
   1183088|00000000||Ah!

   1207203|00000000||Geralt chased Sir Milton’s murderer with mad intensity. How this chase ended stands as clear witness to the fact Geralt was facing a highly dangerous foe: the killer led Geralt to an old warehouse, where it set a trap for him. A fight ensued, and at a crucial moment Geralt was saved by Regis, a higher vampire and old friend. Here I must explain that, years ago, Regis had joined Geralt’s band of fellow travelers (of which I was a proud part) and set off with us in search of Ciri. Together we lived through many fascinating adventures and Regis proved himself a loyal friend, the kind you can trust with your life. Sadly, the expedition ended tragically for Regis. He was killed by Vilgefortz, who reduced him to nothing more than a wet stain.<br><br>Hence the witcher’s immense surprise at encountering his old friend – after all, he had seen Regis die with his own eyes. But the thing is, that was not Regis’ “final” death, nor even his first. As a young man, Regis had been a bit of a free spirit and overindulged in the drinking of blood. This lifestyle led to him being butchered by angry villagers. Regenerating from that took him fifty years – or nearly no time at all, for an immortal. When he was back in full health, he kicked the habit of blood drinking for good.<br><br>For years, we’d all thought he was gone forever. Yet there he was, standing in front of Geralt in that dockside warehouse.<br><br>Regis explained he had regenerated and come to Toussaint to find Dettlaff, a friend.<br><br>Such were the dramatic circumstances bringing Regis and Geralt together again in Beauclair. They did not have long to enjoy their reunion, however. They could hear others approaching and Regis, not wanting to risk an encounter with angry humans, agreed to meet back up with Geralt at the cemetery where he had made an altogether comfortable temporary home for himself.<br>
   1207887|00000000||Geralt found Mère-Lachaiselongue Cemetery and the crypt where Regis not only lived, but had also managed to set up a well-equipped alchemist’s workshop. They began to confer. Regis explained he believed his friend had become implicated in some serious trouble. When they figured out they had overlapping goals, they decided to join forces and together seek out the vampire Dettlaff, better known in the duchy as the Beast of Beauclair.<br><br>Geralt also learned how it was Regis had returned to the world of the living. He had been helped by none other than the very one they sought: Dettlaff. In light of this, Regis insisted they find a peaceful solution to the “Dettlaff problem.”<br><br>Geralt and Regis decided that an aid was needed to find Dettlaff, a certain potion called Resonance. To brew it, Regis needed some bodily tissue from the object of their pursuit. Luckily, Geralt had earlier found a dismembered hand belonging to the murderer. Another ingredient needed to brew Resonance was saliva (or salivary glands) from a spotted wight. Having discovered that one such creature resided nearby, Regis sent the Witcher to hunt it down.<br>
   1207891|00000000||Geralt’s encounter with the wight left him with the ingredient Regis needed to brew Resonance. Once he’d delivered, however, he learned there was still one thing missing: the blood of a higher vampire. Geralt thought this would prove no trouble until Regis explained only the blood of a vampire in a highly aggravated state would do. They thus would need to invoke maddening bloodlust in Regis, who had abstained from that vampiric vice for years.<br>
   1207892|00000000||Regis brought Geralt to Tesham Mutna. This grim place had been used by vampires ages ago to raise humans like cattle. Geralt later said even the air in that place smelled of pain and fear. Regis could not vouch for how he would handle the upcoming ordeal and had Geralt lock him in a hanging cage, from which he was to watch as Geralt butchered.<br><br>Having placed bait to lure out monsters, Geralt began his slaughter. Blood flowed at Tesham Mutna once again, and Regis nearly went mad with desire. In the end, the two friends came to possess the blood of a higher vampire in a state of aroused fury.<br>
   1207894|00000000||Geralt imbibed the Resonance potion Regis had prepared, allowing him to see a fragment of the day Dettlaff had committed his most recent murder. The trail led the friends to the shuttered up toy shop where Dettlaff had been staying.<br><br>Sadly our heroes did not find Dettlaff at home. They did not leave empty handed, however. After searching the shop, Geralt found a letter which revealed Dettlaff was being blackmailed. The blackmailers had kidnapped his lover, Rhenawedd, and threatened to torture her if he did not do as they said. Thus Dettlaff had killed the targets they designated. After a short consultation, Geralt and Regis decided to split up. Regis was to wait for Dettlaff, while Geralt would go to Anna Henrietta and report on the investigation’s progress.<br>
   1207954|00000000||In their pursuit of the blackmailers, Geralt and Anna Henrietta found themselves at a private residence used for meetings of the Mandragora – an exclusive club for the boheme of Toussaint. The residence’s owner turned out to be a woman named Orianna. To the witcher’s great displeasure, later that evening they were joined by Regis, in the company of… Dettlaff. In the conversation that ensued, Geralt gathered Regis and Orianna were old friends.<br><br>The entire conversation had a rather surreal nature, seeing as how the duchess had no idea she was speaking to the dreaded Beast himself. Its key outcome was the conclusion that the blackmailers were holding Dettlaff’s lover at a place known as Dun Tynne. Geralt pulled Regis aside and they conferred briefly. Geralt was firmly against revealing this information to Dettlaff. To his thinking, this could lead to serious trouble. I must say, I agree with the witcher’s reasoning. When a higher vampire loses his self-control, trouble always ensues. Bloody trouble.<br>
   1207957|00000000||Geralt went to Dun Tynne alone, leaving Regis behind to watch Dettlaff. Or such was the plan, but life has a habit of making a mockery of men’s plans. The vampires kept tabs on Geralt’s progress through the use of avian allies and thus were the instant he found himself in dire straits. They reacted at once. Soon, Dun Tynne was drenched in blood.<br>
   1207967|00000000||Regis helped Geralt gain an audience with the mysterious vampire known as the Unseen Elder. Thanks to this Elder’s help, Geralt and Regis found the place where Dettlaff had been hiding. Events then unfolded at a rapid pace. Dettlaff flew into a rage and a fight ensued. Geralt managed to defeat him in a bloody battle, but a higher vampire can only be truly killed by one of his brethren. This was perhaps the most difficult decision Regis had ever faced in his life. He killed his friend, having decided Dettlaff’s failure to adapt to this world was a burden his friend could no longer bear.<br>
   1207969|00000000||Regis helped Geralt find a way to enter the Land of a Thousand Fables. There Geralt found Syanna and brought her to a meeting with Dettlaff. As Regis had feared, his friend proved incapable of restraining his rage and killed his one-time love. He then said he bore no ill will towards Geralt and Regis and wished to go his way. The witcher let him do so. Regis decided to accompany his friend and followed after him, hoping to help him regain spiritual balance.<br>
   1208901|00000000||Regis helped Geralt find a way to enter the Land of a Thousand Fables. There Geralt found Syanna and brought her to a meeting with Dettlaff. As Regis had feared, his friend proved incapable of restraining his rage and tried to kill his one-time love. Yet right before his blow struck, Syanna disappeared, whisked away to a safe place by the magic ribbon she had taken from the Land of a Thousand Fables. Dettlaff then vented his fury on Geralt and Regis. A fight ensued. Geralt managed to defeat Dettlaff in a bloody battle, but a higher vampire can only be truly killed by one of his brethren. This was perhaps the most difficult decision Regis had ever faced in his life. He killed his friend, having decided Dettlaff’s failure to adapt to this world was a burden his friend could no longer bear.<br>
   1207968|00000000||Regis helped Geralt find a way to enter the Land of a Thousand Fables. There Geralt found Syanna and brought her to a meeting with Dettlaff. Alas, during this meeting Dettlaff proved unable to control his rage and killed his one-time love. He then said he bore no ill will towards Geralt and Regis and wished to leave, but Geralt refused to let him. A fight ensued. Geralt managed to defeat Dettlaff in a bloody battle, but a higher vampire can only be truly killed by one of his brethren.

   1178517|00000000||I do not know, nor do I know of, a single soul more experienced than Geralt in his profession. To surprise the witcher takes incredible guile, yet the murderer sowing terror throughout Toussaint managed just that. The witcher caught up to the killer, there was a brief exchange, then a fight most fierce ensued. I cannot say how the duel would have ended had our old friend Regis not appeared and intervened. Thus, Geralt's first confrontation with the Beast went unresolved.<br>
   1178516|00000000||When word of yet another murder reached the tourney participants, panic broke out among them. Geralt, affected by no such emotion, remained on the killer's tail as they rushed helter-skelter through the streets of Beauclair. The witcher finally cornered the murderer in an old, abandoned storehouse.<br>

   1189857|00000000||A curious land, this Toussaint.
   1196564|00000000||True. Each time I come here, I sense I've entered a fairytale world.
   1196566|00000000||Most amusingly, the locals believe all that tripe. For instance, the giant which the knight they call Guillaume slew - they claim it was cursed.
   1196568|00000000||Guillaume will do anything to impress a woman.
   1196570|00000000||Here all seek to make an impression through what they do.
   1196572|00000000||It can be interesting at times. I would not at all mind it if a knight were to slay a giant for me.
   1172508|00000000||As they say, work's no woody - leave it long as you like, it'll still be hard.
   1172506|00000000||I could tell from afar - you, sir, are a professional!
   1172512|00000000||Flibbertigibbet… it's hot in here!

   1127574|00000000||This where I find the boxer they call the Maestro?
   1127576|00000000||Maestro, Champ, The Undefeated - folk call him many things. You are the witcher who dropped the three lesser champions?
   1127578|00000000||I am. Come to fight the Maestro, but seems to me he's… indisposed.
   1127580|00000000||Alcohol is the Maestro's remedy for his crippling shyness. He's a delicate man, you see? He'd never so much as hit a pillow while sober.
   1197185|00000000||Fighting sober's like dancing to silence.
   1127562|00000000||Not too drunk to fight?
   1127565|00000000||Forget fighting. Sure you can stand? You're blind drunk.
   1127567|00000000||Not your bumbopping business! Ugh! You chit, you chat, while my vodka's gone flat. Will you fight - yea or nay?

   1170878|00000000||I'll drink.
   1170879|00000000||In that case, not going to fight.

   1127588|00000000||Meaning?
   1127590|00000000||Meaning you're to drink - or hey-diddle-diddle out of here.
   1127582|00000000||So? Ready to rattle? You know the rules. Drink or get the feck out.

   1196613|00000000||I heard half the Ducal Guard took part. But I've no notion what it was about.
   1196615|00000000||They say the Beast had sought shelter there.
   1196617|00000000||Folk say all sorts of rubbish. If the Beast had been there, why would they keep it secret?

   1206179|00000000||Ever since the count died, I've not had the resources to buy raw materials - meaning no new barrel hoops, no tools… So I mustered a few lads and went in the woods to scavenge.
   1206181|00000000||A great deal of scrap to be had in those elven ruins, if you don't mind digging. Folk say the place is haunted, but I've no fear of elven ghosts!

   1206185|00000000||Rational or superstitious, it matters not. The point is, I did not see a single ghost. Yet a hanse, yes, that we ran into. Though it seems I've more luck than sense, because you came along to save me!

   1175439|00000000||So? Will you see what's amiss in my storehouse?
   1175453|00000000||Have you time now? Will you help with the beasts?
   1175449|00000000||Wound doesn't look good. Patch that up quick if I were you, before it starts festering.
   1175451|00000000||If I needed medical advice, I'd have called for a healer. And you look like nonesuch, not even a quack.
   1184096|00000000||Mhm. And if you wanted a witcher to help you, you should've thought twice about being rude.
   1184098|00000000||Forgive me… The pain's so blasted bad, it's darkened my mood… A foulness has made its lair in the grotto. I barely escaped with my life. I've been eyeing the cave for a storehouse quite some time. Would you look inside?
   1175457|00000000||See what I can do. Wait here… and you need to clean that wound, trust me.
   1175454|00000000||See what I can do.
   1175461|00000000||I will, soon enough. Patience.
   1175459|00000000||Maybe later. Got more urgent matters in mind right now.
   1175455|00000000||Maybe some other time.
   1210217|00000000||My fee - let's talk.
   1210221|00000000||Guess I could have a look… Not for free, though.
   1210223|00000000||Why, for that much I could hire an entire team of knights errant!
   1210225|00000000||Well, that's closer to sensible… but still too much.
   1210229|00000000||I've had my fill of haggling. Will you take the job or not?
   1210227|00000000||A fair offer.
   1153918|00000000||Ah, witcher! Welcome back!
   1153922|00000000||How's the leg?
   1153929|00000000||Leg better?
   1153931|00000000||It's healing nicely… but there will be a scar.
   1184148|00000000||Good. Something to impress the ladies with.
   1184150|00000000||I prefer to impress them with my charm, intellect and manners.
   1184152|00000000||Yeah. Good luck with that.
   1153921|00000000||What do you trade in?
   1153927|00000000||Maybe we could do some trading?
   1153923|00000000||I'm off.
   1153925|00000000||I'm off. See you later.
   1175445|00000000||Done that already. Ran into a few giant centipedes.
   1175447|00000000||Ah-ha… and how am I to prevent them from crawling back in?
   1184154|00000000||Don't know. I kill monsters, don't predict the future.
   1201840|00000000||You needn't be cross, witcher. You shall get a good price on all my goods - in gratitude. Come back in two days' time. You will see the fine storehouse I've made!
   1175463|00000000||Oy…! Master witcher! Ugh… Come here, please!
   1205912|00000000||And what's the situation?
   1178523|00000000||Open the gate!
   1161545|00000000||Unicorn horn?
   1161552|00000000||The golden fish and the horn both contain things or clues that will help us find Milton. Once you have fish and horn, find me among the other phoenix egg hunters.
   1199510|00000000||All clear? Then let's get to it.
   1199443|00000000||The unicorn… how do I catch it?
   1199445|00000000||It's terribly skittish, true, but I'm sure you will find a way to earn its trust.
   1199511|00000000||It runs around over there - look.
   1199448|00000000||Golden fish… Do I need a rod, or a net…?
   1199450|00000000||Please, Geralt. It's not a real fish.
   1199452|00000000||Look there, towards the water - see the lights? The hunters are trying to hook the fish from boats. You must simply dive in and find it.
   1199441|00000000||Golden fish?
   1199439|00000000||You will get hold of the unicorn horn and the golden fish, while I nab the phoenix egg. That will be quickest.
   1185154|00000000||I shall show you where the hunt plays out, then we will split up.
   1199436|00000000||On second thought, through here.
   1207208|0039242a||Zorg
   1193530|00000000||Yeah, right.
   1193532|00000000||Ooooo! Booooo-hooo…. Oooo….
   1169747|00000000||Once you have finished examining the corpse, be sure to report to Anarietta.
   1169749|00000000||Anarietta?
   1182156|00000000||Her Grace the duchess. I forget myself at times.
   1182158|00000000||We address each other by our first names in private. Never in Palmerin's presence, however. He finds such familiarity offensive.
   1169743|00000000||I shall have to leave you soon. Return to court.
   1169745|00000000||Barely got back to Toussaint.
   1182152|00000000||A knight in the service of Her Illustrious Highness knows no rest.
   1182154|00000000||In fact, I'd feared I would return too late to fulfill my duty. Yet it seems I've arrived in the nick of time.
   1169838|00000000||While strolling along the banks of the Sansretour, Geralt came upon a riverboat. Within it, he found the remains of its captain. The old salt had not parted with his ship's log, even in death. His curiosity piqued, the witcher proceeded to look through the mariner's notes…<br>
   1169839|00000000||Geralt thus learned the boat's story, including how it had run aground. But that was not all, no, that was not all! A shaelmaar had played a part in the boat's demise. The monster could still be prowling about. In his ship's log, the captain also mentioned a casket brimming with jewels. The witcher resolved to kill the beast and find the treasure!<br>
   1169840|00000000||All shaelmaars are demanding foes, and this one proved no different. Yet in his time Geralt had bested beasts far more ferocious. So he first gutted the monster, then found the chest full of precious stones.<br>
   1169841|00000000||Read the captain's log.
   1169842|00000000||Find the treasure chest.
   1169837|00000000||What Was This About Again?
   1191755|00000000||You've the verve and panache of a true knight, witcher! Hail to you and be praised!
   1191446|00000000||Wow! Look!
   1191448|00000000||Nooo!
   1104645|00000000||Gotta stop by that bank.
   1190304|00000000||Yes, witcher?
   1190302|00000000||How might I aid you?
   1207683|00000000||Faster!
   1190306|00000000||Faster!
   1190310|00000000||This behavior - has it some purport?
   1190308|00000000||What are you on about?
   1190312|00000000||Our duchess is usually very kind. Until suddenly she is very unkind.
   1198417|00000000||Behold, the tourney's victor! Hallowed be his name!
   1198419|00000000||The witcher, our hero! Only one of your caliber could save us from the Beast.
   1198421|00000000||Loth Halfbreed, Starling Straggen, Filibert Fourfingers - all dead… My, oh my!
   1190314|00000000||Witcher - act always with reason.
   1207687|00000000||For the duchy! For the duquessa!
   1190318|00000000||For the duchy! For the duquessa!
   1190320|00000000||And?! Now what, witcher?!
   1190322|00000000||I shall bleed you like a stuck pig!
   1207681|00000000||And?! Now what, witcher?!
   1207689|00000000||The end! This is it!
   1207691|00000000||I shall bleed you like a stuck pig!
   1190316|00000000||The end! This is it!
   1207685|00000000||Look alive!
   1190324|00000000||Look alive!
   1168261|00000000||Victor Monnart, creator of the renowned La'Monnart cognac. Hugo and his brothers' father, must be.
   1157945|00000000||Someone needs an escort… Not something I do often, but might be worth investigating.
   1180196|00000000||When I get my hands on that twit…
   1173466|00000000||Mhm. Gotta keep looking.
   1124544|00000000||Come on… where the hell'd she go?
   1135498|00000000||*Sniff* Hair pomade… need to follow the scent, could be the lead I need.
   1135340|00000000||Got no choice, I guess. Need to wait till they're done with their break.
   1173481|00000000||Damn bureaucracy.
   1180246|00000000||Hm, a key.
   1170498|00000000||Locked. Key should be with one of the guards.
   1173464|00000000||All right… Where's window number one?
   1207612|00000000||Need to come back during the day.
    335378|05e21ea5||Guard
    442264|c9c59594||Seaman
   1150451|00000000||Eggs fell on a moss patch. They're fine except for one - it's cracked.
   1150453|00000000||Will it do?
   1150455|00000000||Think so.
   1150457|00000000||Now, what must I do?
   1189314|00000000||Sure you want to go through with this?
   1189316|00000000||Just to be sure, gonna ask one last time - positive you want to do this. If we succeed, the changes'll be irreversible. You'll probably also only have seven years left to live. At the most.
   1189318|00000000||Seven years free of the fear that someone might spy me at the wrong moment? Of the stigma of being a freak? A monster?
   1189320|00000000||Seven years of a life both true and unfettered. Yes, Geralt. I'm certain I wish to do it.
   1189323|00000000||All right.
   1189313|00000000||Focus and repeat after me.
   1189327|00000000||You need to concentrate, now. Repeat after me - Munna gan dehrau, munna finerat.
   1189366|00000000||Munna gan dehrau, munna finerat.
   1205322|00000000||Munna gan dehrau, munna finerat.
   1205465|00000000||Munna gan dehrau, munna finerat.
   1201797|00000000||Sure. I'll tell him. Farewell, Vivienne.
   1201794|00000000||Sure.
   1201795|00000000||Shouldn't you tell him yourself?
   1201799|00000000||Should tell him yourself, don't you think?
   1201801|00000000||Perhaps I should. But I would prefer not to. Convey my gratitude to him in my stead, please? Be so kind?
   1205470|00000000||Dammit…
   1150459|00000000||Geralt! Look! Look!
   1168215|00000000||Ah, gods! I shall be able to attend balls! I shall travel to Oxenfurt, to Novigrad, even! Thank you, witcher!
   1201791|00000000||Oughta thank Guillaume. He's the one hired me… to help you.
   1201793|00000000||Yes… I am grateful to him as well, immensely. Will you tell him so for me?
   1150431|00000000||Oh no! A panther's gotten at the nest!
   1150433|00000000||Stand back. I'll take care of this.
   1150429|00000000||This is the place.
   1207633|00000000||What the-- Verdomme, what is it?!
   1207634|00000000||Save me!
   1207635|00000000||Run for your lives!
   1207636|00000000||Get away, you beast!
   1186354|00000000||Stop dragging your feet!
   1061687|1d2a6527||Drunk
   1194126|00000000||Sir, leave me be, please.
   1194128|00000000||Think I'm catchin' somethin'.
   1194132|00000000||Ahhh… Akh akh akh!
   1169901|00000000||We know pitifully little.
   1169913|00000000||Don't know much. It's a spirit of some sort, torments the hermit for some unknown reason. It's immaterial, so I've got no idea how to fight it.
   1169915|00000000||If we can even find it, that is.
   1169903|00000000||Geralt, please, I got this. It's definitely an umbra, an immaterial wraith. This one's assumed the form of a horse.
   1169905|00000000||An umbra… Actually makes sense. Umbrae are completely invisible, even to witchers. But how can you be sure?
   1169907|00000000||Because it's not invisible to me, doofus. It's right over there!
   1169911|00000000||It's getting away! C'mon witcher, hop in the saddle! Gotta catch it!
   1169917|00000000||We're dealing with some kind of wraith or phantom, most likely. It visits the hermit at night, drinks her blood.
   1169919|00000000||Even if we manage to find it, I've got no idea how I could possibly fight it.
   1169900|00000000||Probably dealing with some kind of wraith. That's all we know.
   1155480|00000000||Right, Geralt. Let's sum up what we know so far.
   1179188|00000000||You're good! Yet you will still die!
   1179190|00000000||I pity you, friend.
   1179186|00000000||His footing, his feints… Primo!
   1189945|00000000||Geralt ventured out to find Damien. As the duchess' confidant, he could very well have known where Syanna was being held. Yet locating the valiant captain hardly proved an easy feat. For swarms of vampires summoned by the enraged Dettlaff now prowled the city streets.<br>In the end the witcher tracked down the Palace Guard, which had been decimated in the fight. He draw the necessary information out of its wounded commander and proceeded on his way.<br>
   1189946|00000000||Geralt had not at first planned to free Syanna. He had focused his efforts on forcing Dettlaff to reveal himself and fight. But then Geralt changed his mind. I cannot rightly say why. It's possible Regis persuaded him, though it's just as likely the witcher had concluded he would not slay a sentient creature, all the more so because said creature had been betrayed…<br>
   1189947|00000000||Just as Damien had advised, Regis and Geralt went to the playroom at the Ducal Palace. It seemed a strange choice for a prison, but Anna Henrietta was known to have oft unusual ideas.<br>The witcher and the vampire searched the room but found no sign of Syanna. They deduced she had to be concealed inside an illusion. The mage Artorius Vigo had created it years earlier, for the ducal daughters when they were but children. It was a fairytale land one could enter through the room…<br>
   1189948|00000000||The Land of a Thousand Fables was an extraordinary place. Now, it was also extraordinarily dangerous. For Artorius Vigo's spell, cast many years earlier, had begun to degenerate, change and grow wild. This was the result of something called magic entropy. The world's fairytale characters had grown unpredictable and aggressive - something the witcher got a taste of soon into his adventure there.<br>Despite these difficulties, he found Syanna. The witcher and the duchess' sister now shared a goal - both trapped in this magical land, they needed to find the way out. They joined forces. Syanna knew the exit from the Land of a Thousand Fables lay hidden among the clouds overhead. Their first task was to find magic beans that would help them ascend.<br>
   1189954|00000000||The witcher and Syanna found all the beans at last. They planted them and climbed the stalk that sprouted into the clouds. High in the sky they spied a castle, then the giant who called it home. "A giant," you might say, then tremble in your boots. But the witcher and his companion defeated it post haste.<br>
   1189955|00000000||As Regis later told it, Syanna and Geralt seemed sheepish upon returning to our world. What's more, the witcher's leggings were laced up all wrong. I leave it to you, readers, to divine the cause of this state of affairs.<br>
   1189956|00000000||Geralt and Syanna finally left the Land of a Thousand Fables. Meanwhile in the city, the massacre had raged unchecked. Yet Syanna had returned, so hope burned anew. If Dettlaff and his former lover could be made to meet, the vampires' rampage in the city could come to an end.<br>
   1190052|00000000||A boy named Joss would know where to find the magic beans. Yet Joss - who obsessively cried "Wolf!" - was known by all to be a pathological liar. He proved hard to pin down, for his convoluted clues were the exact opposite of the truth.<br>By Joss' reckoning the red bean "had not been swallowed," though the one who had not swallowed it was the "most humany human in all the land." The blue bean, on the other hand, "lay out in the open" watched over by "nobody" times three. The yellow bean, in turn, could be found "deep underground," a "bald farm-hand" its guard and keeper.<br>
   1153338|00000000||Go to the playroom.

   1196655|00000000||Upon Lac Célavy's waters floats an isle. There you will learn all. I must ride where destiny calls! Godspeed till next we meet!
   1205863|00000000||Lac Célavy… Might be worth looking into.
   1205869|00000000||While tending to the problems at Matilda Vermentino's vineyard, Geralt happened on a curious note.<br>
   1205870|00000000||It suggested one Augustin Tonneliay had not been an honest man. Somewhere within the confines of the vineyard, he had stashed a considerable sum - his proceeds from illicit sales.<br>
   1205871|00000000||Geralt found the treasure chest and emptied it of its valuable store. The now-dead, dishonest Augustine simply no longer needed it.<br>
   1214153|00000000||While milling about the duchy's highroads and tracts, Geralt happened on a secluded hut. Alas, even the fragrant herbs growing all around it could not mask the stench of the rotfiends feeding nearby. The witcher set his silver sword in motion, then found an interesting note on the body on which the now dead necrophages had been feeding…<br>
   1205872|00000000||Read Augustine Tonneliay's journal.
   1205873|00000000||Find the chest hidden in the sunflower field.
   1205868|00000000||Don't Take Candy from a Stranger
   1197813|00000000||That ruffian, Filibert Fourfingers - do you know how he got his name? He was a cooper, see, went to cut a barrel stave and cut off his finger instead!
   1197815|00000000||Do you know who recovered Reginald's jewels? The witcher! It seems some lonely widow had stolen them after bandits killed her hubby.
   1197811|00000000||They say the dye man at the port has such extraordinary new colors, some of the Belles charge him less if he dyes their skirts!
   1186868|00000000||Lebioda's chapped heels! I've got roaring heartburn!
   1186870|00000000||Long live Toussaint!
   1186872|00000000||Get moving, witcher! Scarper while you can! You've already seen the inside of the clink!
   1186866|00000000||I'd not show myself to Her Grace anytime soon were I in your shoes…
   1197819|00000000||Actually, you don't even believe that.
   1197817|00000000||Unbelievable!
   1186880|00000000||The witcher from the North!
   1186874|00000000||Hey diddle diddle! The cat and the fiddle!
   1186876|00000000||Guard! Guard!
   1186878|00000000||Devils take you!
    515498|00307f1b||Goat
   1180711|00000000||You killed it… Single-handedly? That harlotsbrood slaughtered half my unit!
   1180713|00000000||See it came damn close to slaughtering you as well.
   1151458|00000000||Leave it to me.
   1176632|00000000||Your problem's my problem now. Leave it to me, I'll solve it.
   1176634|00000000||How?
   1180724|00000000||Yeah, I know it. Doesn't mean I have to agree with it.
   1180726|00000000||You've that luxury. I do not. I've sworn my loyalty to Her Grace.
   1151495|00000000||Won't insist.
   1151497|00000000||Can't force you. Won't try.
   1151499|00000000||But I'd urge you to ask yourself a question… How'll you feel tomorrow when you bury more soldiers while knowing you might've prevented their deaths - but chose not to even try?
   1180757|00000000||If Her Grace learns I helped you, my head will roll.
   1180759|00000000||And mine'll come right after. Still willing to take the risk.
   1175594|00000000||Let's go, Regis.
   1175591|00000000||Playroom - let's go.
   1175596|00000000||Meet you by the playroom, Regis.
   1175618|00000000||So be it. But try not to tarry.
   1175592|00000000||Meet you at the playroom.
   1180801|00000000||And… you've our gratitude. You helped us a great deal.
   1180803|00000000||I helped Beauclair. At least, I hope I did.
   1151542|00000000||When… when last I saw Syanna, Her Grace was escorting her to the palace playroom.
   1151545|00000000||Playroom? As in, for children? You sure?
   1151547|00000000||I've served in the Ducal Palace for years. I know its every corner. So yes, I am damn sure.
   1151549|00000000||Playroom… So what, duchess lock Syanna up in a dollhouse?
   1151551|00000000||Honestly? I've no clue. Look, I've told you what I saw. What you do with it is no concern of mine.
   1185126|00000000||Got it… I'll look into it. You get back to your barracks. Retrace my steps, path oughta be clear.
   1180762|00000000||See I'm wasting time here.
   1180765|00000000||Wait.
   1180767|00000000||I fear we waste our time here. Come, Geralt.
   1180770|00000000||Wait.
   1151532|00000000||If Her Grace learns I helped you, my head will roll.
   1151534|00000000||And ours will follow right after it. Yet still we are prepared to take the risk.
   1180732|00000000||Folk're dying. Many more will. Because of one.
   1151494|00000000||Folk're dying. More will perish. Because of one.
   1180722|00000000||We know it. But we do not agree with it.
   1180730|00000000||You've that luxury. I do not. I've sworn my loyalty to Her Grace.
   1151477|00000000||All I can say just now is I'm gonna need Syanna.
   1151480|00000000||You know the duchess' decision. Syanna awaits her trial. In custody.
   1176628|00000000||Got a different plan.
   1176630|00000000||Hm. And what would that be?
   1151457|00000000||Got a different plan.
   1176620|00000000||Need to withdraw, you and your men. Now.
   1151449|00000000||My duty lies with the city.
   1151451|00000000||Won't help the city by leading your men to the slaughter. Damien… conversation back at the palace, remember? I'll say it again - your men don't stand a chance.
   1151453|00000000||Men! Tend to the wounded and prepare to march out!
   1201238|00000000||Doing the right thing… Now listen close. Silver - that's what you want to use against vampires. Your alchemists, order them to produce as much vampire oil as they can, churn it out in gallons. Then coat your blades with it.
   1201240|00000000||Keep an eye out for alps and bruxae. The shapely ones, resemble women. There one moment, gone the next. Bombs containing silver splinters are a pretty good idea.
   1176622|00000000||Thank you, witcher. I hope you're worth the coin the duchess pledged you. And that you'll return with the head of the wretch that did this skewered on a hook.
   1180718|00000000||I see the harlotsbrood came close to slaughtering you as well.
   1166087|00000000||Blast. Blast it all…
   1168669|00000000||You must wait. They have their break now.
   1186785|00000000||So, what do you hope to get here, my friend?
   1168671|00000000||Permit A38. Though, guess I need Form 202 as well, now.
   1168673|00000000||Form 202? Easy peasy! Certificate P - now that is a challenge…
   1168675|00000000||But as we are both forced to wait… fancy a round of gwent?
   1169081|00000000||She's not there. You must wait.
   1169083|00000000||Pardon me?
   1169085|00000000||Miss Constance, window one. She went on her break and has yet to return. So we wait.
   1178199|00000000||Don't have much of a choice, I guess…
   1178201|00000000||Perhaps you would fancy a round of gwent? To kill the time…?
   1168728|00000000||A seasoned player, I see. Congratulations.
   1168732|00000000||As your prize, I shall reveal to you my foolproof method for cutting through this bureaucracy. Nothing ever comes of using the normal channels.
   1168734|00000000||Wow… Didn't stand a chance there.
   1168736|00000000||Years of practice, my friend. I've stood in these queues so long, I could not help but learn a great many tricks…
   1178195|00000000||Speaking of which, I've a tip for you, a means to resolve your matter…
   1168738|00000000||I have seen them try everything. Magic, hypnosis, bribery… nothing works.
   1168740|00000000||Might as well go if nothing works. There's nothing I can do?
   1168742|00000000||Be kind, be pleasant. This and only this. The woman, here, she sits at her window twelve hours each day without hearing so much as a "good day" from anyone.
   1178408|00000000||But muster up some flowers, some perfume, well, you will resolve your matter lickety-split.
   1169778|00000000||Right, certainly worth a shot.
   1169780|00000000||Good luck!
   1168681|00000000||See you know this place pretty well. Must've taken care of a good amount of business…
   1168683|00000000||Naturally, my friend, naturally… indeed, I've managed to work the system a time or two.
   1178243|00000000||You see, such things require finesse, subtlety. Otherwise, you're stuck!
   1168677|00000000||See you know your way around here.
   1168676|00000000||Why not.
   1168679|00000000||Why not. Let's lay' em out.
   1178178|00000000||Now that I understand! I'll start arranging my deck.
   1213758|00000000||The first group traveling to the construction site was said to consist of master builders who were bringing with them a supply of highly useful tools. Geralt hoped that something had merely befallen their wagon - a snapped axle or a broken wheel - but, just in case, he steeled himself for the worst.<br>
   1213759|00000000||The wagon had been ambushed by bandits. Geralt arrived in the nick of time to save the tool transport and passengers. Soon after, they were en route once more for their destination.<br>
   1214138|00000000||While traveling across the lovely lands of Toussaint, Geralt came across a group of workers who had been attacked by bandits. At the time, the witcher did not yet know these were builders constructing the Prophet Lebioda’s statue and his intervention would determine whether or not that monumental work would ever be finished.
   1214139|00000000||Luckily for the Prophet’s followers, Geralt is a decent man who lends his help to anyone who needs it. Once he had defeated the bandits, the building crew could continue on to its destination.
   1212681|00000000||Help the workers defeat the bandits.
   1212680|00000000||Big Feet to Fill: The First Group
   1196661|00000000||Really?!
   1196663|00000000||Bollocks. Enough said.
   1184634|00000000||Sir Geralt, the tourney's victor!
   1184636|00000000||Sir Ravix, the tourney's champion!
   1184630|00000000||You wish to live forever? Invest in a bard!
   1184632|00000000||For tourney participants - chivalric epics, half price!
   1184644|00000000||In need of a song, sir knight? Or an epic poem, perchance?
   1184638|00000000||All due respect.
   1184640|00000000||My knight?!
   1196667|00000000||Have you heard? The witcher gave the Maestro a licking so fierce the bruiser retched up his supper!
   1196669|00000000||Jean Louis has been found! The witcher from the North saved his hiney. It seems some knight sought to starve him to death - vengeance for a bad haircut!
   1196665|00000000||The hanses mean no end of trouble for the merchants. Another caravan's gone missing, and the river spat up more bodies… all decapitated!
   1184642|00000000||Help! Someone! Good folk!
   1181403|00000000||Charming place. But… what're all those cages for? Mentioned one vampire being kept here.
   1180116|00000000||Yes, well… You see, humanitarians is something my ancestors were not. They concluded Khagmar would best be punished if he were tormented with the scent of blood he could not taste.
   1202334|00000000||Thus, they also kept humans here, humans whose blood they slowly let. Khagmar ranted and raged in pain as those… those humans slowly bled to death…
   1193539|00000000||They treated them like livestock, live bait.
   1180118|00000000||I'd like to be able to turn back time, deny it, but alas… I can do neither. Feel shame for my brethren, that is all I can do.
   1193534|00000000||Don't take it so hard. Nothing you could've done about it. Let's get to work.
   1174724|00000000||Well, that was awkward. Fine. I prepared the bait, please be so kind and place it. Ideally at the tunnel entrances - the scent will spread most effectively, then.
   1185998|00000000||It's not far now, Geralt.
   1175004|00000000||Place the bait at the tunnel entrances. Monsters will catch its scent more quickly.
   1180126|00000000||When I think how these tunnels got here… sends shivers.
   1180128|00000000||It was the natural order of things - the place reeked of death and attracted necrophages.
   1186000|00000000||Three done, one left. Think this'll work?
   1186002|00000000||I certainly hope so. The meat's stench is so thick I wager it carries clear to Novigrad.
   1175008|00000000||Feel all right, Regis?
   1175010|00000000||How I feel is unimportant. My blood, agitated and transformed - that's what matters. It's what we need to save Dettlaff.
   1172900|00000000||What if I tossed everything and ran off to Nilfgaard?
   1172898|00000000||And for supper, a pot-au-feu…
   1172902|00000000||Mhm…. Yes?
   1177122|00000000||What's that? What?
   1184833|00000000||Uncie says if I'm bad, he'll give me to the witchers!
   1184835|00000000||Can I shoot your crossbow?
   1184831|00000000||A witcher goes a-walking, a-walking, a-walking, a witcher goes a-walking on a bright summer's day!
   1184839|00000000||Uncie doesn't let me talk to strangers.
   1184837|00000000||I know who you are! You're that werewitch!
   1183815|00000000||At thunderous speed with lances they strike, many a knight shall not leave with his life. A wild flash fills one man's eyes, through another's veins hot blood flies…
   1183817|00000000||All praise to the knights who err!
   1183821|00000000||Yes, noble knight?
   1183819|00000000||Aaaaah! Yes?
   1166096|19a6c7bf||Spoon Collector
   1178977|00000000||You turdlick!
   1178979|00000000||Pummel the pale pecker! Pummel him!
   1178975|00000000||You flabby twootflap!
   1144547|00000000||Saint Plegmund's toes! You're… you're Geralt of Rivia!
   1144545|00000000||Would you hunt my beastly mother-in-law?
   1144549|00000000||Hey! Sword, sheathe it, now.
   1144553|00000000||Whack him! Whack him good!
   1144555|00000000||We will teach you decency!
   1144551|00000000||Ashes, ashes, the wolf falls down!
   1144559|00000000||Gads, my knees ache something horrible…
   1144557|00000000||All work and no play, right, witcher?
   1144561|00000000||Hold it! Where are your manners?!
   1191285|00000000||Give us a crown?
   1165370|00000000||Come on, who's next?
   1165372|00000000||Ahh, Lebioda's lips, my legs are wilting.
   1193606|00000000||Sit in jail long enough for the rot to set in, witcher?
   1165368|00000000||And you drool like a boar sniffing juniper cones…
   1165366|00000000||Taut as a ram's goolies, you are.
   1172713|9cb2dced||Architect
   1050087|b2e674f6||Thug
   1191175|00000000||Mmm?
   1191763|00000000||What you've done for us, Geralt of Rivia! Everyone shall hear of it!
   1120627|00000000||I think it is life that imitates art. And not vice versa.
   1120628|00000000||Right you are, Fingal. Take Baron de Cordelle, for one.
   1120629|00000000||Oh yes, that nose - he actually had a mage enlarge it after he saw that de Rebcarege play.
   1120630|00000000||And now he's begun courting his cousin!
   1200652|00000000||Something dug 'em, a large creature. Also killed a few kikimores down there. They'd managed to lay eggs, already. Consider it a half favor, won't cost you much.
   1200654|00000000||Did you exterminate them all? Did you burn the eggs? Thought not. I'll not pay you a copper. I must send men down there to deal with the filth as it should be dealt with.
   1163222|00000000||Hmm. Should be enough to go on.
   1163224|00000000||Then what are you fritting around here for?! Get to work!
   1163163|00000000||Madame, could you describe Jean-Luc?
   1163165|00000000||Tall… exceedingly well-built… hair black as pitch…
   1163167|00000000||Dear, concentrate. There is not a peasant that is not well-built - they work in the fields all day. He means scars, birthmarks - that sort of thing!
   1163180|00000000||Hm… Then none, I suppose, but… he did wear a pendant around his neck. A silver one.
   1163182|00000000||Silver jewelry? On a farmhand?
   1163184|00000000||It was a gift, I believe. Or, that is what he claimed.
   1163161|00000000||This Jean-Luc, he have any distinguishing marks?
   1163160|00000000||Where'd you see him last, exactly?
   1163214|00000000||Where'd you last see Jean-Luc, madame - exactly?
   1163216|00000000||In… in the fields, north of here, by the wood.
   1163218|00000000||New seedlings, there? I was under the distinct impression we had planted them all on the south slope…
   1163220|00000000||Almost all, my dear. I requested that some be planted to the north, by the grove. Just the remainders.
   1201746|00000000||Ahem… Madame de Bourbeau, I presume? Hear you know something about the missing farmhand.
   1200656|00000000||Jean-Luc? Yes… We went to examine this year's seedlings, something had been nibbling at them. Then we heard these odd noises. Jean-Luc went to reconnoiter… and never returned.
   1200649|00000000||Something dug 'em, a large creature. Also, killed a few kikimores down there and destroyed their eggs. Consider it a half favor, won't cost you much.
   1200651|00000000||Kikimore eggs? Yes, of course, good work… Indeed, a reward is due.
   1163159|00000000||Sackrayblue!
   1148056|00000000||What is the meaning of this?! I'm paying you to slay a monster, not demolish my property!
   1148058|00000000||Property's falling apart on its own what with all the tunnels under it. I'd fill those in soon if you don't want your building to collapse.
   1163135|00000000||Tunnels?! Fiddle my fum, how did tunnels appear down there?!
   1156300|00000000||Still here?! But why?! Seek the beast!
   1156302|00000000||Please. Find Jean-Luc.
   1164261|00000000||Hmm. Perhaps I can turn these tunnels into an extended cellar?
   1168661|00000000||Do you see this? He demolished the wall! Obliterated it! Let a churl into your home, and look what happens!! Just look!!
   1168663|00000000||Darling, calm down…
   1196295|00000000||Greetings. A nice day, eh?
   1196297|00000000||At your service.
   1196299|00000000||Ah, up yours.
   1196301|00000000||Murderers! Help!
   1188336|05e0f584||Gromm
   1191526|00000000||Hic-cup! Ooh! Gonna be sick.

   1124679|00000000||The jaw-dropping Mancomb awaits a challenger! His tongue as devastating as his fists! His ripostes bring grown men to tears! Who dares, who dares?!
   1124683|00000000||Witcher! Surely you've techniques you'd care to test and demonstrate.
   1124685|00000000||Pff! He looks like a nitwitted nancy to me. If his tongue's as tied as I think, I'll knock him down with one blow.
   1124689|00000000||You fight like a goatherd!
   1124691|00000000||Cabbage sours when it sees you coming!
   1124693|00000000||I just don't talk to mindless simpletons.
   1187452|00000000||Tah dum tah rehdl tah dum pah raaah!
   1189302|00000000||And I say hey, hey, hey, what's going on?
   1200474|00000000||Nothing says "love" like a push and a shove, hahah! To Liam and Matilda - their health!
   1187454|00000000||I'd rather be an eagle than a quail… yes, I should… if I only could, I truly would…
   1187456|00000000||The book of lust is hard and girthy… No one can grip the damn thing…
   1162945|00000000||Thought I knew 'em all. Guess I was wrong. Must be a one-off.
   1167565|00000000||Message on the back, signed by a certain … Count Monnier. Invitation to a tournament… Interesting.
   1162947|00000000||Invitation to a gwent tournament. Due to take place at the Pheasantry.
   1200250|00000000||Organized by a certain Count Monnier.
   1153146|00000000||Portal's in a fountain? Not terribly practical…
   1153148|00000000||It was a secret passage. Anarietta and I would use it to…
   1153150|00000000||… hide from your governess. Which luckily she noted down in her diary, thus I knew where to await you.
   1155243|00000000||Never mind that… Has the young lady agreed to help clean up the mess she's made?
   1155245|00000000||She has. And stop treating me as if I were a child.
   1155248|00000000||Would you prefer I treated you like the lying manipulator you are?
   1177081|00000000||Syanna, don't start a fight you can't win.
   1177089|00000000||Syanna, you've already run afoul of one vampire… Don't start a fight with another, all right?
   1177091|00000000||Then tell said other vampire to stop taunting me.
   1177124|00000000||I shall do my utmost.
   1175476|00000000||Let's go. Really want to be done with this.
   1177087|00000000||Calm down, both of you.
   1177093|00000000||But--
   1177095|00000000||No buts.
   1177080|00000000||Both of you, stop.
   1177079|00000000||Regis, calm down.
   1177083|00000000||Regis, what happened to your famous manners?
   1177085|00000000||Apologies. I forgot myself. Ahem…
   1163293|00000000||You. Can we talk?
   1163377|00000000||As for Jean-Luc… afraid he's dead. Sorry.
   1163379|00000000||Who? Oh, him… Trivial as losses go. I shall soon find another to take his place.
   1163608|00000000||Right, after all, he is just a peasant, not a Monsieur de blah-blooh-blah. So long.
   1163381|00000000||Yeah… As will Madame de Bourbeau, I bet. So long.
   1163395|00000000||Now, forgive me. I must speak to my wife.
   1163333|00000000||Got rid of the beast that was giving you trouble. It was a shaelmaar.
   1163335|00000000||Sh-shaelma? What ever could that be?
   1163337|00000000||Hmm… Kind of like a cross between a mole and a caterpillar. Just… big as a barn.
   1163339|00000000||Gulp. Ah. Uh-huh.
   1179156|00000000||Well, master witcher… you make a poor first impression but ultimately proved your worth. There, your reward.
   1102418|00000000||Monster's dead.
   1102433|00000000||We'll talk. Later.
   1102419|00000000||Not bearing anything at the moment.
   1151680|00000000||Madame de Bourbeau and the farmhand - something going on there.
   1150784|00000000||This Jean-Luc, he did have a silver pendant. Kept a lock of Madame de Bourbeau's hair in it, matter of fact.
   1150786|00000000||What? But… how could she?! To be unfaithful to me, a lord and heir… with a plough-spawned peasant?! Oh, she shall pay for this!
   1150788|00000000||Don't doubt that. But, mind paying me first? For services beyond the scope of the contract…?
   1163411|00000000||There. It'll come out of her dowry.
   1102386|00000000||You'd best be bearing good news. Get on with it.
   1163291|00000000||Monsieur de Bourbeau? Can we talk?
   1200687|00000000||The wall - fix it! By the end of the day!
   1211287|00000000||Our business. Adieu, sir.
   1193543|00000000||Enchanted.
   1193550|00000000||Pleasure's all mine.
   1193552|00000000||Yes?
   1193554|00000000||You are the famed Geralt of Rivia, are you not?
   1193558|00000000||Deepest apologies.
   1193560|00000000||Sirrah, what is this?
   1193562|00000000||Aaah!
   1194792|00000000||Bloody hell!
   1194794|00000000||Welcome, welcome.
   1194796|00000000||Stop right there, stallion.
   1181204|00000000||Tell me, friend, where have you been?
   1181232|00000000||Well then? How is it?
   1181212|00000000||Hey! Hey! Comrade!
   1181228|00000000||Guardsmen! He's flabberknacked!
   1199080|00000000||Lebioda's wounds! Save us! Kitty eyes!
   1181236|00000000||It was how it was, and it will be… as it will, somehow.
   1182497|00000000||What's up, kitty eyes?
   1126618|00000000||I challenge you to a duel.
   1126620|00000000||Mhm.
   1126646|00000000||Noble lords and virtuous ladies! Another fight is soon to begin!
   1126614|00000000||I'm in.
   1126626|00000000||Think I might come back some other time.
   1126616|00000000||Some other time.
   1126615|00000000||The knight - why doesn't he say anything?
   1126622|00000000||Like to know who I'm punching. This knight won't reveal his name or face? Won't say anything at all, not a word?
   1126624|00000000||Rein in your curiosity, sir. A knightly vow is no idle promise! Still Waters shall conceal both face and crest until such time as one defeats him.
   1191677|00000000||So, will you fight or not?
   1126607|00000000||Shall you face off against Still Waters? Shall you? Shall you?
   1126609|00000000||The famed witcher! Now here's a man who looks primed to try his strength against Still Waters! Shall you thrown down the gauntlet?
   1126613|00000000||Don't know the rules yet. Nor what I'll be fighting for.
   1170325|00000000||Fighters use their fists, and the last combatant left standing wins. Glory is the stake! The title of best pugilist in Beauclair the prize! Oh, and honor!
   1170327|00000000||Honor. How could I forget.
   1191669|00000000||Defeat all three lesser contestants and you shall gain the right to face the Maestro himself.
   1160402|00000000||Witcher! Welcome back. A duel with Still Waters - wouldn't that be something? Care to challenge?
   1196593|00000000||Barrels of Sangreal. Already brought them in from the palace.
   1206946|dc7f5750||Duchess' Leopard
   1162146|00000000||Paints… Don't look ruined. Painter should still be able to use them.
   1191753|00000000||True knightly courage you showed, witcher. We shan't forget it.
   1207034|00000000||<i>Once upon a time, there was a wicked witch. Every day after supper she’d drink a glass of freshly-squeezed corpse juice…</i><br> – Karl Hrimm, writer of  children’s fables<br><br>Though evil witches are often considered creatures born of the overactive imaginations of fabulists and mythologists, cartoonish characters only a child would ever be frightened of, there are accounts of men who claim to have happened across one of these improbable beings. All these accounts agree that the witch not only did in fact eat men, but had mastered the cooking of humans to a fine art. They are said to be particularly fond of children’s liver fried in butter and served in a saffron sauce, balsamic vinegar-marinated fingers roasted to a golden crisp and, yes, even freshly-squeezed corpse juice. It should be noted here that all the above-mentioned witnesses who swore they saw such a witch were patients of the Ellander Institute for the Mentally Ill, thus the veracity of their testimony is highly debatable.
   1207033|00000000||Wicked Witch
   1191442|00000000||Wow!
   1191444|00000000||I'm not scared! I'm not!
   1152574|00000000||Yellow bean, here it is. Would've stunk to climb all that way for nothing.
   1176361|00000000||Prince's corpse… Tried to free Longlocks, but fell and broke his neck.
   1153266|00000000||We'd always grapple up her braid in the past, but… I don't see it anywhere.
   1154010|00000000||We'll find another way up.
   1153268|00000000||Hanged herself by her own hair…
   1154012|00000000||Wait… what Joss said about the third bean, remember?
   1154014|00000000||In the possession of a bald farmhand, somewhere deep beneath the ground… Yes, this must be it. Let's go.
   1152558|00000000||This Longlock's tower?
   1154006|00000000||Indeed. It's even taller than I remembered…
   1176423|00000000||Too late! Too late!!!
   1152570|00000000||Could pull myself up here… then I'll have to make that jump…
   1152572|00000000||If you say so… I shall wait down here, if it's all the same. Climbing's not my strong suit.
   1190280|00000000||Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.
   1190278|00000000||It is not enough to speak, but to speak true.
   1207678|00000000||Long live Her Grace Anna Henrietta!
   1190282|00000000||Long live Her Grace, Anna Henrietta!
   1190286|00000000||I beseech thee, sir!
   1190284|00000000||Sir, that is most unbecoming…
   1198408|00000000||My deepest respect to the tourney's champion!
   1198410|00000000||Behold, the bravest of the brave! The scourge of Starling Straggen's hanse!
   1190288|00000000||Cowards die many times before their deaths. The valiant never taste of death but once!
   1190290|00000000||Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile. Filths savor but themselves.
   1190296|00000000||You betrayed my trust, friend.
   1190294|00000000||Ring the alarum-bells! Blow, wind! Come, wrack!
   1190298|00000000||At least I'll die with harness on my back!
   1207674|00000000||You betrayed my trust, friend.
   1207676|00000000||At least I'll die with harness on my back!
   1207670|00000000||I must be cruel only to be kind!
   1207672|00000000||Ring the alarum-bells! Blow, wind! Come, wrack!
   1190292|00000000||I must be cruel only to be kind!
   1207668|00000000||All together! No fear!
   1190300|00000000||All together! No fear!
   1198412|00000000||By my troth! I owe you my life, witcher!
   1198414|00000000||A thousand thanks for your rescue!!
   1205362|0001dd66||Ox
   1201228|00000000||Not my favorite.
   1201234|00000000||Honestly? Not one of my favorites.
   1201236|00000000||Hmph, yet I believe you will easily win the tournament wielding it.
   1198133|00000000||Ready to start if everybody else is.
   1198135|00000000||I invite you to join me on the terrace. The herald shall soon announce the tourney's start.
   1168826|00000000||Let's begin.
   1201226|00000000||Protestors have gathered outside. Quite a few, it seems.
   1200248|00000000||Hands off our bloody game! We dinnae want any new factions!
   1200252|00000000||Monnier, ye dozy cunt! Stop diddlin' with dwarven tradition!
   1198131|00000000||Change cannot always please everyone. Gwent traditionalists resent my efforts to expand the canon to include Skellige. But we shall pay them no mind.
   1201224|00000000||Protesters - what do they want?
   1168827|00000000||What factions will the others play?
   1198125|00000000||Mind telling me what factions the others'll be playing?
   1198127|00000000||It is no secret. Eric van Vrog will play the Northern Realms. His Excellency, in a flush of patriotism, chose Nilfgaard.
   1199579|00000000||Hamal ogn Dangbahli will play the Monsters deck, and Agnetha Skold has chosen Scoia'tael.
   1199581|00000000||Yours truly, of course, shall await the winner with a Skellige deck. I'm determined to prove its value.
   1168821|00000000||Any specific tournament rules? Mind giving me an overview?
   1166539|00000000||Firstly, might I introduce the contestants? Superb gwent players, all, hailing from the world's farthest corners - Hamal ogn Dangbahli, an Ofieri merchant.
   1190935|00000000||Eric van Vrog, a patrician from Novigrad. And lastly, we are proud to welcome a Skelliger…
   1190937|00000000||You blind? Not Skelliger. Skelligirl, dammit!
   1190939|00000000||Naturally, no offense meant. Agnetha Skold, her ever-charming isle temperament in evidence, along with assorted beads, baubles, ropes…
   1191118|00000000||As to the rules, they're simple. Each player adopts a faction they cannot change for the tourney's duration. Lose a match, and you're eliminated.
   1200037|00000000||The winner from among you shall advance to the semifinal to face the winner of the tourney's previous edition, His Excellency the Ambassador of the Empire of Nilfgaard, Master von Hinn.
   1191120|00000000||The winner of that match shall in turn face none other than me, your humble servant.
   1201221|00000000||Hands off our gwent!
   1201223|00000000||No new fuckin' factions!
   1201230|00000000||It's great. Faction's a pleasure to play.
   1201232|00000000||I'm glad to hear it.
   1201227|00000000||Great. Like it a lot.
   1166535|00000000||There you are! A pleasure to see you again. The Skellige faction - how do you find it?
   1166529|00000000||An impressive array. Count Monnier waits inside. You may enter.
   1166533|00000000||Thanks.
   1166525|00000000||Welcome. The tourney is under way. Might I glance at your deck?
   1166527|00000000||Sure. Here.
   1190398|00000000||If ye're thinkin' women can't play gwent for shite, ye're dead wrong.
   1190400|00000000||Primal participation is, whereas vindicating victory would be.
   1190402|00000000||I've got a lady as my first opponent. Reckon I'm sitting in the catbird seat.
   1190404|00000000||This year once more I aim to prove Nilfgaard knows no equal.
   1190406|00000000||May we all play fair, show respect for our opponents and may the best amongst us win.
   1190537|00000000||Pure gold.
   1198115|00000000||Get yer mingin' mitts off our fucking gwent!
   1198111|00000000||Gwent was perfected by dwarves o'er centuries o' play! Not about to accept some new bloody faction!
   1198117|00000000||Duvvelsheyss! Four factions since time immemorial gwent's had! An' it should buggerin' stay that way!
   1198113|00000000||Just you wait. A year on and some tosser'll have invented the "Wankers of Novigrad" faction!
   1199569|00000000||Gwent dinnae need changin'! Leave it the fuck alone!
   1191550|00000000||Good day!
   1191552|00000000||Greetings.
   1191554|00000000||Don't touch me!
   1191556|00000000||Murderer! Murderer!
   1191558|00000000||Help meee!
   1167904|33f17779||Bootblack
   1199598|00000000||Auuuggghh! If you acknowledge any gods… start praying, now.
   1199602|00000000||Aaauuuggghhrr! Do you think that will stop me? Prepare to die, witcher!
   1199586|00000000||You should have brought her, witcher. I am disappointed.
   1199588|00000000||You murdered innocents. Don't owe you a damn thing.
   1199590|00000000||I wanted just the lass. You tricked me, both of you.
   1199592|00000000||Didn't plan any of it.
   1201348|00000000||Silence!
   1199594|00000000||You bastard!
   1199596|00000000||You should not have meddled!
   1199600|00000000||That won't be necessary.
   1199604|00000000||Cut the nonsense and fight!
   1188919|00000000||Gentlemen, we've got company. Seems to me we must do ought about him, else our loot is as good as gone.
   1188915|00000000||Why the cuttledickens stick that necklace in your bloomers? Did you think I wouldn't see? We agreed - we split the loot evenly, three ways.
   1188917|00000000||I can't help it. I've been like that since I was a tot… Maybe it's because my mumsy…
   1189475|00000000||Shut it, I've heard enough of that!
   1180271|00000000||Akh akh akh!
   1156330|00000000||Agh. Leave him to me.
   1156332|00000000||Begone.
   1156334|00000000||I can't let…
   1156336|00000000||I insist.
   1156339|00000000||I'm sorry.
   1190805|00000000||Get him!
   1190807|00000000||You'll beg for death.
   1190809|00000000||Fucking don't anger me!
   1190811|00000000||Sheathe the steel.
   1190813|00000000||Mh. Better.
   1190815|00000000||I said, sheathe your steel.
   1191749|00000000||Ahh… I've no clue how to thank you, White One!
   1125884|00000000||Behold, gallant knights and ladies decorous! Gaze at the host assembled before us! Look upon chivalry's best and most storied!
   1173175|00000000||Come from far lands, here to seek glory! Hear now their names as I shout them aloud, savor their titles, of their presence be proud!

   1208995|00000000||For Gregoire of Mount Gorgon, let out a roaring cheer! The famed vower of silence, tourney champion from last year! Today's winner of contests, his victory to secure, shall face Sir Gregoire in a challenge severe!
   1157549|00000000||Does ignorance demand a bard intercede? Does someone need telling how tourneys proceed?
   1126004|00000000||Yes, I do. If you please.
   1204973|00000000||Ere the sands from the glass retire…
   1204975|00000000||Any chance you could say it normally?
   1126006|00000000||None at all. Ahem. Ere the sands from the glass retire, and hearty toil your steed does tire,
   1130595|00000000||Neath all the gates you must guide your horse, and each of five targets strike with bolts.
   1126008|00000000||Each dummy felled adds more sand to the glass,
   1126053|00000000||And each true-shot bolt repeats the task!
   1204977|00000000||Yep, all clear now…
   1125997|00000000||Yes.
   1125998|00000000||[Say nothing.]
   1178878|00000000||Ravix of Fourhorn, is that what you call yourself? You shan't fool me! To this day I bear marks where I met your steel.
   1178880|00000000||What, don't you remember? I am Tailles of Dorndal! And I swear to you, before the tourney's end, I shall have added another pock to that collection on your mug!
   1199991|00000000||Done? Then step aside. You're in my way.
   1178872|00000000||How dare you enter a tourney for nobly born knights?
   1178874|00000000||Your knighthood came through the grace of my mother, Meve, Queen of Lyria and Rivia - whom you treacherously deserted mere days later!
   1178876|00000000||Your presence here is an offense to my honor!
   1199989|00000000||And yours is an offence to my eyes. If you're done, step aside. Prince.
   1126315|00000000||Before us Sir Ravix of Fourhorn dubbed! His spurs flash like lightning, to a shine they've been rubbed!
   1126317|00000000||Before us Geralt, from Rivia come! Fast as the wind, bright as the sun!
   1173181|00000000||Ladies and gentlemen of lineage illustrious, soon steeds shall swarm like ants most industrious! To beat time's passage they'll ride like the gale! What a sight to behold, what a lark, what a tale!
   1126152|00000000||Accept my wishes of good fortune, sir… And devote all your strength to the tourney. And only it.
   1126154|00000000||The time has come for you, Sir Knight. Mount your steed, swift be your flight.
   1126120|00000000||The tourney's protector! The Maid Vivienne! Her beauty entrances both beasts and men!
   1126122|00000000||My heart's greetings, dear knights! May my grace guide you and show you the path of honor, valor and glory.
   1170826|00000000||Aaaaaand… he's off! With a thunderous roar, hooves pound the ground! No legion of drummers could make such a sound!
   1170837|00000000||So close! Will he last, endure and keep pace? What tension, what stress - what a marvelous race!
   1189388|00000000||Ehh… The very cream of the land's chivalry has come for the tourney.
   1196283|00000000||A bit soured, that cream… Palmerin's well past fifty summers…
   1196285|00000000||Yes, but Sir Guillaume? Oh, I would wet myself were he to choose me as his lady…
   1196287|00000000||Not you alone, for that would show he's got birdseed for brains!
   1194607|00000000||Eh?
   1194609|00000000||Tough times, oy, tough, indeed.
   1194611|00000000||Oh, I doubt her man'll ever be sober.
   1179036|00000000||Blood! Blood!
   1195458|00000000||That's him! That's the fink who killed Fourfingers!
   1195460|00000000||Crikey, it's that witcher! He slaughtered Starling Straggen's hanse!
   1195462|00000000||You dog dangle… you killed Loth Halfbreed!
   1179038|00000000||It's not allowed, that kind of beating! Feast is over!
   1179040|00000000||You reek like Lebioda's sandals!
   1179042|00000000||Dingaling, dangaling, mangaling!
   1179044|00000000||Circle him! Circle him!
   1179046|00000000||Stay together! At least try to!
   1179048|00000000||I'll avenge you, comrade!
   1179050|00000000||He's casting spells!
   1186386|d3810f9b||Wicked Witch
   1181234|00000000||Rumple my rump, where're you going?!
   1181240|00000000||There was a Beast, now there is none, and the river flows onward.
   1181242|00000000||The duquessa was, yet she is no more. The nobly born croak just as we do.
   1181238|00000000||A bum full of mushrooms means your bum's a grove of trees.
   1181244|00000000||Moddlegocks! Calm down!
   1181248|00000000||Akh hrrrk hawrrk. What now?
   1181246|00000000||Heighdie-ho, heighdie-ho, I'm about ready to blow.
   1195282|00000000||Huh?
   1195284|00000000||What?
   1195286|00000000||Yea?
   1195308|00000000||I don't give a rat's arse.
   1195288|00000000||You daft?
   1195290|00000000||Bloody hell!
   1195292|00000000||Ptooey!
   1195294|00000000||What do ya want?
   1195304|00000000||Argh…
   1195296|00000000||Hoo-wee at him!
   1195298|00000000||Together now! Kill the whoreson!
   1195300|00000000||Hit 'im! Kill 'im!
   1195302|00000000||Ploughing curses!
   1195306|00000000||Shit!
   1195310|00000000||Well, cockscuker? Sheathe it.
   1195312|00000000||Good lad.
   1195314|00000000||You're ploughin' choice, knoblicker.
    580018|d00dc371||Dockhand
   1208496|a663a0d4||Count Borhis di Salvaress
   1210450|00000000||Leave me in peace.
   1210452|00000000||A fine pickle I'm in now. Cursed schemers.
   1202234|00000000||So good to see you, witcher.
   1202236|00000000||Ah, witcher. You're always a welcome sight in my vineyard.
   1156514|00000000||Welcome! Herbs freshly-picked, dried, powdered - whatsoever your heart desires!
   1188511|00000000||Herbs, schmerbs - but how about some gwent, eh?
   1182640|00000000||Gwent - like to play?
   1156527|00000000||So long.
   1156519|00000000||Farewell.
   1156517|00000000||Mind if I have a look?
   1156521|00000000||Lemme see what you got.
   1156516|00000000||A returning customer is a satisfied customer! Come, peruse and buy!
   1188162|00000000||Hey, this would make a fine roost.
   1195894|00000000||You would have us hide out in a toy shop? Your brain's botched.
   1195896|00000000||I know what I'm talking about. Think, who'd think to look for us among a pile of dusty old gewgaws?
   1195898|00000000||Hm, you might be on to something.
   1183807|00000000||Drink, sing, have your fill of fun! Just take care not to brown your bum!
   1183809|00000000||Have you been to the Belles, Whitelocks? They've some real beauties there… not too dear, either!
   1183813|00000000||Who do you seek? Not me, I don't think!
   1183811|00000000||You're as twisted as a flagon of vinegar!
   1185975|00000000||Must be where Moreau had his lab…
   1185982|00000000||Guessing this man didn't come here willingly…
   1186180|00000000||Preserved organs… Hope their donors weren't forced to give 'em up.
   1186258|00000000||Now to combine all the ingredients…
   1186307|00000000||Intriguing as machinery goes… but how do I start it up?
   1186309|00000000||A portal, but it's shut tight. Activating crystal's gotta be around here somewhere…
   1186311|00000000||Crystal's damaged. Need to replace it with one that'll work.
   1186313|00000000||Megascope. Who knows what it'll show me once I activate it. Oughta start up if I hit it with Aard.
   1199996|00000000||Moreau must've kept his son in here. Grim.
   1199994|00000000||Empty. Wonder who was kept in here.
   1185988|00000000||Quite the library… Mostly tomes on mutations and genetics.
   1200488|00000000||Not the right eggs. Moreau mentioned the mutating ones glowing.
   1200003|00000000||Missing two crystals.
   1200007|00000000||All crystals in place. Show me what you got.
   1200009|00000000||Hmm. This crystal must go here…
   1200075|00000000||Crystals. Should mount them in the megascope.
   1200005|00000000||Missing one last crystal.
   1200447|00000000||Uh-huh. Mom's awake and she's not in a good mood.
   1200490|00000000||Mutated. Exactly what I was looking for. Now to get the machine up and running.
   1200449|00000000||Sorry. Need your eggs.
   1200453|00000000||Another one… How many of you in there?
   1200451|00000000||Come on…
   1210278|00000000||No point going in wearing full gear. Gotta drop my armor, leave my weapons.
    444254|85f9c72d||Succubus
   1191283|00000000||Hey, cocker.
   1165354|00000000||Welcome to Beauclair, City of Love!
   1165356|00000000||Here love has no price - well, not a high price, at any rate.
   1193604|00000000||If you think killing the Beast gets you in for free, you're very, very wrong!
   1165352|00000000||My eyes are up here, stranger.
   1165350|00000000||So what will it be?
   1194440|00000000||You, whaddaya want?
   1194442|00000000||You could make yourself useful.
   1194444|00000000||That mug's a fright…
   1205750|00000000||They all died on me, left me bereft, not a copper to my name…
   1191155|00000000||How do you do!
   1176175|00000000||Heartfelt greetings, truly.
   1176177|00000000||Watch out… Achoo!
   1176179|00000000||Guards! Achoo! Guards!
   1198873|00000000||Achoo! You bested the Beast! Bravo!
   1176183|00000000||Achoo! How am I to taste wine with a clogged sniffer…?
   1176181|00000000||Achoo! Fizzle-fazz!
   1176185|00000000||I shall wipe my nose on you!
   1191771|00000000||Glory and fame - just deserts for your noble deed, master witcher.
   1183126|00000000||Owww! Akh! Akh!
   1183124|00000000||Oi, Silverback - leave me be, I beg you.
   1183128|00000000||I think I've got colic. Owe, blast!
   1183130|00000000||Dunder dumplings, my sides ache something fierce…
   1208892|7859975c||Medic
   1101003|00000000||Heroic.
   1101012|00000000||Maybe I could just stand? Sword in hand?
   1101014|00000000||Ah! Splendid! A heroic pose - of course!
   1103710|00000000||The bold warrior, his sword held aloft.
   1103712|00000000||Ready to run at the… well, that willow over there. I will paint in a griffin later.
   1103714|00000000||Shall I begin? Or would you prefer to adopt another pose?
   1156314|00000000||Lemme try something else.
   1101010|00000000||Maybe something different.
   1101009|00000000||Go for it.
   1155444|00000000||Ahg, go ahead.
   1155446|00000000||Now, be so kind as to adopt that look you gave me when I first asked you to work with me…
   1155448|00000000||That… intense scowl of an angry wild ram about to butt heads.
   1155451|00000000||Yes! Excellent! Now, hold that! Do not budge!
   1101025|00000000||This gonna take much longer?
   1101027|00000000||Not much, not much at all… We'll run out of daylight soon. Please, keep your head still, in the same position.
   1101029|00000000||Fine, I'll try. I'll also try to remember to never trust a painter again.
   1101031|00000000||Griffin!
   1114558|00000000||Yeah, I know. You'll paint one in later.
   1114661|00000000||Gods! A griiiiffiiiiin!!!!
   1101033|00000000||Run! And hide!
   1163571|00000000||Dearest mummy! Aaaa!
   1163575|00000000||Dearest mummy! Aaaa!
   1163569|00000000||Dearest mummy! Aaaa!
   1101020|00000000||Go ahead.
   1101022|00000000||Now, if you wouldn't mind, that look you gave me when I first asked you to pose - would be so kind as to adopt it again?
   1103697|00000000||That intense scowl of an angry wild ram about to butt heads.
   1105478|00000000||Yes! Excellent! Now, hold that! Do not budge!
   1105111|00000000||Lemme try something else.
   1101006|00000000||How about I be on horseback. I mean, Roach kind of deserves to be immortalized, too.
   1101008|00000000||Oh, yes! A horse! Exceptional idea! But I would rather you perch atop Alexander , my mount. I've trained him to pose.
   1103691|00000000||I shall paint in the carcass of a slain griffin later. Now, raise your head to exude pride, thrust your breast forward. Go on - breast forward!
   1103693|00000000||I want to see those hocks extended! Ahem, is the horse paying attention?!
   1103695|00000000||May I begin? Or would you rather try a different pose?
   1101002|00000000||On horseback.
   1101004|00000000||Reclining.
   1101016|00000000||Think I'll lie down. Least that way I can nap while you work.
   1101018|00000000||The hero at rest, lying on his side, propped up on an elbow…
   1103716|00000000||Staring into the distance, relishing a victory… I can paint in a griffin corpse later.
   1103718|00000000||Though naturally, a nap is out of the question. We resolved that earlier.
   1103720|00000000||May I begin? Or would you prefer to strike a more dynamic pose?
   1101001|00000000||All is ready, we may begin. Have you decided on the pose you'd like to adopt?
   1115385|00000000||This the place?
   1100993|00000000||Yes! Just look at the view - breathtaking! The perfect background for our masterpiece.
   1100995|00000000||Mhm. Pretty, I guess.
   1100997|00000000||Now, you must carefully consider in what pose you wish to be immortalized.
   1100999|00000000||All right. Considering.
   1117446|00000000||Listen, got this contract I need to finish before the brew wears off.
   1126539|00000000||Right, monster won't slay itself. Let me see. First up, I need to know what we're dealing with.
   1170126|00000000||Follow me. And try not to trample any plants or small animals.
   1117431|00000000||Need to track down this wraith. Let's go.
   1117435|00000000||Hey, why do you always show up when I whistle?
   1117442|00000000||Hey, know how you always show up when I whistle? How's that work, exactly?
   1126488|00000000||Well, you're my human. Gotta be there when you need me. Yes, I'll be there for you-ou-ou, as the world falls down.
   1142909|00000000||Still kinda strange - how you cross the ocean when I call sometimes, but then get hung up on the tiniest fence. What's that about?
   1142911|00000000||What can I say? Everyone's got limits.
   1117437|00000000||Must be the brew that did this. Interesting side effect…
   1126360|00000000||Great, isn't it? You should take this stuff more often - got so many pointers I could give you!
   1126364|00000000||Can't, sadly. Drinking this too often could prove fatal.
   1142069|00000000||I can understand you. Seems the mushrooms did this.
   1142070|00000000||Um, why do you sound so manly?
   1142903|00000000||Your voice, it's, uh, interesting. Gotta say I expected a young mare to sound, uh, girlish.
   1142905|00000000||Based on what? Your vast experience with talking animals? Far as I know, I'm your first.
   1142907|00000000||Good point.
   1191751|00000000||Don't see no wraith.
   1117424|00000000||Mmm, wow… this clover's amazing. Now that's what I call a bouquet.
   1117428|00000000||Who said that?
   1117426|00000000||Oh, you're awake. Had me worried, you were out way too long. Even considered giving you some White Honey. Kinda hard to do with hooves, though.
   1126108|00000000||Roach…?
   1207979|00000000||Geralt was as intrigued as I was, and as I imagine you shall be, to learn higher vampire society is organized in a strict hierarchy based on age: the older a vampire, the greater his say in their matters and the stricter the punishment for going against his will. One extremely elder vampire lived in Beauclair, in the cave where he had been deposited during the Conjunction of the Spheres. Geralt and Regis decided they had to go see him to get his help in finding Dettlaff.<br><br>The only problem was that the more ancient members of the vampiric race were not very… how to put this… amenable to company. This particular elder so deeply disliked visitors Regis trembled at the very thought of having to disturb his peace. Geralt had a difficult decision to make: should he risk a visit to the Elder’s domain, or try to find Syanna?<br>
   1207980|00000000||Regis’ reservations about visiting the Unseen Elder were not at all unfounded. Though in the end Geralt was able to convince this being to help, he almost had to pay with his own and Regis’ lives. Luckily, however, all ended well and Geralt and Regis left the Elder’s cave alive and unharmed (though perhaps a little shaken up), with a guarantee Dettlaff would soon meet them at Tesham Mutna.
   1207978|00000000||The Unseen Elder
   1205389|0001be4b||Catfish
   1196289|00000000||Greetings.
   1196291|00000000||Ah, if only I was healthy.
   1196293|00000000||Leg it!
   1181529|00000000||This is not the best time for chit-chat, Geralt.
   1181531|00000000||We must focus on Damien. Time's running out.
   1172278|00000000||Hurry. Damien could be in danger.
   1172280|00000000||Or dead.
   1176562|00000000||Do you think so? He seemed battle-hardened, more than a few scraps under his belt…
   1176564|00000000||Against humans, not monsters.
   1172282|00000000||Look. There.
   1172284|00000000||We must put him down before he kills again.
   1172286|00000000||Never thought lesser vampires would heed a higher vampire's call and commands.
   1179266|00000000||As a rule, they don’t.
   1179268|00000000||So how'd Dettlaff sic them on the city?
   1172288|00000000||I told you. He's exceptional. He manages to bend them to his will, control them with his thoughts.
   1185337|00000000||They'll continue attacking until he orders them to back down - or until he dies.
   1172290|00000000||It's a massacre…
   1172292|00000000||Monster's still here.
   1173347|00000000||They should not have come out to fight. They'd have done better to stay inside, behind locked doors and barred windows..
   1173349|00000000||And sat there, listening to the screams of the dying?
   1173004|00000000||Need to look around.
   1173087|00000000||Armor proved useless. Claws sliced through steel like through butter.
   1173089|00000000||We must hurry. Each moment's delay means another death.
   1173091|00000000||Blow itself didn't kill him… Bled to death afterwards.
   1173093|00000000||If we'd only arrived a bit earlier…
   1173341|00000000||They broke formation. Ran.
   1173343|00000000||*Sniff* That scent… It's Damien's blood. He was wounded.
   1173345|00000000||Let's go.
   1173382|00000000||Fell on his face, struck in the back… Tried to run.
   1173384|00000000||They must have realized they could not hold this position.
   1176577|00000000||Hope they found a corner to hide in. Won't be anyone to talk to if not.
   1173387|00000000||Must be in the bank. Barricaded themselves inside.
   1173389|00000000||The door won't hold up long. Let's get to work.
   1175255|00000000||Barricade put up in the street…
   1175257|00000000||Pointless. That's no obstacle to a vampire.
   1175259|00000000||They didn't know. I didn't get a chance to prepare them.
   1180708|00000000||Gotta signal Regis, have him join me…
   1180720|00000000||Tell Regis to meet me in the palace. We need to get to the playroom.
   1181520|00000000||Geralt? Care to come back?
   1173085|00000000||Hm. He didn't suffer long, at least.
   1173083|00000000||Another one… dammit.
   1173000|00000000||Damien? Damien!
   1173002|00000000||No answer… but he's not among the dead, either…
   1184459|34a42100||Art Patron
   1173845|00000000||So this is the tracker… A witcher, yes?
   1173940|00000000||Indeed, this is him. We found the body together. Then he set off in pursuit of the killer…
   1173943|00000000||And ended up here, but I've only found evidence of a fight… Seems the Cintrian's killed his last, finally failed this time. Shame it happened too late for Cecilia.
   1173945|00000000||Poor girl… Always told her she chose her males badly… But I would never have suspected she could arrive with a murderer.
   1173948|00000000||I'll alert the staff, have them see to her body at once… Meanwhile, we should sit. I will tell you everything. In full detail.
   1174460|00000000||Think your sister might be involved? Why?
   1174466|00000000||You see… I recall her always being rather… possessive, throwing jealous fits if I had something she didn't.
   1174468|00000000||Hear that's normal for sisters - rivalry…
   1174470|00000000||True… I suppose I gave as good as I got. There are times I miss that very much.
   1176336|00000000||The wine, its theft, was the first clue. That's very much like her - she always did enjoy stealing my toys.
   1174472|00000000||But I grew almost certain when I saw the Heart of Toussaint. Syanna received it from Father as a gift. At a time when my parents thought of her as but an ill-behaved little girl.
   1198146|00000000||Someone wanted some of my wine. The same someone ordered our family jewel stolen - or recovered. It's my sister, it must be.
   1174474|00000000||A fallen princess satisfying whims, going after lost luxuries… Hm, could be right.
   1174402|00000000||Think she's involved?
   1174433|00000000||Why was she banished?
   1194876|00000000||What'd your sister do to get banished?
   1194878|00000000||Syanna was… cursed.
   1194880|00000000||Parents run afoul of some mage?
   1194882|00000000||No. She was born at an inopportune moment. They said she was touched by the Curse of the Black Sun… Geralt, is it true? Can an individual be evil because they were born during the wrong lunar phase?
   1194884|00000000||Could be the case. Could also be because they were treated like lepers from birth - isolated, prodded, ostracized. Couldn't have had it easy, Syanna.
   1194886|00000000||She… she was angry at the whole world. She felt inferior, felt pain, though she masked this with confidence, arrogance, even. She could also be cruel at times.
   1194888|00000000||I recall one such situation… She persuaded Cedric de Coulbert that she could see the future in her dreams.
   1194890|00000000||We were children, and Cedric's brother was smitten with me. It was an innocent childhood crush.
   1194892|00000000||Syanna knew of it. She told Cedric of a dream she had had - that he would die… at the hands of his own brother.
   1194894|00000000||Cedric stole his father's sword and killed his brother. She destroyed two lives with the prank - Cedric mourns to this day.
   1194896|00000000||In the end, they forced her to leave the palace… A decade past, more. I've missed her terribly since.
   1174504|00000000||Can't promise anything.
   1174508|00000000||Can't guarantee her safety, unfortunately. Especially if she's one of those responsible for these crimes.
   1175622|00000000||Witcher, that was not a request.
   1174770|00000000||That surprise you?
   1174776|00000000||Seem surprised. Why?
   1174778|00000000||I never would've suspected Regis to find common ground with… a witcher.
   1174798|00000000||Just like humans.
   1174804|00000000||Same as humans. Put them in that situation, they'll kill, too.
   1174806|00000000||You understand this… It must be why you and Regis are friends.
   1198215|00000000||It stands along the Sansretour River, near the Cockatrice Inn.
   1198211|00000000||Captain de la Tour and his men will await you there at midnight. You shall storm the castle together.
   1198217|00000000||I know the place.
   1174899|00000000||Didn't expect the evening to end like this.
   1174901|00000000||Neither did I… But I have not drawn you out for a romantic stroll. I wish to make certain you know what you are to do.
   1174903|00000000||Mhm. Gotta go to Dun Tynne.
   1174905|00000000||I've decided my guardsmen will support you. You will meet them at Count de la Croix's mill.
   1174888|00000000||Interesting evening all around.
   1174889|00000000||He tell you much about himself?
   1174891|00000000||Don't know him too well. He say much about himself?
   1174893|00000000||Not much, but I've a good sense of the true nature of those I meet. I'd not survive a week at court otherwise.
   1174895|00000000||So what's his?
   1174897|00000000||Sensitive. Sad. He carries within him the weight of a terrible tragedy. He is a good man, but lost. Which is why he comes across as grim.
   1174887|00000000||You have exceptional friends. This Dettlaff - an intriguing man to say the least.
   1174867|00000000||Splendidly, Dettlaff. Ah, I'm grateful you brought back those memories.
   1174869|00000000||You're back. It took you long enough.
   1174871|00000000||Contrary to what common folk believe, choosing a wine is not nearly as easy as it might seem. Especially a wine to be served to two exquisite ladies.
   1174873|00000000||Regis - gallant as ever.
   1174875|00000000||I regret all the more that I shan't finish this second bottle with you. Duty calls…
   1174879|00000000||Your Grace, always a pleasure.
   1174881|00000000||I thank you for your help, it's been invaluable… Geralt, will you see me out?
   1174839|00000000||Now listen close. Managed to learn where the blackmailers are. They're based at Dun Tynne Castle.
   1174841|00000000||That's splendid news. If they are there, Rhena must be there as well.
   1174843|00000000||Duchess expects we'll find her long-lost sister there, too. Thing is, she might be involved, could be behind the blackmailing.
   1174845|00000000||Do you mean to say your task now is to extract two women from the castle?
   1174847|00000000||Mean to say we can't breathe a word of this to Dettlaff. Who wants revenge above all else.
   1174849|00000000||Geralt, you must trust me. I've got a way with--
   1174851|00000000||No, Regis. Can't risk it. Gotta keep Dettlaff here while I go to Dun Tynne.
   1174853|00000000||Alone?
   1174855|00000000||Alone. That way I can make sure neither woman'll come to any harm.
   1174857|00000000||I hope you know what you're doing… Fine. I shall see to Dettlaff. Good luck, my friend.
   1174204|00000000||I know where the blackmailers are.
   1174830|00000000||Orianna… she really your friend? Can she be trusted?
   1174832|00000000||I met her years ago, before I met you. And before she settled in Beauclair. We'd not seen one another in, oh - I can't begin to tell you in how long.
   1174836|00000000||But I shall tell you all about her… some other day.
   1174205|00000000||Orianna - how do you know her?
   1174212|00000000||Seriously just a coincidence, you stopping by?
   1174214|00000000||Guessing it's no accident you two stopped by…
   1174216|00000000||It would be quite some coincidence, indeed… No, a dutiful little bird told us.
   1174218|00000000||Mhm…
   1189169|00000000||You crazy? Bringing Dettlaff here?
   1189171|00000000||Geralt, allow me to explain…
   1189173|00000000||No, let me explain. He's dangerous - and you were gonna watch him.
   1189194|00000000||But that is precisely what I'm doing. Dettlaff believes you'll succeed in your task. And he'll not need to kill anymore…
   1189196|00000000||That is, not until he gets his hands on the men who kidnapped his Rhena.
   1174207|00000000||An exceptional conversation, don't you think? Vampires, a witcher and the duchess of Toussaint - my, my.
   1174209|00000000||Highly exceptional, Regis… Wanted to talk to you in private.
   1174808|00000000||If I understand you correctly, you would rather help a monster than kill it?
   1174810|00000000||If possible, yeah. Or at least try.
   1174814|00000000||Enough about the witcher trade for now… Regis mentioned you come from Nazair. I spent time there as a child.
   1174816|00000000||Fond memories?
   1174818|00000000||It was wonderful. I was positively entranced by the land's fashions. Deep cut dresses I found most fascinating…
   1174821|00000000||I believe we're running short on wine. I should go to the cellar, bring another bottle.
   1174822|00000000||Let me go. Wanna help, Regis? Know your wine a lot better than I know mine.
   1174825|00000000||We shall return forthwith.
   1174800|00000000||That's no excuse. There's always a way out, another solution. Seeking help, for instance.
   1174802|00000000||These other solutions often come too late.
   1194603|00000000||You're well aware there are men… and witchers… who have done worse in defense of their loved ones? Am I right, Geralt?
   1174797|00000000||That's no excuse.
   1174780|00000000||Don't be fooled, dear. Geralt has many merits. He merely hides them from the world very diligently.
   1174782|00000000||Mhm. You said you're both aiding him with his contract. It involves the Beast of Beauclair, I suspect?
   1174785|00000000||Master witcher, maybe you could satisfy my curiosity. What's it like, going toe to toe with a monster? Knowing you've only two options - to kill or be killed?
   1174787|00000000||Despite what you might've heard, I don't lunge at every monster I see, sword in hand. Talking gets the job done for some.
   1174789|00000000||Hmm. I wonder what a monster might have to say to you.
   1174791|00000000||It might want to apologize.
   1174794|00000000||My word. For what might a monster wish to apologize to a witcher?
   1174796|00000000||For killing. Though at times there is no choice. When loved ones are at risk and require protection.
   1174772|00000000||Few I can rely on like I can on Regis. Kinda hoping he thinks the same of me.
   1174774|00000000||Curious… It seems opposites really do attract.
   1174769|00000000||All true.
   1174538|00000000||Your Grace, Geralt, I'd like to introduce…
   1174540|00000000||Regis! What a surprise, I had no idea you were in Beauclair. And this is…?
   1174542|00000000||Uh, my very dear friend, Dettlaff van der Eretein, an arrival from Nazair. We are lending our combined resources to the witcher's hunt.
   1174544|00000000||Ah, yes, splendid… But why are you here, at Orianna's?
   1174550|00000000||They came to pay me a surprise visit, so I invited Regis in for a glass of wine. We've known each other for… ooh, ages, literally.
   1174768|00000000||Witcher, I hear you know Regis, too? Even that you are… friends.
   1194410|00000000||I'll find her if she's there.
   1194412|00000000||I hope you do. I very much wish to talk to her… sister to sister.
   1174503|00000000||I'll see to it.
   1174500|00000000||Your mission has gained new import. You must go to Dun Tynne and if Syanna is there, you must find her.
   1174502|00000000||No matter what she did, she is not to be harmed in any way, shape or form. You must make sure of that.
   1174401|00000000||My sister, Syanna, might be among the schemers.
   1174426|00000000||She left court when we were children… My parents banished her from the duchy. I've not seen her since.
   1174230|00000000||The drawing - it's on the same type of paper the victims' names were written on. Drawn with the same ink, too. Seems the work of our blackmailers.
   1174255|00000000||Who were not only behind the Beast's murders, but also stole the Sangreal and sought to steal the Heart of Toussaint…
   1185038|00000000||Look, the wine, the jewel - both tied to you, intrinsically. Coincidence? Not something I'm willing to believe.
   1185041|00000000||Worried about one thing - that somewhere at the end of this scheme, plan might call for an attempt on your life.
   1185330|00000000||It… it could be something else altogether.
   1176151|00000000||Something familiar about the drawing.
   1176152|00000000||What do you think about Orianna?
   1176154|00000000||Orianna - any thoughts?
   1176156|00000000||Few make me feel awkward, but in her presence, I sense anxiety, discomfort.
   1174185|00000000||Orianna, everything we discussed here, hope you'll keep it to yourself. Counting on it, in fact.
   1174191|00000000||Word gets out he, uh, failed in his attempt to steal the jewel, his employer could run. We need to proceed cautiously.
   1174193|00000000||Discretion is in the interest of us all. I'll not ask what this is about, just as I expect not to be troubled about it again, by anyone.
   1174248|00000000||Ahem… Forgive me. Madame Orianna, but might I have a word?
   1174250|00000000||You must excuse me a moment…
   1173967|00000000||Need to investigate, see what's there.
   1174001|00000000||Dun Tynne - what's that?
   1174175|00000000||Dun Tynne… Remember the place. Abandoned ruin just a few years ago.
   1174177|00000000||More recently the family's last heir, Roderick, returned to his ancestral seat and restored the castle.
   1174179|00000000||Know any more about this Roderick?
   1174181|00000000||His grandfather was an advisor to Queen Ademarta. The family received those lands as a grant for his service.
   1176127|00000000||Roderick is quite the recluse. He avoids society, preferring the company of a small team of knights… Though the latter term is imprecise, as they seem more akin to vandals with crests on their shields.
   1173996|00000000||Jewel seems important. Why?
   1176102|00000000||The Heart is an heirloom, it belonged to my family for years… Then it disappeared. I didn't think we would ever recover it.
   1173998|00000000||Seems someone is very determined to find it. The thief left his tool bag behind. Found this drawing inside it. Look.
   1174169|00000000||The Heart of Toussaint. Representation's pretty faithful. Cintrian must've been on a job… got very clear instructions what to look for.
   1200045|00000000||So… so it is not him we seek, but his employer.
   1174171|00000000||Is this the only evidence we've found?
   1174173|00000000||Also happened on the weapon he attacked Orianna with. Hunting knife, used to skin game. Got an emblem on its hilt…
   1184476|00000000||This crest is used by the lords of Dun Tynne. The present master of the castle is a passionate hunter… Our next lead, perhaps?
   1176085|00000000||What makes this jewel so important?
   1174162|00000000||None too wise, picking a fight with an armed robber.
   1174166|00000000||Why? Because I am a woman? In a frock, rather than plate? I can take care of myself, I assure you.
   1196049|00000000||A hairpin might look like mere ornament… but plunged into an eye, it can be as effective as a blade.
   1174000|00000000||Imprudent, attacking him…
   1173964|00000000||Thief - think I know what he was after.
   1173982|00000000||Claim the man was trying to rob you when you walked into the room?
   1173986|00000000||Yes, he stood over my dressing table, pawing through my jewelry…
   1183642|00000000||Mhm. After this, is my guess. Picked it up while searching.
   1173990|00000000||Why, that's the Heart of Toussaint! Orianna, how did you ever come to have it?
   1174259|00000000||I bought it. Many years ago. From a young woman.
   1173951|00000000||I caught him red-handed, attempting to burgle, rifling through my possessions.
   1183594|00000000||What did you do? Summon the guards?
   1183596|00000000||There was no time. I feared he'd escape, refused to give him the chance. He stood with his back to me, so I attacked.
   1196041|00000000||He struck his head on a picture frame as we struggled. He was bleeding, dazed… and then he drew a knife.
   1196043|00000000||Everythin' happened very quickly then. I knocked the weapon out of his hand and pushed him, hard. He--
   1173953|00000000||Fell out of the window.
   1173955|00000000||Just so.
   1171518|00000000||Here of your own free will, Stefan? Or did they lock you up, too?
   1188858|00000000||Bet you're thinking about food, what you'll eat once you're free.
   1188860|00000000||Mutton leg, that's what I'm dreaming of. Well-roasted on the outside, nice and juicy in the middle…
   1150161|00000000||Are you the lout from Rivia?
   1150163|00000000||Yep, I'm that lout.
   1150165|00000000||Come with me. You're to be sentenced.
   1150167|00000000||To what?
   1150169|00000000||To shut it. What am I, the town crier? Hands behind your back.
   1159468|00000000||Now let's go. And no funny business.
   1184156|00000000||Get many customers out here?
   1184158|00000000||How 'bout that - kill a basilisk and trade blossoms. Get a lot of customers in these wilds?
   1184160|00000000||Not many, true. But nor is there much competition.
   1184162|00000000||Got it. Enjoying your status as a monopolist?
   1184164|00000000||One could put it thus… if one wished me ill.
   1152098|00000000||Like you to craft something for me.
   1152093|00000000||Craft something for me, will you?
   1152100|00000000||So long.
   1152094|00000000||So long.
   1152092|00000000||What do you got on offer?
   1152096|00000000||Show me what you have in stock?
   1152091|00000000||Is it new armor you desire? Or do you wish your old set refurbished, repaired?
   1166083|00000000||I suggest we postpone any further discussion.
   1166085|00000000||More searching and less chatting, Geralt, please.
   1188868|00000000||Grette, you up for a plough?
   1188870|00000000||I'm not Grette.
   1188872|00000000||That's not what I asked!
   1123263|64fc1130||Foreman Pafnuzio
   1193855|00000000||Salutations.
   1193857|00000000||Yes?
   1193859|00000000||Hm.
   1193861|00000000||Oh!
   1193863|00000000||Don't do anything stupid!
   1193865|00000000||Mercy!
   1193867|00000000||My health - it's all I ask for.
   1193869|00000000||Oh, lovely trifles…
   1198180|00000000||But my dear…
   1198182|00000000||I refuse! There are insects everywhere! And I shall soil my dress!
   1198184|00000000||We must win!
   1198186|00000000||We must no such thing!
   1199143|00000000||Bear with me, darling. Just a bit longer.
   1198189|00000000||Have you noticed all the guardsmen in the gardens?
   1198191|00000000||Is something afoot, do you think?
   1198193|00000000||It's a possibility. We must keep a keen eye on them.
   1198201|00000000||Is the game to your liking, ladies?
   1198203|00000000||Aren't we Lord Curious-trousers!
   1198205|00000000||Our mama told us not to talk to strangers.
   1198207|00000000||But there, just there, we made our acquaintances, did we not?
   1198219|00000000||My humble opinion? De Peyrac-Peyran did nothing to deserve the honor of playing the Hare.
   1198221|00000000||They say the duquessa has donned quite the avant-garde dress.
   1198223|00000000||My favorite aspect of the Hare Hunt? The opportunities it affords to bond, rub elbows and other regions.
   1198225|00000000||I must say, King Cormorant - someone had quite the idea. Have you seen his costume?
   1198227|00000000||I'm quite curious who will win the hunt this year.
   1198229|00000000||Diving! Who had that idea?! It's in poor taste.
   1198231|00000000||I was a hair's breadth from victory last year.
   1198233|00000000||Alicorn did splendidly.
   1198235|00000000||Where could he possibly have tucked himself away…?!
   1198237|00000000||Hound's blood…
   1198195|00000000||Then we've to look by the water.
   1198197|00000000||No nooks there, where one could hide.
   1198199|00000000||Those are our orders.
   1171980|00000000||Hm. Inscription's in Elder Speech… "Salvation lies not in Dol Naev'de, but in our hearts. Glory be to Aelirenn."
   1171984|00000000||Damn. Professor's journal's long gone. Guess somebody else found out about it, too…
   1171996|00000000||Should look around, see if I can find something else…
   1172626|00000000||Footprints. Narrow and shallow - somebody small, light. Woman, maybe? Wonder where they lead.
   1172628|00000000||Dammit, trail breaks off. Wonder if the grave robber learned more than I did…
   1208601|00000000||Mh, won't learn anything else here. Map Triss sent me'll have to do.
   1208599|00000000||Mh, won't learn anything else here. Map Yen sent me'll have to do.
   1206281|00000000||Also, epitaph mentioned both Aelirenn and Dol Naev'de, Valley of the Nine.
   1208603|00000000||Hmm… Site marked on the map's all wet now. Sansretour flows through there. Must be where the Valley of the Nine once lay. Need to explore the location.
   1171982|00000000||Professor certainly can't do much to help me with my search…
   1187370|00000000||Tsk, tsk, tsk!
   1198662|00000000||Hah! Sounds like pure chicken spittle!
   1198660|00000000||What a tale…
   1187376|00000000||The Beast was - the Beast is no more.
   1187378|00000000||But for one sister to do that to another…?
   1200394|00000000||Just yesterday they were fighting like cats, and today? They're in business together!
   1198895|00000000||Cat-piddled Coronata…
   1187374|00000000||The days pass, the pile of work remains the same…
   1187372|00000000||And what do you get for all that work? A crook in your back once you're on in years…
   1187380|00000000||Help! Help me!
   1198666|00000000||When the witcher caught Loth Halfbreed - you know, the guttersnipe who botched Fox Hollow - he tore him apart, bare-handed!
   1198664|00000000||They say the miller's son ran off to join Starling Straggen's hanse. And remember what a good lad he was?
   1198668|00000000||That spriggan that slaughtered the Cutterins - apparently it was forced to do it. Foul magic worked by the daughter's suitor. All on account of him being refused her hand!
   1187384|00000000||Yeaaaah?
   1187382|00000000||Good day, good day…
   1170156|00000000||Sir, sir! A letter for you, sir!
   1170158|00000000||Letter? Who from?
   1170160|00000000||Can't rightly say, sir. I was just to deliver it.
   1170164|00000000||Here, your tip.
   1170502|00000000||Here. And thanks.
   1170504|00000000||No, sir, thank you! And I truly hope I'll be of service again!
   1170511|00000000||"My Dear Geralt…"
   1170513|00000000||I hope all is well. I imagine you hot on the trail of some nasty monster - or is it an overly complex curse this time? Oh Geralt, I wish I knew for certain…
   1185307|00000000||Whatever is keeping you busy, perhaps you'll need a break. For those moments I offer you this intriguing little mystery I happened on in an old manuscript I bought off a merchant from Nazair.
   1185309|00000000||The tome's author claims a certain Professor Moreau once called Beauclair home. And this professor conducted research into witcher mutations.
   1185311|00000000||I don't know much else, but I suspect that alone might pique your interest. The tome mentioned a journal interred with the scholar when he passed. It could very well lead you to his laboratory.
   1208595|00000000||I'm enclosing a map I found folded in the tome. It's smudged in a few places, but I hope it proves useful anyway.
   1185313|00000000||Please be careful and come back to me quickly. Your Triss.
   1170518|00000000||"My Dear Friend…"
   1170520|00000000||I've been told you're on a jaunt to Toussaint. I do hope you don't overtax yourself during the Wine Festival. The effects of such exertion at your age can indeed prove most detrimental.
   1185173|00000000||I've come upon some information which might be of interest to you. While browsing through a colleague's book collection, I found mention of one Professor Moreau, of Beauclair, who conducted research into witcher mutations.
   1185186|00000000||The details I've come to learn are rather vague and his laboratory's location remains a mystery. Yet his journal should at least provide hints as to both. It is said he was laid to rest with it in his tomb.
   1208593|00000000||I enclose a map I found in the tome I happened upon. Though less than completely legible, I trust it will prove useful nonetheless.
   1185188|00000000||Should you grow tired of sampling Beauclair's ladies, wines and other exquisite delicacies, this matter might prove a fruitful diversion. Investigate at your leisure. Your friend, Yennefer.
   1170524|00000000||Hm. A professor who studied witcher mutations… Might actually be worth looking into.
   1170514|00000000||"Dearest,"
   1170516|00000000||I suspect weighty affairs, rather than merely the Wine Festival, have drawn you to Toussaint. Perhaps you'll find time to probe a certain matter in spite of this.
   1185217|00000000||I recently came across the mention of one Professor Moreau, a scholar in Beauclair who conducted research into witcher mutations.
   1185257|00000000||Though the details are rather murky, as is the location of the scholar's laboratory, his journal could contain more information. It lies buried with him in his tomb.
   1208597|00000000||I enclose a map I found in the tome I happened upon. Though less than completely legible, I trust it will prove useful nonetheless.
   1185275|00000000||I felt this matter could prove of some importance to you, thus I dispatched this letter without delay. Whatever you decide, please take exceedingly good care of yourself. Your Yen.
   1170500|00000000||See what it says here? "Postage Paid." Won't weasel any coin out of me. Now scram.
   1185163|00000000||I knew I should've wiped dirt on that stamp… Bumbotch.
   1170163|00000000||Stamp says "postage paid," so get lost.
   1165444|00000000||Try one of the other chaps.
   1165442|00000000||Sorry, friend, I'm just here for the ladies.
   1165446|00000000||Drunk women - so easy to make them come, so hard to make them go home.
   1165448|00000000||A full night's pleasure for the price of a mere evening. Best deal in town!
   1100910|00000000||A work of mine, "Turtle Dove O'er the Heath," hangs in the ducal palace.
   1100912|00000000||So does a cockatrice I cut down once. It's stuffed - maybe even with heather.
   1100914|00000000||I once had a cockatrice feather brush.
   1100916|00000000||Best thing for laying down tempera.
   1100918|00000000||I no longer have it, sadly. My blasted cat swiped it!
   1105038|00000000||Why would a cat want a brush?
   1105040|00000000||To paint with, of course. And it was no common brush. Fantastic, as I said. And fantastically expensive.
   1105042|00000000||Hang on. Got a cat that paints?
   1105044|00000000||Ugh! If you care to call it that! He merely copies the works of his betters. And poorly, at that.
   1105046|00000000||Your cat?
   1105048|00000000||Yes. Pierre-Auguste Moustacherois. It's no surprise you've not heard of him. He's a second-rate hack. And a thief.
   1163385|00000000||You look like a withered winky on a gray muff.
   1163383|00000000||What's the problem, you gray boot wipe?
   1163387|00000000||Too slow, grayboy!
   1163389|00000000||You're slower than cold poo rolling uphill…
   1163391|00000000||Ehh, bog off with that!
   1193430|00000000||Hey, there!
   1049787|6c3c7e75||Wyvern
   1207168|311c6956||Billy Goat
   1191867|00000000||Pardon me.
   1191869|00000000||Aaaah!
   1084298|4a51c663||Warg
   1208647|00000000||<i>Blood on the ceiling, guts on the walls… Must be a garkain.</i><br> – Yan of Lan Exeter, investigator and Captain of the City Watch<br><br>Garkains, like fleders, belong to the class of particularly dangerous vampires whose strength exceeds even that of fiends. An encounter with one of their number almost always ends in death, which is why there are not many eye-witness accounts of them. From the city guard reports written up in Lan Exeter describing the attacks committed in that city in 1104 by three garkains (later killed by a certain Olivier of Gulet, witcher), it seems these horrible monsters do not content themselves with drinking the blood of their victims. The investigators concluded from the blood and guts strewn around the crime scenes that garkains tear their victims to shreds with great delight and muck about in their bloody entrails.<br>
   1208648|00000000||Garkains belong to the group of creatures known as lesser vampires. They often gather around themselves members of other subspecies of lesser vampires, acting in such situations as leaders of the pack. They are by and large unable to run, but can jump a great distance and often attack their prey in that way. During combat, they usually keep their distance from their foes, trying to incapacitate them using a blast of mental energy provoking visions that beguile and disorient.<br><br>Before grappling a garkain, one should drink the Black Blood potion and stock up on vampire oil. It should also be remembered that the Samum and Moon Dust bombs are always effective weapons against any mental attacks.
   1176357|00000000||Garkains
   1105823|00000000||You've changed your mind, have you? Shan't regret it, you'll see. You need but do what you always do, while I write and sing of it.
   1208007|00000000||Geralt! So content to see you! Le Papillon, troubadour - remember?
   1208009|00000000||Hey there.
   1208930|00000000||I've never found the opportune moment, see, never had a chance, in fact, to say I'm a devoted fan…
   1208001|00000000||Ravix of Fourhorn! So content to see you! Le Papillon, troubadour - remember?
   1208003|00000000||Hey there. Know what? The… whole… Ravix thing. Only ever a joke. Call me Geralt, please.
   1208005|00000000||Geralt of Rivia? Naturally! How did it ever escape me?! You must know I'm a devoted fan…
   1208932|00000000||Hm, thanks.
   1208934|00000000||…of Master Dandelion! I know the bard's every ballad in his cycle about the witcher. Oh, I cannot believe my luck!
   1105649|00000000||Need something - from me?
   1105651|00000000||Indeed - a matter most magnificent. My coiffeur, Jean-Louis Ludovic, has gone missing! Now you shall rescue him, while I compose an epic ballad about it!
   1105653|00000000||Listen, fair folk, to a glorious tale, of a missing friseur and a witcher who'd prevail!
   1092749|00000000||The coiffeur - tell me something about him.
   1092752|00000000||What happened, exactly? Claim the hairdresser's missing - but're you sure?
   1092754|00000000||Yes, yes, I've no doubt something's transpired, something terrible, absurd! Jean-Louis's never late to work - he's punctual to a fault.
   1092756|00000000||I'm certain he'll be honored if I am the one to sing of his dramatic rescue.
   1162602|00000000||Yes, by all means. As you wish.
   1208011|00000000||Her Grace can be as fickle as the colts she rides. Today, all remember my fine couplets at the tourney. Yet tomorrow, Her Illustriousness, bored by her breakfast, might demand a new epic poem. One most grab at opportunity before it flits away.
   1143294|00000000||Well, then - where shall we start?
   1143296|00000000||At the door. By breaking it down.
   1201188|00000000||Her Illustriousness was always so very kind to me. My poem I've decided to dedicate to her martyrdom.
   1143299|00000000||Fine, see what I can learn. Now, if you have to come with me, just one request - stay out of the way. Mine and my sword's.
   1143301|00000000||Of course, you shan't even notice me. Jean-Louis' studio is just there, right here. Aaaaaagh!
   1143303|00000000||What's the matter?
   1143305|00000000||I've hit upon the perfect ending - "And all for the glory of Her Grace, the Duchess"!
   1143307|00000000||Thought this was about a witcher and a coiffeur. What's the duchess got to do with it?
   1105910|00000000||Fine. I'll look into it.
   1162596|00000000||Farewell.
   1162604|00000000||See you.
   1092882|00000000||No chance. Got my hands full with just one screwy troubadour in my life.
   1092884|00000000||You've an exclusivity contract with Dandelion - is that it?
   1105821|00000000||Something along those lines. So long.
   1092750|00000000||Not gonna happen.
   1105656|00000000||Who's gonna pay me?
   1105658|00000000||Who's gonna pay me to find this barber?
   1105660|00000000||I will. Such opportunities come knocking rarely. But you must take me with you, for I must transcribe all that occurs as it happens.
   1211310|00000000||Fine, but… unusual as contracts go. It'll cost you more.
   1211312|00000000||Naturally. To be expected.
   1150309|00000000||Coulda happened to anyone.
   1150289|00000000||What can I say… It happens at times. Especially likely to when the monster I'm chasing can turn into fog.
   1149506|00000000||Working on it.
   1149517|00000000||We're working to find that out, Your Grace.
   1149519|00000000||Do you take me for a fool?
   1149521|00000000||I… wouldn't dare--
   1149523|00000000||I care not one whit what you have worked on, are working on or shall work on. I'm interested in results. Which, thus far, have been nil.
   1149540|00000000||Maybe you should summon your beagles, then.
   1149543|00000000||Then perhaps Your Grace should've sent a beagle instead of a witcher after the vampire.
   1149547|00000000||You tread on thin ice, witcher. Very thin. Wisdom demands you choose your words more cautiously.
   1149541|00000000||Vampires and foxes, game in general, exhibit certain essential differences.
   1149549|00000000||Allow me to point out certain subtle but essential differences between a higher vampire and a fox, or game in general.
   1149553|00000000||Truly? Like the ones between a pathetic quip and a treasonous offense? Watch your words, witcher.
   1180260|00000000||If it's war this Dettlaff wants, it's war he shall have.
   1180262|00000000||Geralt, get to work. This time I'll hear no excuses. Palmerin, you--
   1180265|00000000||Get her out of here!
   1158742|00000000||But to the matter at hand. Have you managed to establish anything?
   1158744|00000000||Your Grace, it seems Syanna tricked Dettlaff, used him to murder the knights who escorted her into exile. We have reason to believe that--
   1149674|00000000||Your Grace… Vampires!
   1149676|00000000||What? Speak, now!
   1149678|00000000||Vampires… they've attacked the city… Captain de la Tour defends the square near the boat landing… but… so many lives lost…
   1175716|00000000||Dammit.
   1150439|00000000||We'll catch him, Your Grace. Sooner or later.
   1150441|00000000||I should hope so, witcher. For the sake of all Beauclair. And yours.
   1150427|00000000||We'll find him, sooner or later.
   1149537|00000000||Ahh. At times I hunt foxes. Do you know how it works? The Ducal Huntsman releases the hounds. They catch the fox's scent, chase the animal down, and lead the battue to it - all within an hour.
   1149539|00000000||You, witcher, have had a week. The aid of my most excellent knights. Yet you have tracked absolutely nothing down.
   1150420|00000000||I've begun to suspect my beagles might have done a better job.
   1149509|00000000||Don't know. I lost his trail.
   1149511|00000000||Is this all you have to say?
   1149513|00000000||I respect Your Grace. All I can say is the truth.
   1149505|00000000||Don't know.
   1149500|00000000||Your Grace, the population demands she be punished. Syanna's committed terrible crimes, spilled so much blood. They--
   1149502|00000000||Another word, Palmerin, and I shall spill even more blood. Yours.
   1149504|00000000||I repeat for the last time, Syanna is responsible for the death of many, true… but she is also my sister. We are bound by blood and by a shared childhood. I shall not allow her to be lynched.
   1175692|00000000||Your Grace, I fear the masses might rise, storm the prison, pitchforks and torches in hand.
   1175744|00000000||Let them storm. They will not find her there. Syanna is hidden away, in a safe place… She shall await trial there until we have rid ourselves of this accursed vampire.
   1150358|00000000||Which, to judge by your miens, has not yet come to pass.
   1150366|00000000||Did what we could, but--
   1150368|00000000||My patience is at an end, Geralt. Where is he? Where is Dettlaff?
   1150291|00000000||Hm. How… how do your employers customarily react when you fail to meet their expectations?
   1150293|00000000||Depends. Peasants cuss me out. Merchants demand I refund their deposit. Whereas nobles mostly just release their hounds.
   1150295|00000000||And rulers?
   1150297|00000000||Usually threaten me with the gallows.
   1150337|00000000||Her Most Illustrious Grace awaits the gentlemen.
   1150324|00000000||Upset's just not a sensation I feel. Ever. Mutations, remember?
   1150326|00000000||Mh, yes, of course. The excuse you resort to whenever you'd rather not talk about something.
   1150328|00000000||Observant of you. So let's change the subject.
   1150308|00000000||I don't get upset. Mutations, remember?
   1149495|00000000||Do you think Her Grace's nerves have been calmed?
   1165151|00000000||Doubt it. Rarely forgets, rarely retracts what she says… especially not threats.
   1165153|00000000||Yes… Well, even I must admit Dettlaff's actions were highly inappropriate, reprehensible, even.
   1149497|00000000||Are you upset?
   1150285|00000000||Why would I be?
   1150287|00000000||Hmm, let's see… You're returning from your hunt empty-handed. No trophy. No new lead to boast of, then pursue.
   1166266|00000000||The big bad witcher huffed and puffed… and look. Got a bean.
   1167253|00000000||It cannot be!
   1167255|00000000||What cannot be?
   1167257|00000000||You actually have a sense of humor.
   1167298|00000000||We must keep looking.
   1167296|00000000||The beans won't plant themselves, you know.
   1167294|00000000||But, here we are chatting away when there's work to do!
   1167287|00000000||Stunted a bit, but yeah, it's there.
   1167289|00000000||Well, well, aren't you full of surprises. What else are you hiding behind that gruff exterior?
   1167291|00000000||Not a bad singer. Do a pretty mean rendition of "The Maids of Vicovaro," for instance… but some other time, maybe.
   1167259|00000000||Stunted, but there.
   1167258|00000000||Is that so strange?
   1167281|00000000||Hm. Why so shocked?
   1167283|00000000||Well, when you arrived, all you did was pout and mumble things in that gravelly monotone…
   1167285|00000000||And now this. A jest. And a good one at that.
   1204781|00000000||Wine is important - this we all know. Yet in Toussaint wine is sacred. When Geralt found himself embroiled in a dispute between two great winemaking families, represented by Matilda Vermentino and Liam de Coronata, he knew he was treading on shaky ground… Nonetheless, he took a side, resolving to help Liam deal with the problems at his vineyard.<br>
   1204782|00000000||The witcher's efforts paid off handsomely for Liam. The ducal clerk had come to consider Coronata's owner a trustworthy steward, one who would in turn take good care of Belgaard.<br>
   1204785|00000000||The circumstances changed as quickly as a wildfire might dash through a vineyard in a drought. Geralt soon discovered that a third party was behind the problems at Coronata and Vermentino. He shared this news with the vineyards' owners. Prodded by the ducal clerk, they accepted their continuing feud made little sense and agreed to form a consortium.<br>
   1204783|00000000||The witcher's aid had come too late, and Liam de Coronata lost his chance to take control of Belgaard. Nonetheless, he proved an upstanding man, paying the reward he had promised in full.<br>
   1204784|00000000||Luckily, Geralt had faced and handily overcome far greater adversity in the past. So he easily solved the troubles plaguing Coronata. He then headed off to find Liam, expecting gratitude and a sizeable purse.<br>
   1211298|00000000||Yet Liam was not alone in requiring the witcher's aid. When Matilda Vermentino approached him for help, Geralt could not bring himself to turn her down. Surprisingly, once the two vineyards' problems had been resolved, Matilda and Liam decided to form a consortium to conquer al their competitors on the Toussaint wine market.
   1207068|00000000||[Optional] Search Vermentino and find proof of sabotage.
   1204876|00000000||[Optional] Read the note you found at Coronata.
   1204772|00000000||Deal with all the problems at the Coronata Vineyard.
   1202603|00000000||Inform Liam that you've resolved all his problems and help him take control of Belgaard.
   1213422|00000000||Without investigating Vermentino's problems, let Liam take over Belgaard, or continue investigating and deal with Matilda's problems.

   1101069|00000000||Greetings.
   1101071|00000000||Geralt! There you are! So, our painting - are you pleased, is it to your liking? Do tell.
   1105369|00000000||It's… good.
   1105377|00000000||It's… nice. Shows a lot of, uhh, imagination. Don't recall undressing before posing, though. Some of the other details're a bit off, too.
   1105457|00000000||Well, the imagination is an artist's chief tool!
   1105459|00000000||Heard the same from a certain poet. He embellishes and invents - chiefly.
   1103905|00000000||Don't know much about art.
   1103911|00000000||Don't know much about modern art, but… seems nowadays being true to life counts for less than other, umm… qualities.
   1105589|00000000||Do you refer to the fact I painted you au naturel? All the greats do that these days!
   1105591|00000000||My point, exactly. Changed quite a few things, some of the details. Moustacherois embellish this much, too?
   1105593|00000000||To look at his "paintings," one can hardly tell if the subject is depicted en face or in profile, why, even in color or in monochrome. He's an amateur.
   1105595|00000000||Guess I oughta be glad he wasn't the one to paint me, then.
   1147882|00000000||Witcher! Greetings. I've been on pins and needles.  I take it you've come for the painting!
   1122203|00000000||Why not. It'll make an interesting memento. Though I'd hardly call the price a bargain.
   1200274|00000000||Heh. Indeed few have the sophistication to appreciate my technique. I sometimes go hungry as a consequence.
   1122205|00000000||Hm. All right. Least this way I'll be able to control who sees it. Thanks.
   1122200|00000000||Gladly.
   1122201|00000000||No, thanks.
   1122207|00000000||Doubt I'd have any use for it.
   1122209|00000000||I'm sure you'll find an eager… art lover to buy it.
   1147885|00000000||Huh, as special as it is, that's still quite a price. Afraid I don't have that much coin.
   1147887|00000000||Not a problem. Come back when you do. Though I cannot guarantee someone won't have beaten you to it.
   1147883|00000000||Don't have enough coin.
   1122197|00000000||Perhaps you'd care to buy the painting?
   1122199|00000000||Given our rapport, I shall take a loss. For you, I'll part with it, I will - at a special price.
   1103909|00000000||Not exactly what I imagined. I believe I posed with all my clothes on. Clearly remember that, in fact. Some other details are off, too.
   1105375|00000000||Invalid as a criticism! I depicted you in a more flattering state! The painting has drawn crowds, aroused a great deal of interest.
   1105452|00000000||Can see that. Anyway, some advice for the future - warn your subjects about your intentions. Your next model might not be so forgiving.
   1105455|00000000||You don't like it. I'm hurt.
   1103904|00000000||Not quite what I expected.
   1190503|00000000||Before long, you will have to look to fairy tales to find a witcher or knight…
   1190505|00000000||Remember, witcher - history is wrought by those who can hang heroes.
   1190501|00000000||Ehh… This all bodes very ill.
   1190513|00000000||The pleasure is all mine, truly.
   1190515|00000000||Greetings, living legend!
   1190517|00000000||I thank you for saving my life.
   1191703|00000000||Salut, witcher! Once more - I thank you for the rescue!
   1190507|00000000||May the gods' will be done.
   1190511|00000000||Look at that!
   1190509|00000000||For the duchess! For Toussaint!
   1190519|00000000||Madman!
   1191705|00000000||You saved my life… I shall never forget it!
   1204865|cd0eac8b||Philosopher
   1191836|00000000||I thought no one would aid us… It's a pleasure to have you in Toussaint, Geralt!
   1191743|00000000||Splendid work, sir witcher! Safe at last - how good it feels!
   1191747|00000000||You saved us from evil's clutches… Long live witcher Geralt!

   1179034|00000000||Watch out!
   1208576|00000000||One of the people Geralt encountered at the Beauclair court was Captain Damien de la Tour, the captain of the Ducal Guard. He was absolutely and unconditionally (to say “unthinkingly” would be unfair, yet not entirely inaccurate) devoted to his position and worshipped the ground the duchess walked on. If you want my personal opinion, he was most definitely besotted with her.<br>He came across as a typical soldier, i.e., a thickheaded lackey who, seeing Geralt, immediately decided he must prove who had the more massive unmentionables. Geralt treated this challenge with dispassionate superiority, yet accepted it nevertheless and in doing so earned himself another enemy.<br><br>
   1208577|00000000||After he bloodied himself side by side with the witcher, Damien decided the White Wolf was actually an altogether decent fellow who wished only to help. One could even say they shook hands and made up. In their hearts, at least.<br><br>
   1208975|00000000||In the end, what appeared at first to be inconceivable took place. Captain Damien de la Tour stopped looking at the White Wolf like a fox outside a hen house. All it took was for Geralt to save Beauclair from the Beast’s attacks. Once that was done, the two men became friends, in their gruff, manly way.
   1208993|00000000||When Anna Henrietta was treacherously murdered by her own sister, Damien blamed himself most of all and wanted to fall on his sword, as he felt befits a man of honor. The only thing stopping him was the thought that Her Grace would never have forgiven him that. Damien spent many years deep in mourning, often thinking about how the tragic events had come to pass and who was responsible. This meant not only the duchess had died, but all chances for a friendship between him and Geralt of Rivia as well.
   1208976|00000000||After Syanna’s death, Damien fell deep into mourning, for he took to heart anything that caused his duchess pain. He was not only the main executor of her orders, but also her close companion and sympathetic ear. He dealt with these emotions in the gruff way of a soldier and respected the rules of propriety, which kept him from casting blame during the mourning period, even though, according to him, that blame should fall squarely on a certain witcher from Rivia…

   1171735|00000000||Talked to your guards back at the camp. Told me about Clarissa. Sorry to hear about her accident.
   1179923|00000000||Thank you. Kind words that mean a great deal to me.
   1179925|00000000||How's Clarissa these days? Probably can't wait for you to get back.
   1173008|00000000||Haha, to get her gifts, you mean. I've dispatched two already. She'll not need to wait for my return.
   1173010|00000000||En route home, I mean to pass through Dol Blathanna. They say one can see sylvans there.
   1173012|00000000||Yeah, actually happen to know one. Name's Torque. He can be mean, but for the right fee he'll do anything you ask.
   1173014|00000000||Splendid. I thank you for the hint.
   1173016|00000000||Tell him I send my regards.
   1172943|00000000||Your daughter, how's she doing?
   1171782|00000000||Nice meeting you. So long, now.
   1171685|00000000||Farewell.
   1171682|00000000||Exhibition going well?
   1171737|00000000||Good crowd. You got a lot of friends… All of 'em seem to be fawning over your paintings, too.
   1172834|00000000||Oh, when you've as much coin as I do, friends buzz around like flies on fresh meat. And they praise you to high heavens for each trip, burp and sneeze.
   1172836|00000000||Not all are lying sycophants, that's not what I mean… just most, unfortunately.
   1172838|00000000||Why bother? Why even invite them around?
   1172840|00000000||I'm a man of enterprise and must put my trade before any personal hatreds or sympathies. Besides…
   1172842|00000000||Besides…?
   1172844|00000000||At times I'll exhibit a completely failed painting just to listen to them twist their tongues into knots trying to find just the right superlatives to lather on smeared rubbish.
   1172872|00000000||Naturally, the more intent someone is to get into my good graces, the louder they praise my "masterpiece." It's devilish fun, I tell you.
   1168145|00000000||I'm delighted to see you. I've a small gift for you, and I shan't let you refuse.
   1177979|00000000||Thanks.
   1168147|00000000||You are free to sell it, of course… Though I would be honored were you to hang it in your home.
   1171733|00000000||Geralt, a pleasure to see you again. What's brought you back?
   1167707|00000000||Both male and female Beauclair centipedes are formidable predators.
   1167709|00000000||The beasts prefer to hunt in packs, yet the author of this extraordinary work was able to capture a lone specimen, preparing to attack.
   1167781|00000000||Cast your eye on the hunter, who, though fully aware of the danger, wears a look of cold determination on his face as he awaits the optimal moment to strike.
   1167799|00000000||Ahem.
   1177948|00000000||Ah, Geralt, you're here! Wonderful. Come, please.
   1167696|00000000||The wilds of Toussaint harbor innumerable fascinating secrets.
   1167698|00000000||Its picturesque meadows and untouched woodlands are home to one of the most dangerous species of myriopoda this side of the Yaruga.
   1167700|00000000||The Beauclair centipede, as it's commonly called, is seen here proudly displaying its remarkable chitin and calcium carbonate carapace.
   1167668|00000000||Ah, master witcher, welcome. Count Beledal is expecting you.
   1167670|00000000||He awaits in the courtyard, with the other guests.
   1204959|00000000||It's wonderful to meet the subject of the baron's new cycle. Such an opportunity. Enjoy the exhibit.
   1189155|00000000||In Holloway, the witcher came upon two friends of years long past - Palmerin de Launfal and Milton de Peyrac-Peyran, who had come to Velen as emissaries of their sovereign duchess.<br>
   1189156|00000000||It was a time when there seemed to be two Geralts. One was a celebrity, at least in certain circles, while the other remained a mercenary who did dirty work for coin. At any rate, both these Geralts happened on a contract of an unusual sort, not least because it marked the start of a new adventure. And this adventure I will gladly relate.<br>
   1189157|00000000||It began in a manner most ordinary, with a notice posted on a board in Velen. The witcher read the notice and set out to see what else he could learn.<br>
   1189158|00000000||If you find yourself wondering why these knights errant seemed stuck in this slipshod backwater hamlet in Velen, I hasten to explain - they had decided to wage war on some local bandits. Though it was a course worthy of knights of the errant variety, Geralt managed to dissuade them from pursuing it. For experience had taught him nature bears no void, and a band of hoodlums cut down to a man would soon be replaced by another, possibly of a yet meaner disposition. And after all, the knights did not have their sovereign's leave to remain in Velen indefinitely.<br>
   1189159|00000000||If you find yourself wondering why these knights errant seemed stuck in this slipshod backwater hamlet in Velen, I hasten to explain - they had decided to wage war on some local bandits. Palmerin, ever eager to resolve crises peacefully, intended to address the robbers, appeal to their sense of decency and thus direct them onto a path of virtue. Geralt expected Palmerin's rhetoric to fall on deaf ears. When the bandits arrived, Palmerin put in a valiant effort, yet ultimately a bloody fight broke out. The witcher assisted the knights from afar to deal with the local rabble. Though this could seem a somewhat unpatriotic act, there is no doubt Geralt's choice was thoroughly justified and that he had taken the moral high ground.<br>
   1189160|00000000||Yet in telling a story, one should never get ahead of oneself. Suffice now to say the knights delivered their message, and the witcher agreed to take on the contract. He then promptly set off for Toussaint in their company to face the Beast that tormented the duchy. And thus the adventure was underway.<br>
   1210013|00000000||But to return to the crux of our tale, at this time Toussaint lay trembling and near-prostrate, rocked by murders as cruel as they were unusual. The killer had thus far eluded the Ducal Guard, which likewise had no notion of his or her identity. So much was unknown that popular opinion held the murderer to be a cunning monster. Thus, Duchess Anna Henrietta had made it a point to summon to her duchy the cleverest and most accomplished of the witchers she knew. The witcher's task would be to track down and slay the murderer, now commonly referred to as the Beast.<br>For Geralt, the contract stood to be highly lucrative, above all else. Yet it was also an opportunity to revisit the ever charming Toussaint, where the witcher had in the past spent many a beautiful moment in choice company that happened to include yours truly. How deceptive our memories of years long gone can prove! What had promised to be a nostalgic journey into the past would prove a venture rife with events both dramatic and deeply saddening.<br>
   1175250|00000000||Meet the knights from Toussaint in Holloway.
   1175251|00000000||Help Palmerin and Milton defeat the bandits.
   1175252|00000000||Talk to Palmerin and Milton.
   1175253|00000000||Go with Palmerin and Milton to Toussaint.
   1189154|00000000||Look for a new contract on notice boards in Velen.
   1175249|00000000||Envoys, Wineboys
   1188854|00000000||Hey there, little lamb. How much for your wool?
   1194953|00000000||A lot. And treble for you.
   1194955|00000000||Dearie, you ought to take less from me. Haven't you heard? I'm called the "sea serpent."
   1194957|00000000||Because you're slimy and have but two teeth, no doubt.
   1189397|00000000||Everyone who has even a passing acquaintance with Geralt of Rivia knows it was very rare for the witcher to be paid before completing a contract. Retainers or down payments, however, were another story. Those would often be given him by the best of employers, those who had no intention of backing out of their side of the bargain and who wanted the job done and done well above all else. In this regard, Anna Henrietta stood out as one of the best employers Geralt had ever had. Why is that, you ask, Dear Reader? Why, because in exchange for agreeing to kill the Beast of Beauclair, she gave Geralt... the deed to the Corvo Bianco vineyard (and promised further payment in gold as soon as Geralt completed the job). Say what you will about her, but no one can deny Anna Henrietta's generosity.<br>
   1189867|00000000||A preliminary inspection of Geralt's new property uncovered that the vineyard would need quite a bit of fixing up before it could shine in all its glory. This would be a monumental task requiring aesthetic sensibilities Geralt was not sure he possessed. Luckily, he did not have to take it on alone. Aiding him in it would be Barnabas-Basil, his majordomo, who, Geralt soon learned, was an expert not only in the running of households, but also in their remodeling.<br>
   1189868|00000000||I have always liked to fill my days with industrious activity, and without a shadow of a doubt I can say Geralt shared my predilection in this regard. We both prized any chance to toil to make the world a better place, differing only in that I usually used quill and harp to accomplish this, while Geralt did so with his sword. Yet on this occasion, it was Geralt who could bask in the satisfaction that a completed work of aesthetic excellence brings in its wake. When the renovations of Corvo Bianco were complete, Geralt was just as proud of himself as if he had strangled a kikimore with his bare hands.
   1189398|00000000||Go to Corvo Bianco

   1207906|00000000||<i>Never have I seen such a creature! It was like a giant centipede, but white, utterly white!</i><br>– account of Doctor Vittorius de la Vega after the first encounter with the Pale Widow<br><br>This rare variety of giant centipede dwells in underground lairs and owes its name to its unusual, pale white coloring. Like the more common giant centipede, its body is covered in hard, chitinous armor, with numerous hooked limbs sticking out from underneath. Some scholars raise these creatures in laboratory conditions for the properties of their albumen, which makes an excellent base for the brewing of mutagenic potions.

   1100708|00000000||That hair! The scar! The frown! It's all… perfect!
   1102636|00000000||Something you actually want from me? Or are you just gonna go on gushing about my… attributes?

   1102644|00000000||Portrait?
   1102646|00000000||Indeed! Yours! En face, actual size! With the finest vista Toussaint affords behind you!
   1103845|00000000||Pose for me! You must! Naturally, I shall pay the compensation due to you for your modeling services.

   1182966|00000000||Eyewitnesses to gruesome monster attacks always have a hard time describing the creature in question. The beasts move quickly and often attack at night, while the witnesses are terrified and primarily concerned with fleeing for their lives. As a result, witchers quite often have no inkling what creature they face until they find tracks or otherwise establish something for themselves. Such was the case with the Beast tormenting Beauclair. Geralt knew it was deadly, elusive and fiendishly clever. Everything else he heard was clearly the product of imaginations fed by fear of a dangerous predator.<br><br>
   1182967|00000000||When Geralt identified the Beast, he discovered it was a higher vampire, meaning one of the most difficult foes a witcher can come to face.<br><br>Higher vampires are superhumanly strong and fast. They can turn completely invisible, and each comes with its own personalized set of talents and abilities perfected through centuries of existence. <br><br>When Geralt realized he was dealing with such a creature, he swore foully and realized the rumors about the Beast had not been exaggerated in the slightest.

   1193374|00000000||The wtcher drew his great silver sword. Pop! Goes the Beastie! Hahahaha…
   1171772|00000000||Vivat Toussaint!
   1171770|00000000||I don't know about you, but I - I need a drink!
   1181290|00000000||Never again, not a drop, not even of rosé…
   1181288|00000000||Ouch! I'm in pain, pain, pain…!
   1181294|00000000||Don't yell! Please…
   1181292|00000000||Keep it down!
   1185875|00000000||Greetings, brave hero. I am Rafael de Surmann, and I am the ducal camerlengo.
   1200364|00000000||I'm Geralt. So what is it you do here?
   1200366|00000000||I pay the knights errant.
   1200368|00000000||For what?
   1201818|00000000||Our knights wander the roads, protecting Toussaint from bandits and monsters… It is fitting and just that they be recompensed appropriately for these toils.
   1201820|00000000||Err, note, sir, that should you successfully smash a hanse, save a brother knight from peril or extract a captured merchant from the hands of cutthroats, come see me - you shall be rewarded.
   1199619|00000000||Coin to pay the knights, where's it come from?
   1199645|00000000||Can't help but be curious, but where do the funds for those payments come from?
   1199647|00000000||The ducal treasury, of course. Her Illustrious Highness Anna Henrietta assigns great value to bravery and selfless patriotism.
   1200390|00000000||It is her standing order that any knight may receive a wage…
   1201822|00000000||Akh akh. Pardon me - financial compensation for his dedication to defending the duchy's internal security and order.
   1188483|00000000||Wouldn't happen to play gwent, would you?
   1189140|00000000||Care for a game of gwent?
   1184179|00000000||Well, see you later.
   1199641|00000000||Go in peace, fair knight.
   1185877|00000000||Farewell.
   1185876|00000000||You sell things too. Show me what you've got?
   1185560|00000000||Wouldn't mind a glance at your books. Ones you're willing to sell, that is.
   1185558|00000000||My most heartfelt gratitude, sir. Compensation for your sacrifice…
   1185556|00000000||I've heard reports of feats of great bravery. Thus, please accept this reward for your dedication, sir.
   1199643|00000000||My clerks have brought word of heroic deeds on your part. Please accept this compensation for your toil, good sir.
   1199649|00000000||Much is said in Beauclair of your bravery and dedication. Thus, you've secured a claim to compensation. Sign here, please.
   1201824|00000000||Speaking of payment…
   1185873|00000000||Greetings, knight.

   1183733|00000000||Geralt, you must hightail it out of here. The duchess is deadly serious.
   1183727|00000000||Oh-ho! Someone got up on the wrong side of the bed!
   1183729|00000000||Ooh la la! No jesting with this one.
   1183741|00000000||Well, heidily-ho!
   1183735|00000000||Heh, heh - greetings!
   1183737|00000000||That's just plain rude!
   1196126|00000000||The hairdresser, Jean Louis - a knight kidnapped him and threatened to disembowel him. All because Louis gave him a crooked cut.
   1196128|00000000||They say Durand Faucher-Plamondon de Savarin went mad and summoned some demon that devoured all the friends of history!
   1196124|00000000||One of the horses collapsed beneath a knight at the starting line during the tourney. Apparently he had fed it fisstech to make it swifter!
   1183739|00000000||Witcher! Calm down!
   1157301|00000000||Geralt! Well, I'll be! Have you decided to turn knight errant?
   1134313|00000000||All jesting aside, here on a job. You in the tourney, too?
   1134315|00000000||Am I? Hah! I shall square off against Rainfarn of Attre. I saw him just moments ago - a nervous wreck. Stuffing his nose with fisstech, no less - as if that will aid his determination!
   1134614|00000000||Guessing that's against the rules.
   1134616|00000000||But who's to tell a Nilfgaardian what to do…? Listen, Geralt, I've a tip for you.
   1134612|00000000||The timing of your marksmanship duel is such that you shall have the sun in your eyes.
   1134618|00000000||Makes no difference to me either way.
   1134620|00000000||Nor will it give you any pleasure. Since as it is we must both wait, play me in a round of gwent. Should you win, I shall swap with you. To me, a southerner, the sun is no hindrance.
   1124965|00000000||Never turn down a round of gwent.
   1124912|00000000||Let's play.
   1124913|00000000||Not now.
   1125375|00000000||Sir Ravix of Fourhorn! Give us a bow!
   1205941|00000000||The targets he must with his quarrels thread are red.
   1208426|00000000||May the better man win!
   1125373|00000000||Sir Geralt of Rivia! Give us a bow!
   1207805|00000000||Fair knights, I salute you. The honor and duty of tourney patron have fallen to me this year. Fight honorably, so that I may bestow upon one of your number the tourney's grand prize.
   1207807|00000000||You have sworn your vows, you have readied body and soul. The time has come to test them!
   1130030|00000000||Behold Horm Akerspaark of the Maechtian royal line! His name’s quite the mouthful, a true challenge to rhyme! His targets to be hit centrally and true are the ones in blue.
   1130033|00000000||Against him, new blood, a knight unknown till now…
   1125350|00000000||I congratulate you! We shall swap as agreed. We've passed the time rather nicely. Lady Vivienne should appear forthwith. I'm off, to face my first challenge!
   1208513|00000000||Good luck.
   1124920|00000000||Ehh, I almost regret beating you. But we've passed the time nicely. Lady Vivienne should appear forthwith. You shall shoot first.
   1124909|00000000||Thanks. Another time, maybe.
   1124911|00000000||Hah! You've denied me some diversion, but at the least my eyes are in for a treat. Lady Vivienne should appear shortly.
   1170785|00000000||Brave Sir Ravix has hit over one half of his marks! Will he manage to prevail? Are these glory's first sparks?
   1170821|00000000||Heroic Horm has accurately landed over half his shots! What sharp eyes, strong hands, well-turned calves he's got!
   1170819|00000000||Geralt jumps ahead, leaves the others behind?! Do I see this falsely? Am I out of my mind?
   1170817|00000000||Ravix jumps ahead, leaves the others behind! Do I see this falsely? Am I out of my mind?
   1170783|00000000||Like a lover gauchely grasping but one fair teet, Geralt’s half-strewn 'twixt joyous victory and bitter defeat!
   1174969|00000000||You lick it, you buy it!
   1174967|00000000||What is it you need?
   1174971|00000000||Scour all the fairs, you'll find no better wares!
   1174973|00000000||Get them while they're hot!
   1209010|00000000||If this world has ever known a ruler who enjoyed the absolute admiration of her subjects without the need for systematic repression or a particularly cruel hangman, it was, without a doubt, the sovereign of Toussaint, Duchess Anna Henrietta. Called Anarietta by those who knew her well, she was the widow of the late lamented Duke Raymund and one-time lover of a very famous and talented artist who would prefer to remain anonymous.<br><br>A few years prior, when the witcher and a band of friends were visiting Toussaint, Anna Henrietta had had the pleasure of meeting Geralt of Rivia. When a mysterious Beast began attacking her courtiers, the duchess thus knew exactly whom to summon…<br>
   1208584|00000000||While searching for the Beast, the duchess proved that, when the need arose, she was able to throw off the chains of convention and get her hands dirty with direct action alongside the witcher. Even if she had to do so in a state of relative dishabille.<br>
   1208585|00000000||Surprisingly enough, the duchess handled the rigors of the trail as adroitly as she did those of palace audiences. Geralt quickly saw how, even when stripped of her sumptuous gown and wrapped in a coarse cloak, Anna Henrietta remained the same confident and tenacious ruler as ever. Yet then again, this should not have come as a surprise, for the Toussaint court on a daily basis hosted battles of cutting remarks, malicious half-truths and bald-faced lies that were just as fierce as any fought with sword and cannon. The duchess was an unchallenged master of this courtly warfare, and the witcher had the chance to make use of this experience.<br>
   1208586|00000000||If Geralt thought the tales of Her Illustrious Grace’s implacable wrath were exaggerated, he quickly was shown how greatly he was mistaken. As soon as Anna Henrietta learned the vampire had not only escaped, but had also threatened the life of her sister, she flew into a rage that precluded all discussion. She presented matters very clearly: Geralt was to complete his contract and bring her Dettlaff’s head on a silver platter.<br>
   1208587|00000000||Luckily, the duchess’ wrath burned with an intense but short-lasting heat. When Geralt managed to stop Dettlaff, Her Grace forgot all about his previous missteps and even awarded the witcher the Order of Vitis Vinifera, Toussaint’s highest honor.
   1209011|00000000||The same compassion and loyalty which earned her the love of her subjects proved Anna Henrietta’s doom, leading to her murder at the hands of her own sister. Ever since that tragic day, Toussaint has celebrated an annual Week of Memory. For these seven days, the duchy enters into mourning: music stops, lights are shuttered and people hang dark curtains in their homes. They say all those who were fond of the duchess do likewise, even those who live far away, in the North…
   1208588|00000000||It was not hard to predict how Geralt’s time in Anna Henrietta’s company would end. Eventually, the witcher fall into Her Grace’s disfavor with a typical witcherly lack of grace. Who could have foreseen handing the duchess’ sister over to a vampire would end badly for him? Not Geralt, it seems. Knowing Her Grace’s fiery character, he was quite lucky he didn’t leave the duchy a head shorter.

   1164131|00000000||Well, damn thing's full o' noise, the arse-clenchin' sort, clinkety-bangity-knockity kind. Sent my clerk in to see. Been two days, and he's not back.
   1164148|00000000||I reckon it's ought to do with the elven ruins - blech! - that abut the cave. So? Lend us a hand, will you?
   1163111|00000000||Some evil's afoot in that cave. It's made its lair there! It's swallowed Fillon whole!
   1163109|00000000||Fine. I'll have a look in the cave, see what lurks there.
   1163092|00000000||All right. I'll look into it.
   1163103|00000000||All clear now? Did you manage it?
   1163099|00000000||Yeah. All taken care of.
   1163101|00000000||Hah! And folk call witchers layabouts and freeloaders. Bollocks!
   1163105|00000000||Not yet. But stay away from there for now. Air inside's unhealthy.
   1163107|00000000||Argh… Fate's a bitch gone in the teeth. Where am I to find another cave as snug as that?
   1163113|00000000||Sorry, can't say I'm interested. So long.
   1163093|00000000||Not interested. So long.
   1210230|00000000||Let's talk about my reward.
   1210234|00000000||Could help. Provided you can pay.
   1210236|00000000||Whoa, mate! Can't possibly pay you that much!
   1210238|00000000||Hm, yes, we's almost there…
   1210242|00000000||I'd be wantin' to bring this to a close about now. Will you do it or no?
   1210240|00000000||Agreed.
   1163097|00000000||Been to the cave. Full of monsters, all right - gargoyles. Safe now, though, I guarantee it.
   1164150|00000000||Bugger me! That is what I call good, efficient service!
   1201842|00000000||Storehouse will be ready in two days at the most… And here on in, you've cut-rate prices on all my goods!
   1155692|00000000||Ah, good to see you again. What can I do for you?
   1196343|00000000||Is it over, is it done?
   1156660|00000000||I thank you once more for coming to my rescue-- Ah, but where are my manners?! Ahem. Master witcher, allow me to introduce myself…
   1205799|00000000||I am Jean-Louis Ludovic, a magna cum laude graduate of the Les Monts-Poilus Cosmetology Institute. Please consider my scissors and razor at your disposal.
   1156664|00000000||Do something about this beard, would you?
   1155524|00000000||Thanks. So long.
   1206191|00000000||I shall cling to my scissors and comb as long as I've strength left in my fingers!
   1156665|00000000||Should be going.
   1156663|00000000||I'd like a new 'do.
   1211183|00000000||Queen's pageboy.
   1156662|00000000||Greetings once more, master witcher. Here for a trim? Defoliation?
   1162646|00000000||What you see is what you get.
   1162644|00000000||What's the problem?
   1162648|00000000||To cripple someone - is that what you want?
   1162652|00000000||You will rot in a dungeon!
   1162654|00000000||Here we come a-walloping!
   1162650|00000000||Oh, huff, puff, gamuff…
   1162658|00000000||Sight any sign of the Beast, report it to the Ducal Guard post haste!
   1162656|00000000||Raise no fuss! Water no wine!
   1162660|00000000||So you know the duchess - do you believe that means you can do what you please?!
   1196331|00000000||*Whistles*
   1196333|00000000||Life's shit sometimes.
   1196335|00000000||Oy!
   1196337|00000000||Mummy!
   1075638|8552a100||Bodyguard
   1202220|00000000||Hail. Heard heaps about ye.
   1202222|00000000||Never thought I'd meet ye here, witcher of Rivia.
   1195244|00000000||[Spare the shaelmaar.]
   1194340|00000000||Monster's no threat! No need to kill it!
   1194342|00000000||A victor may always show mercy! It is his right! Long live Geralt the Merciful!
   1194344|00000000||Pikemen, see to the beast!
   1166987|00000000||A fight against a shaelmaar, arranging something like that for sport - bad idea.
   1166989|00000000||Your Grace, shaelmaars're dangerous creatures, even to knights in full plate armor.
   1166991|00000000||Nonsense. In Toussaint, knights have battled beasts for mere glory since time immemorial. True, Guillaume suffered a few bumps, scars and bruises, but in return gained eternal glory as he who slew the monster.
   1166993|00000000||Mhm. What about the crowd? Say the shaelmaar had vaulted into the stands. Would've been a massacre.
   1166995|00000000||Geralt, though we value your fortuitous intervention in the arena, we would remind you your services have been retained, and, as shall soon become clear, you will be generously compensated - for completing another task altogether.
   1166986|00000000||About the contract…
   1167029|00000000||Not always.
   1167039|00000000||Not quite, Your Grace. Law of Surprise… it's something we invoke at times, but rarely. Usually we just take gold.
   1167041|00000000||Disappointing. This "law" sounds rather romantic. On the other hand, on returning to the palace we would likely find impatient petitioners or a set of sample fabrics for a new dress. Poor rewards, both.
   1168046|00000000||I fear you'd not have much use for any of the surprises we are likely to come upon.
   1167028|00000000||No.
   1167035|00000000||No, Your Grace. Usually we just ask for gold.
   1167037|00000000||The response we expected.
   1209226|00000000||Your Grace!
   1209228|00000000||Ah!
   1209230|00000000||What the hell?! Why, I shall--
   1209232|00000000||Your Highness! I…
   1209234|00000000||Mind it doesn't get wrinkled.
   1209236|00000000||Onward!
   1209242|00000000||Hey!
   1209244|00000000||That is silk! Be careful!
   1209246|00000000||Give it to me!
   1209250|00000000||Agh…
   1167092|00000000||Your Grace, we need to find Milton. Immediately.
   1167094|00000000||Rather problematic. You see, the garden entertainments are due to start, and he's disguised as the Hare, hiding somewhere, waiting for some tipsy courtiers to find him. The Hare's hiding place is a carefully-guarded secret.
   1167096|00000000||We must call off the game, at once!
   1167100|00000000||First and foremost, we must remain calm.
   1167102|00000000||Damien, order the gardens searched, immediately but discreetly. By no means can we disrupt the festivities. Panic will only incite the Beast to strike sooner.
   1167104|00000000||And you, witcher, follow me! My gardens, my knight, I shall take the fore.
   1167106|00000000||A murder is out of the question. I will not allow it! Not near my palace!
   1167108|00000000||Horses! Ready our horses!
   1167089|00000000||Need to find Milton.
   1167090|00000000||What's that mean - a team?
   1167112|00000000||They were a team?
   1167114|00000000||They were close friends, tightly knit. And as such earned the trust of our father, the duke. We often witnessed him turn to them with delicate matters. Later, their paths diverged.
   1189306|00000000||Unlikely to be a coincidence. Beast must know it, too. It's a lead, I'm sure.
   1169708|00000000||Beast seems to be pointing up moral decay, denouncing it. Victims were all humiliated. Might've been murdered to emphasize their lack of specific chivalric virtues.
   1201631|00000000||Honor compromised by the pillory, wisdom by ridicule, generosity by a coin pouch shoved down a throat… It seems to fit, true, though not perfectly.
   1167068|00000000||Can't discount the theory if it's on the lips of everyone in town. Say our reasoning's right - next murder'll be just as showy and denounce the victim's lack of the fourth virtue - valor. We can also assume that victim'll be an elder knight.
   1167070|00000000||Let's think… At the moment, all the knights are either at the tourney grounds or in the palace gardens. Our annual Hare Hunt shall begin there shortly. Have you heard of the custom?
   1201633|00000000||Milton mentioned something. Seemed excited to prance around in a bunny costume, not sure why.
   1201635|00000000||Hang on… Strange circumstances, a knight advanced in years, the famed cowardice of rabbits…
   1167072|00000000||Could it be that simple? Is Milton de Peyrac-Peyran the next victim?
   1201669|00000000||Milton also knew de la Croix. Told me so, down by the river.
   1189308|00000000||Damien! To miss something so obvious! De Peyrac-Peyran, Crespi, de la Croix and du Lac formed a knightly team! It was years ago, but…
   1173096|00000000||Beast's denouncing moral decay.
   1173211|00000000||Why those virtues, exactly?
   1173213|00000000||Five virtues - why're they so important to your knights?
   1173215|00000000||Strange question.
   1173217|00000000||Your Grace, forgive me. I'm a foreigner trying to understand another land's customs.
   1173219|00000000||You are forgiven. According to legend the virtues we cultivate were bestowed upon us by the Lady of the Lake. How we truly came to espouse them, none remember.
   1173221|00000000||In Toussaint we believe men of low birth should be simple-hearted and obedient. We expect much more, however, of our knights. They are to be soldiers and courtiers, lords and servants. Thus the need for clear moral guidelines.
   1173223|00000000||At the time of his dubbing, a knight vows to demonstrate, throughout his life, honor, wisdom, generosity, valor and compassion.
   1168061|00000000||Lots of similarities between the victims. All the bodies were found in strange places, under extraordinary circumstances. Seems the murderer, whoever or whatever it is, has some meaning to convey.
   1168063|00000000||These were honorable men. We are horrified by the disdain, the disrespect with which they were treated. These were knights of Toussaint, blast it!
   1167064|00000000||Might be the point. From what you say, none was a model of virtue. Ever considered that's what the Beast's trying to draw attention to?
   1167066|00000000||All the murdered men were knights who swore fealty to the five chivalric virtues. And even if th--
   1169704|00000000||Knights of Toussaint swear fealty to what virtues, exactly?
   1169706|00000000||Honor, wisdom, generosity, valor, and compassion.
   1167046|00000000||Similarities between the victims - seem to be more and more of them.
   1168523|00000000||So, first two victims were knights, best years behind them.
   1168525|00000000||The same could be said of the third. Sir de la Croix was wont to claim that in modern times knights face new challenges, enterprise being the latest addition to the chivalric virtues.
   1168580|00000000||He made a veritable fortune in the grain trade. Palmerin even nicknamed him Sir de la Stingy.
   1168582|00000000||Found a coin pouch on his body. Contained florens, dating from various times, hailing from different provinces of the empire.
   1168584|00000000||De la Croix loved coin, true, but had no patience for numismatics.
   1167047|00000000||The victims - both older knights.
   1168647|00000000||Second murder - tell me what you know.
   1168649|00000000||In the city there are certain nooks, no one reasonable ventures there after dark. Ramon du Lac's corpse was found in one such place.
   1169065|00000000||With the first murder, terror gripped the city. Its inhabitants grew wary, kept to safe areas. Consequently, news of the second victim came to us from a group of concerned… cutpurses.
   1168651|00000000||Criminals fear the Beast? Telling, in a way. Take it you've excluded the possibility that Ramon died at the hands of these bandits.
   1168653|00000000||Do you believe me an amateur? Not hands, but claws killed Ramon du Lac. The wound was deep, clean.
   1168655|00000000||His body was found in the gutter, dressed in nightshirt and cap, a pillow placed under his head and his sword replaced by a bed warmer. Ramon du Lac! A knight who but a dozen years past was an advisor to our father, the duke.
   1168657|00000000||Someone went to a lot of trouble to make him look ridiculous. Maybe revenge was the motive?
   1168659|00000000||It's not out of the question. Du Lac had shady dealings with the criminal underworld, but no one ever came forth with concrete proof of any misdoings.
   1168544|00000000||Beast's second victim - tell me about him.
   1168521|00000000||Beast's first victim - what do we know?
   1168527|00000000||How'd it start? Who was the first victim?
   1168529|00000000||Crespi was the first to die. He was famed once for his many glorious tournament victories. Then he grew old, hung up his sword and took to wine making.
   1168531|00000000||Crespi was not loved by the wine merchants - he was ruthless in business and thought to cheat many a time. He asked us for a dispensation from all court ceremonies. We did not grant it, we could not. Once you've taken the oath of a knight, you remain a knight till death.
   1168533|00000000||How'd he die? Where'd they find the body?
   1168535|00000000||Quite unusual, the circumstance. He was at a feast when suddenly one of his fellow feast goers noticed he was missing. The Town Watch found him an hour later - on his hands and knees, propped against the town pillory, his sword hanging from his neck.
   1168537|00000000||He had died of wounds inflicted with claws, not a weapon. Blows of great force.
   1168539|00000000||So he died suddenly - but the body was on its knees. Meaning someone posed it.
   1168543|00000000||So it seems.
   1167043|00000000||Thus we've decided you shall receive the deed to a vineyard, Corvo Bianco, and a sum of coin. You will doubtless consider this adequate.
   1167045|00000000||Title to the vineyard shall be given to you at once - surely you'll need lodgings while you hunt. The coin, however, will be yours only once you have slain the Beast.
   1167049|00000000||Lovely, generous gesture, Your Grace. But, uh, Corvo Bianco - isn't it the duchy's temporary morgue?
   1167051|00000000||Is it, now? The chancellery's bungled things again, we fear! Not to be left unsupervised for one instant!
   1167053|00000000||Yet in its mood a morgue should present minimal problems to a witcher. What’s more, nothing enhances a wine's reputation better than a grim legend.
   1167057|00000000||Thank you, Your Grace. I accept the contract, of course. But as I said before, I'll need some information.
   1167031|00000000||Yes, Your Grace. The Law of Surprise. Time-honored.
   1167033|00000000||Hm, we shall be candid. The surprises we encounter on a daily basis would be of no value to one such as you.
   1168026|00000000||What awaits at the palace are edicts to sign and portraits of suitors from far-off lands. I fear you would find little use for either.
   1167027|00000000||Yes.
   1163028|00000000||I examined the body of the Beast's last victim. Might've found something, need to analyze it. A quiet place - that's what I could use most right now. And maybe the help of an alchemist or a mage.
   1167009|00000000||Also like to hear all you know about the previous victims. Take it Sir de la Tour's my man for that?
   1163030|00000000||Firstly, call me Damien, please. Secondly, you should know I spoke against summoning you here.
   1168024|00000000||I've heard much about you. You bring trouble, or thus far have, always. And we've enough trouble as it is. Yet we are capable of defeating the Beast on our own, without an outsider's help. I've no doubt about it.
   1167011|00000000||Damien, we settled the matter of the witcher's employ some time past. Definitively. Since you have broached it nonetheless, let us discuss Geralt's pay.
   1167013|00000000||Are the legends true? Do witchers usually demand "that which you find at home, yet did not expect"?
   1163867|00000000||Gonna need two things - information and access to a laboratory.
   1163868|00000000||Sorry to have to tell you - a bruxa killed some guardsmen.
   1168441|00000000||Sorry to have to tell you, but the guardsmen handling the last victim's body--
   1168443|00000000||I know already. The creature in the cellar of Corvo Bianco - was it the Beast?
   1168445|00000000||No, a bruxa, a kind of vampire. Not the Beast, but tied to it in some way.
   1168447|00000000||You know this how?
   1168449|00000000||Through careful analysis of the evidence, both on the riverbank and at Corvo Bianco.
   1168451|00000000||Do you mean to insinuate the investigation thus far has been sloppy?
   1168453|00000000||Geralt insinuates nothing of the sort. We must listen to him attentively.
   1168017|00000000||Tell us, have you come alone, or did Viscount Julian accompany you?
   1163855|00000000||Wish to see Dandelion, Your Grace?
   1163857|00000000||Yes! I mean, no! Ugh. Yes. But solely to tell him we regret - yes, deeply regret - rescinding the death sentence we so justly handed down upon him.
   1163860|00000000||If we could turn back time, we would make certain he sat in a tower till he rotted - no, we would ensure he was broken on the wheel, then drawn, hanged and quartered!
   1167001|00000000||Ah! The very man we would entrust with these tasks - Damien de la Tour, captain of my personal guard.
   1167003|00000000||Your Grace. Witcher.
   1167005|00000000||Greetings.
   1166997|00000000||Your Grace, my contract - I'd like to discuss it.
   1166999|00000000||Naturally. But not here.
   1168015|00000000||We shall need Damien. He led the investigation pending your arrival. But wherever could he be? Come, we must find him.
   1163826|00000000||Geralt! Magnificent! Breathtaking!
   1163828|00000000||Your Grace…
   1163830|00000000||We knew that to summon you was a brilliant idea! We are delighted, ravished, to have struck upon it.
   1163832|00000000||And I'm truly… uhh, honored…
   1185994|00000000||See to our young hero - hop hop! For we must make off with Geralt. We should talk.
   1163834|00000000||We had been long awaiting your arrival, had nearly lost hope. Then suddenly - that entrance! So spectacular!
   1185052|00000000||Guillaume?
   1185054|00000000||The lad came damned close to dying.
   1185056|00000000||I'm… fine… not hurt at all… Vivienne…?
   1185058|00000000||Smile as befits a hero and keep silent. Speech clearly pains you. She approaches.
   1185060|00000000||Geralt… We must… talk… Vivienne…
   1200573|00000000||You shall talk later. In the medics' tent.
   1194346|00000000||Forgive me. I am not as nimble as in my younger years.
   1194348|00000000||You fought bravely. Thanks for your help.
   1194336|00000000||It's suffered enough.
   1194338|00000000||The monster lies slain! The fight is done! Praised be the victors!
   1195243|00000000||[Kill the shaelmaar.]
   1194328|00000000||The shaelmaar lies defeated by Geralt of Rivia, master of the witchering trade! Behold as the last gasps of life seep from the beast!
   1194330|00000000||Master Geralt, do what you must! Finish the deed!
   1205480|00000000||Splendid, but do we know who was behind the vineyards' woes? Have you any proof?
   1205482|00000000||Not much, just some hints.
   1203420|00000000||Both vineyards should be fine now.
   1203456|00000000||Solved your problems. Coronata and Vermentino can both go back to operating normally.
   1203422|00000000||I know the saboteur's identity.
   1203563|00000000||One and the same man caused Coronata's and Vermentino's problems. Got proof. A certain Count Crespi - he's at the root of it all.
   1205652|00000000||What? Crespi?! Belgaard's erstwhile owner?! Why, that's impossible!
   1206070|00000000||Got it all here, in writing.
   1205654|00000000||He did, indeed, have motive… He knew well his own vineyard could not survive if Vermentino and Coronata were to join forces.
   1205656|00000000||Probably why he incited the feud. Pulled it off, too, mostly. Just failed to bring his plan to completion when the Beast got him.
   1205672|00000000||Incredible… You mean to say it… it wasn't Liam?
   1205674|00000000||And I was certain my troubles were Matilda's doing…!
   1203565|00000000||Ahem, in light of new evidence, the most just resolution would be for both injured parties to share oversight of Belgaard.
   1203567|00000000||Wait just a minute. Do you mean to suggest we're to… cooperate?
   1203569|00000000||It's the optimal solution, yes. In terms of the health of the enterprise, as well.
   1205676|00000000||Hmm. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I do believe he's right. Perhaps it is time to bury the hatchet.
   1205678|00000000||Three vineyards are more than one… There's much to be gained. So be it.
   1203423|00000000||Farewell.
   1204128|00000000||Take care, now.
   1203574|00000000||I'm glad we've come to an agreement. One question remains - what's to become of Coronata and Vermentino?
   1203576|00000000||Got caught up in the investigation. Still got problems there. But I'll clear them up.
   1205684|00000000||Excellent. Then we shall await news in that matter. Preferably good news.
   1205687|00000000||That's not all. The troubles at your vineyards - solved them. You can go back to operating normally, now.
   1205689|00000000||Splendid news. I'm relieved to see you hired a professional, especially one who's aid might still prove invaluable. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Follow me. It is high time you saw Belgaard.
   1205691|00000000||Witcher, come with us, please. Something tells me we'll have tasks for you yet…
   1203477|00000000||Ahem, under the circumstances, hints will have to do. And I fear they cast a decidedly unfavorable light upon Master Liam, who seems to have sought deliberately to bring harm to the Vermentino vineyard.
   1205487|00000000||And in turn disqualifies him as a potential buyer. Thus, by the power vested in me as executor of this office, I do hereby sell the Belgaard vineyard to Maid Matilda.
   1203479|00000000||Yes! Wonderful!
   1203481|00000000||I cannot believe this! It defies reason! I'm innocent! Do you hear?!
   1205489|00000000||You were in cahoots with her from the start, weren't you? You can forget your reward, you vile witchery… witchery… Ah, blast you!
   1203483|00000000||How sad to see a sore loser… You must come to my new vineyard, witcher. You'll see what I've gained thanks to you. Your reward I'll pay there.
   1205395|00000000||What's this? Both vineyards? Why… that puts me in quite a bind.
   1205397|00000000||Then let me release you - sell Belgaard to me.
   1205399|00000000||Oh, out of the question!
   1205401|00000000||Quiet! Do not dare to start that again, or I'll not sell to either of you!
   1205403|00000000||In light of the situation, I would advise the parties to form a partnership.
   1205405|00000000||What?!
   1205407|00000000||You heard me - a partnership. That is my final decision. Now please come with me - I shall show you your new property.
   1205409|00000000||Hang on. What about my pay?
   1211283|00000000||A word once given… The job is done, the pay is due. Take it.
   1205474|00000000||Just a minute. You got us into this bind, so now you must come and see it through. I've a strong sense we'll soon have more work for you. Me and my dog-diddled new partner.
   1205439|00000000||All right. Let's go.
   1205436|00000000||Fine. I'll go to Belgaard.
   1205437|00000000||Join you later.
   1205441|00000000||Join you later. Need to tend to something else, first.
   1203419|00000000||Coronata vineyard's back to normal.
   1203438|00000000||Solved the problems at Coronata. Vineyard can go back to operating normally.
   1203440|00000000||Hah! I can't remember the last time something tickled me so! Thank you, witcher! Your pay.
   1203442|00000000||Wait. What about Vermentino? You helped him, but not me?
   1203444|00000000||Ahem, if I might interject… Under the circumstances, oversight of Belgaard shall pass to Master Liam. Provided he still wishes to assume it, of course…
   1205180|00000000||Pish-posh! I've already drawn up a harvest schedule!
   1205182|00000000||Ahem, you… you may be forced to adjust it, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Time to visit Belgaard. Please follow me.
   1205185|00000000||He's up to something and I don't like it. Come with me, witcher. There could be another contract for you in this…
   1205188|00000000||Witcher, wait. You must help me, please. Else my vineyard will fall into ruin.
   1205190|00000000||See what I can do.
   1203470|00000000||Are you coming, witcher? We ought at least to see what he wants to show us.
   1203487|00000000||Under the circumstances, it is my pleasure to announce that title to the Belgaard Vineyard will officially be signed over to the new consortium the two of you shall form.
   1205694|00000000||Truly? I cannot believe it! We've done it!
   1205696|00000000||Thank you, witcher! I've no idea how to repay you!
   1205698|00000000||Could start with my reward…
   1211281|00000000||Yeees, well deserved, I daresay. Here.
   1203489|00000000||Ahem, far be it from me to insist, but I've a feeling a professional's aid might yet be useful to you. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Come with me, it is high time you saw Belgaard.
   1203493|00000000||I'm not sure I liked his tone… Come with us, witcher. Something tells me we shall have work for you yet…
   1203462|00000000||Ahem, under the circumstances, hints will have to do. And I fear they cast a decidedly unfavorable light upon Maid Matilda, who seems to have sought deliberately to bring harm to the Coronata vineyard.
   1203464|00000000||And in turn disqualifies her as a potential buyer. Thus, by the power vested in me as executor of this office, I do hereby sell the Belgaard vineyard to Master Liam.
   1203473|00000000||Hah! We've won, witcher! Thank you!
   1203475|00000000||What's this? Is that it? Without proof, without a trial?
   1205504|00000000||Apologies, but we've no time for that. The ducal minister strongly desires the matter be resolved quickly. Especially as there's a great deal to do yet in Belgaard… as you shall soon see. Come.
   1205643|00000000||Devils damn you all!
   1205646|00000000||I'm not sure I like that tome-jockey's tone… Come with me, witcher, you must. I shall pay you once we're there. Though something tells me you'll get another contract out of this before we're through…
   1203466|00000000||Witcher, are you coming? We should see what's afoot at Belgaard.
   1203425|00000000||Vermentino can go back to operating normally.
   1203427|00000000||Truly?! Wonderful! I'm but a step from taking over Belgaard! I really don't know how to thank you. Your reward.
   1203431|00000000||Wait. What about me? What about Coronata?
   1205153|00000000||Ahem, if I might interject… Under the circumstances, oversight of Belgaard shall pass to Maid Matilda. Provided she still wishes to assume it, of course…
   1205155|00000000||Of course I do! Why wouldn't I?
   1205157|00000000||I shall explain everything shortly. Come with me - it's time we toured Belgaard.
   1205161|00000000||Come with us, witcher. I rather dislike this bureaucrat's tone. I might have work for you yet…
   1205163|00000000||Wait. I beg you, help me. If you don't I shall go out of business for good. You must look to Coronata, you must.
   1205174|00000000||Fine. I'll see what I can do.
   1203418|00000000||Vermentino vineyard's problems - gone.
   1206139|00000000||A lot of sabotage going on - at both vineyards.
   1204627|00000000||This vineyard, Belgaard - why's it so valuable?
   1204629|00000000||Ehh, you are not from here, it certainly shows… Before Count Crespi fell prey to the Beast, Belgaard belonged to him.
   1205208|00000000||As a man of wealth and influence, he guided it to immense success, brought in rare grape varieties, hired skilled workers…
   1205210|00000000||I shan't trouble you with unnecessary details. Suffice to say that merging Belgaard with another vineyard is a sure recipe for success.
   1204625|00000000||Belgaard - anything special about it?
   1203421|00000000||Sabotage going on at the vineyards.
   1205223|00000000||No.
   1205225|00000000||Then you must find some. These are weighty accusations, they will not stand on hearsay.
   1205227|00000000||Right. I'll come by once I've got something solid.
   1203552|00000000||Found evidence of sabotage on Coronata lands. Someone's been causing trouble, with an aim in mind.
   1203554|00000000||Mhm. I daresay I even know who.
   1203556|00000000||What are you staring at?! I had nothing to do with this!
   1203558|00000000||Wait, wait! A third party is responsible for Coronata's problems? Have you any proof?
   1203544|00000000||You were right - Vermentino's problems didn't come out of nowhere. Someone was behind them.
   1203546|00000000||What do you mean, "someone"?! Liam did this!
   1203548|00000000||Oooh, no, no, no! I will not listen to this slander!
   1203550|00000000||Wait, wait! A third party is responsible for Vermentino's problems? Have you any proof?
   1203533|00000000||Coronata's and Vermentino's troubles didn't come out of nowhere. Found evidence someone was behind them.
   1203538|00000000||Specifically, someone planted archespore bulbs around the properties. That's in these letters. As for who it was…
   1203540|00000000||What do you mean, who?! Him! And only him!
   1203542|00000000||You're mad, woman! Surely you hatched this plot and now seek to stick me with the blame!
   1205217|00000000||Calm down! Both of you!
   1205219|00000000||I'll find the place the letters mention. We'll clear this up.
   1203417|00000000||Master witcher! Have you any news?
   1204155|00000000||Greetings, witcher. Any news about Coronata?
   1205417|00000000||Yeah, you can go back to operating normally. Tended to all your troubles there.
   1205419|00000000||I thank you. At least now I've some small chance of evading bankruptcy. Though, now that Matilda's bought Belgaard, I shall be far from the biggest player on the market…
   1205467|00000000||Ah well, one ought not cry over spilt wine. I must get to work. Thank you, witcher - the pay we agreed.
   1204135|00000000||Ah, witcher. Greetings.
   1205413|00000000||Solved the troubles at your vineyard.
   1205415|00000000||A shame it's too late… Liam's bought Belgaard. I'm left to be but a minor supplier. Such is life sometimes.
   1205463|00000000||Still, thank you. The amount we agreed, here.
   1185757|00000000||The witcher will speak with the inmate. You can take a momentary break.
   1185759|00000000||As long as it's truly but a moment. Highly irregular, this.
   1186535|00000000||Like to understand what's going on.
   1186537|00000000||Just like to know what's going on around me. Can't stand confusion, unexplained situations.
   1186562|00000000||Have you come to ask me what drives me? What my motives are?
   1180138|00000000||Lemme hear it.
   1180170|00000000||Actually came hoping to learn something. It's clear you were out for vengeance. Against those who drove you from the palace? Curse of the Black Sun, that was their reason, right?
   1180174|00000000||It's certainly what they claimed… They said I was dangerous. A mutant.
   1180182|00000000||Knights… Crespi, du Lac, de la Croix and Peyrac-Peyran - they got the task of whisking me away, abandoning me outside the duchy's borders.
   1180184|00000000||They were following orders.
   1180186|00000000||So they were, though they did so eagerly. Especially when I tried to flee… Crespi beat me unconscious with a whip. The others stood by and watched.
   1180188|00000000||Peyran found ample opportunity to take his frustrations out on me. While du Lac and de la Croix insulted me, mocked me. I swore then I would never forget. I would find them. Find them all.
   1180646|00000000||Hmm. Explains a bit, a lot. You had a right to feel rage, resentment. But those motives aren't enough to justify the means you chose.
   1180192|00000000||Now I understand.
   1180191|00000000||That's no excuse.
   1180289|00000000||Didn't have it easy, give you that much. Still no excuse for what you did.
   1186931|00000000||Because you envy her.
   1186936|00000000||You envy her. Her power, her beauty, the love of her people.
   1186930|00000000||Curse of the Black Sun.
   1186934|00000000||How should I know? Might really be the Curse of the Black Sun. Word is cursed princesses often kill their own families.
   1186945|00000000||I see I misjudged you. You understand nothing.
   1186947|00000000||Well, what now? Off to share your discovery with Anna Henrietta? She's no longer in danger, true, but she very well might add a little something to your reward.
   1186949|00000000||Definitely gonna tell her. Not necessarily for the coin, though.
   1186951|00000000||Then why do it at all?
   1186953|00000000||She oughta know. If only 'cause you'll probably try to kill her again if she ever lets you out.
   1187107|00000000||I probably will.
   1187159|00000000||I was only ever nice to you to get you to sleep with me. I thought you might come in handy one day.
   1187147|00000000||Like hurting people, don't you.
   1187155|00000000||Enjoy hurting people, that it? Sorry, but won't give you the satisfaction. The witcher mutations, you know. It's hard to draw my blood.
   1187157|00000000||Don't worry. I'll find a way.
   1187109|00000000||Ever thought to forgive her?
   1187124|00000000||Perhaps, just for a second, you could stop dwelling on all the wrongs folk've done you - and forgive her?
   1187126|00000000||Why should I?
   1187187|00000000||She was a child.
   1187205|00000000||Syanna… you were exiled when she was how old? Twelve? Thirteen? She was a child.
   1187207|00000000||What was she supposed to do? Rebel, organize a coup? Steal your father's seal and forge a pardon?
   1187209|00000000||She was powerless. Wiped you from her memory not because she didn't care, but because your departure was traumatic for her. She forgot 'cause that was the only way she could handle the pain.
   1187215|00000000||Argh… you really want a happy ending, don't you?
   1187211|00000000||Ahh, with all of us living happily ever after…
   1187221|00000000||Go, witcher. Or they'll give your medal to another. And that would be a shame.
   1187223|00000000||Farewell, Syanna.
   1187213|00000000||Argh… You meant what you said in the Land of a Thousand Fables. You really want a happy ending to this story, don't you?
   1187199|00000000||Don't know. But you could just ask her instead of sending monsters after her.
   1187201|00000000||There's nothing she could say to change what she did to me, to justify it.
   1187203|00000000||Maybe. But there's nothing out there to justify what you did to her and all Toussaint. Yet Anna Henrietta hasn't given up on you.
   1187186|00000000||Might ask her that.
   1187128|00000000||For old time's sake. You loved each other, once.
   1187130|00000000||Pshh. Please. I don't know who fed you that rubbish, but--
   1187132|00000000||Read your governess' diary. You played together, were inseparable. Anarietta'd get you in trouble sometimes, sure… But there were also times she stood up for you. When you had nightmares, only she could calm you.
   1187134|00000000||Time eats away at memories, distorts them. Sometimes we only remember the good… sometimes only the bad.
   1187185|00000000||If she loved me so, why did she wash her hands of me? Forget me? Hm?
   1187136|00000000||She's your sister, dammit.
   1187139|00000000||You know, before they drove me from my home, I received an education befitting one of my status. Music, poetry, arithmetic… As well as logic.
   1187141|00000000||So with complete certainty I can state that the opinion "you must forgive your sister because she is your sister" is utter bollocks.
   1187143|00000000||No. I will not forgive her. Nor shall I show remorse or promise to improve. Anything else? Or will you finally leave me in peace?
   1187161|00000000||Have a nice life, Syanna.
   1187149|00000000||I like this game. Long as we're being honest, here I go - you're a pathetic, self-centered snake.
   1187152|00000000||Should I go on? You'll rot in this tower. You'll die of old age. Embittered, alone and forgotten. By everyone.
   1187146|00000000||And you're a pathetic, petty viper.
   1187145|00000000||Your comrade Regis is using you. And Anna Henrietta perceives you solely as her unthinking, blunt instrument. She's right to, you know.
   1187122|00000000||I only slept with you because I thought I could use you one day.
   1187112|00000000||Least you're being honest. Finally.
   1187114|00000000||Lying only ever makes sense when there's a chance someone will believe you.
   1187116|00000000||It's actually refreshing, in a way - to say what I truly think. So why don't I do a bit more?
   1187108|00000000||Ah, honesty, finally.
   1187110|00000000||Think I've heard enough.
   1187118|00000000||Know what…? Don't feel like talking to you anymore. This is pointless.
   1187120|00000000||Finally something we can agree on. Farewell, Geralt.
   1195135|00000000||Let's go. Wanna see him, too.
   1196387|00000000||Yeah. Let's go.
   1195137|00000000||Need to tend to one thing, first. I'll look in on him afterwards.
   1196384|00000000||So be it.
   1196388|00000000||Need to tend to something.
   1196386|00000000||Commander de la Tour would like to see you. Shall we go at once?
   1177076|00000000||Enough. Your visit's done.
   1187657|00000000||Ah, thank the stars.
   1186401|00000000||I didn't expect you to understand. I need no sympathy, not from you, not from anyone. I regret nothing.
   1186403|00000000||If I could turn back time, I'd not decide otherwise at any juncture. They all deserve to be punished. My sister most of all.
   1180166|00000000||Not particularly interested in your motives.
   1180168|00000000||Of course not. You're all about killing, not listening.
   1180133|00000000||Don't care about your excuses.
   1166695|00000000||Regis, he's always saying Dettlaff was more animal-like, less human than him. Might've been so. Dettlaff acted on reflex, was driven by primordial instincts.
   1166734|00000000||Whereas you're driven by cruelty, hatred and a lust for vengeance. They hired me to kill the Beast, true. Thing is, something tells me the real Beast is you.
   1180132|00000000||You've no notion who I am or what drives me.
   1166673|00000000||Dettlaff wasn't the Beast.
   1166486|00000000||Went to a place where Beauclair's beggars congregate. Found proof that you'd planned your sister's demise.
   1166490|00000000||Anna Henrietta - she was Dettlaff's ultimate target from the start. Your target.
   1180316|00000000||Bravo, witcher. I congratulate you on your deductive reasoning skills. But what I'd planned has nothing to do with you.
   1180318|00000000||Wrong. Has everything to do with me.
   1180320|00000000||You were hired to kill the Beast. Said Beast is dead. So go collect your medal and leave me alone! Why must you meddle in everything?!
   1159645|00000000||Met some beggars. Learned something interesting.
   1159646|00000000||This place - not that bad as a prison cell.
   1180162|00000000||This cell… downright cozy. Second time you've been incarcerated in altogether pleasant conditions. Always seem to land on your feet.
   1180164|00000000||I wouldn't say that… I get no privacy here. But it is clean. Because I cleaned it.
   1160170|00000000||They do say cleaning can be relaxing.
   1160172|00000000||It isn't. It's a horrible, thankless task. But I'm not one to leave anything undone. For instance, before I left Nazair, I also tidied up my room. Even made my bed.
   1177072|00000000||I knew I'd never return, but I despise leaving unfinished business, messes, loose ends.
   1180109|00000000||Dogged determination. Guess that's admirable.
   1180111|00000000||I was praised for it as a little girl… Only for that, in fact.
   1150671|00000000||Hey, Syanna. Sorry to intrude, but I gotta ask you something.
   1150673|00000000||I've nothing to say to you. You're the one who put me in here, have you forgotten?
   1186373|00000000||Sure, but you are here, so what's the harm in talking? Got something better to do?
   1187631|00000000||What do you want? Be brief.
   1186929|00000000||Oh, too late to worry about that. The witcher and I have done irregular things aplenty already.
   1186916|00000000||Have you come to see how I fare? I'm fine, thank you. Artorius' ribbon worked wonders. It's a shame they took it from me, for--
   1186918|00000000||I know who the fifth victim was supposed to be.
   1186921|00000000||Goodness, you're simply a compulsive snoop! I'm in prison. Dettlaff is dead… Could you not just drop it?
   1186923|00000000||Syanna… Stop pretending you couldn't care less. I know it's an act - and it's really starting to wear.
   1186925|00000000||Why'd you want to kill her?
   1186927|00000000||Tsk, tsk. For such an accomplished investigator to ask about the obvious…? Come, now, Geralt. Why do you think?
   1186932|00000000||Cause she turned her back on you, forgot about you.
   1186941|00000000||Because she turned her back on you. Then banished all memory of you.
   1186943|00000000||Bravo, Geralt. Yet another riddle solved - and your sick curiosity sated.
   1177056|00000000||Wanna talk to her, plain and simple.
   1177066|00000000||Wanna talk to her. It's important.
   1177068|00000000||Want to talk? Go see your gran at teatime. Not one locked up on the duquessa's orders. No doing without special permission. Period.
   1186356|00000000||Found some information important to her case. Need an explanation. Urgently.
   1177062|00000000||Agh… fine, then. You're that witcher who solved the murders, no? Then you've my permission. But only for a few minutes.
   1177064|00000000||Promise to be brief.
   1177058|00000000||Need to interrogate her. New facts have come to light. Need them explained. Seems she was planning your duquessa's assassination.
   1177055|00000000||She's suspected of planning the duchess' assassination.
   1172822|00000000||Halt!
   1172824|00000000||Need to see Syanna. Urgently.
   1172826|00000000||In the matter of…?
   1166681|00000000||Can't help it, it's who I am. I see someone being cruel, vile, sword just seems to draw itself.
   1185130|00000000||You speak as if you've never done anything loathsome yourself.
   1185132|00000000||Never intentionally.
   1207781|00000000||Geralt, hail!
   1207783|00000000||Salutations, witcher.
   1207791|00000000||Honor, wine and country!
   1207793|00000000||Salutations, witcher.
   1207795|00000000||For Toussaaaint! For the duuuucheeeess!
   1207787|00000000||Honor, wine and country!
   1207789|00000000||For Toussaaaint! For the duuuucheeeess!
   1207785|00000000||Launfaaaaal!

   1208900|1920c406||Nilfgaardian Sailor
   1177658|00000000||Then this brute simply vanished, dropped off the face of the earth, though in his case "turned to vapor" might be the better phrase.
   1159127|00000000||We gonna report for this laundry duty? Rather get it over with.
   1159137|00000000||Away we go. Personally, I'm pleased we're assigned to it. Those rags stink like sick in the sun, but you get used to it. And when you're working, you get more bread.
   1159124|00000000||We gonna report for laundry duty?
   1159125|00000000||What're you in for?
   1159129|00000000||Why'd they lock you up?
   1159131|00000000||A hodge-podge. I had no domicile but had to winter somewhere. So I robbed a shopkeeper - couldn't have made a worse mistake. The penalty was a fine, an amount I couldn't pay. So they switched it to lashes, meted out on my bum.
   1159135|00000000||After that, I shifted course, started pinching bigwigs' noses. Cut the tail of Count Bovieaux's steed, got a year and half for that. My next exploits had to be grander, even greater wrongs. So I carefully chose my victim - Marshal de Lastaic.
   1169774|00000000||Filled his casque with dung from between my very own cheeks. That got me three years of free room and board. I'll pull another prank as soon as they let me out. Made it a career, it's become my way of life.
   1177660|00000000||Hm. Seem pretty well informed.
   1177662|00000000||Best informed mutt in this kennel, paws down. Duquessa's cross, no doubt, while you await your trial. Though she never seemed concerned for her sister before.
   1177664|00000000||Since you seem to know so much, tell me one last thing - my sentence, what'll it be?
   1177666|00000000||None can tell you that, Anarietta's a fickle cocotte. There's just no knowing which teet she's like to flash.
   1177668|00000000||But I'd advise against escape. You're a prisoner among many, now. Take flight, though, make it out - public enemy number one.
   1177656|00000000||Lucky, then, you managed to cut the murderer down. The court could very well cast a kinder eye on your case.
   1159075|00000000||You know me? How?
   1159077|00000000||Know? That's a stretch. No, I wouldn't say that, no. But I do know they've assigned you to the laundry, same as me. And I know what you're in for, your dastardly deed. Then again I know that about every jester who winds up here.
   1159079|00000000||Hm. Kinda curious to know what you know, or think you know.
   1159081|00000000||The duquessa hired you to find the Butcher of Beauclair. And you did, but then you let him butcher dear Anarietta's sis.
   1159071|00000000||Know me?
   1159099|00000000||What can you get me, exactly?
   1159101|00000000||Exactly? Anything a patron of this little auberge might desire. From decent vittles that won't stew your innards to a dab of fissty to make you fly.
   1177638|00000000||Even brought in a slinky piece of arse once. A boarder claimed to suffer from glandular over activity or somesuch.
   1159115|00000000||You see, out there beyond the walls, I'm a lowly dogsbody. But here in the klingdom of the clink, I'm the kling.
   1159072|00000000||What can you get?
   1159073|00000000||Don't need a thing.
   1159121|00000000||Can't readily think of anything.
   1159123|00000000||Come, now, mate. We all need something. You've just not been in here long enough to know.
   1177636|00000000||Ey there! Geralt of Rivia!
   1159068|00000000||What do you want?
   1159070|00000000||Me? Not a thing. Name's Handsome Jacques and I've already got it all. What I wonder is if there's anything you'd need.
   1084926|cf7152db||Armorer
   1185980|00000000||Tailoring is an art, an art which a great many know, yet very few understand.
   1195246|00000000||Pfff.
   1195248|00000000||Ahoy.
   1195250|00000000||Greetings.
   1195252|00000000||Huh?
   1195254|00000000||Uh-huh?
   1195256|00000000||Eh.
   1195258|00000000||Argh.
   1195260|00000000||Fuck.
   1195266|00000000||Fuck!
   1195262|00000000||Go wave that round somewhere else.
   1195264|00000000||Nooo!
   1187354|00000000||Sir… be careful, will you?
   1198652|00000000||Oh, yes! They said the same at the auberge!
   1198650|00000000||Bah! The claptrap you repeat after others…
   1187360|00000000||Gray, yes, scraggly, yes, but at the tourney - he knew no equal…
   1187362|00000000||Well, witcher, without you, Toussaint would be in a sorry state. Oh, sorry indeed!
   1200360|00000000||To reconcile, that's one thing, but to start making wine together? It boggles the mind!
   1198893|00000000||Oh, I hate those Vermentino worms…
   1187358|00000000||*Sniffs* You smell that? Those are the vapors of Toussaint!
   1187356|00000000||The duchy's small, but do you know any who's not heard of our wines?
   1187364|00000000||But how?! And why?!
   1198656|00000000||I hear they've still not cleaned all the blood off the city streets after the vampire attack… It flowed down the gutters in torrents!
   1198658|00000000||When the Beast came for Sir de Peyrac-Peyran, the knight dropped his sword and tried to run, but with all that armor, he didn't get far…
   1198654|00000000||Up Lynx Crag, there's this witch who steals little ones, grinds their bones to flour and bakes gingerbread biscuits out of it!
   1187368|00000000||So? How do you like it here?
   1187366|00000000||Good day!
   1189927|00000000||Myself, I like Count Monnier's idea.
   1196468|00000000||Fool. Who needs a new faction? Gwent is an old game. That's its strength - tradition.
   1196470|00000000||Sooner or later, everything old dies. That is why the new must come. It makes no sense to fight it.
   1196472|00000000||Say you're right. Still, you think you'll convince the dwarves? They won't listen. They'll just crack your skull.
   1186107|00000000||Did Her Grace truly grant you a vineyard?!
   1186109|00000000||Our hero, the Beastslayer!
   1186103|00000000||A smashing place we have, eh? Wine by the barrel, peace and quiet, lovely views…
   1186105|00000000||Eat, drink and loosen your belt! For you are in Toussaint!
   1192992|00000000||Those friends of history, de Savarin's oddballs… The word is they got drunk and went at each other's throats! That, or some monsters ate them…
   1192994|00000000||Yes… So the witcher's supposed to have cleared the cemetery. Brought an end to those eerie nighttime noises - they say it was wraiths arguing!
   1192990|00000000||Have you heard? Some madman's been running about the docks, waving his bare noodle at the merchants.
   1186113|00000000||Witcher! Are you mad?!
   1186117|00000000||Lebioda keep you, from hangovers, too!
   1186111|00000000||Greetings.
   1192996|00000000||It can't be!
   1192998|00000000||You're taking the piddle!
   1186115|00000000||Behave yourself!
   1166317|00000000||We shall wait here, Master Fabricio…
   1188900|00000000||I… I did nothing wrong…
   1185110|00000000||Not to worry. I will see to him.
   1193428|00000000||Calm down… What is it?
   1042932|7391c71d||Actor
   1205744|00000000||Help a poor soul.
   1163255|00000000||Gray-haired puppy knobber.
   1163257|00000000||I'll braid your guts around your spine!
   1163259|00000000||Shism, that hurt!
   1163253|00000000||Gone loony, have you?
   1163263|00000000||Your breath! It smells like you've been eating corpse, friend.
   1163261|00000000||Scarper, now.
   1163267|00000000||A courtesan is like a rat catcher - good for when the pussy at home grows too fat! Harharhar!
   1163265|00000000||You're not afraid of the blessed Beast, are you?
   1194740|00000000||See, sugarpuss…? You banished the Beast, but duchess dumped you in the dungeon. Heheheheh.
   1180869|00000000||{Àite fúlnes bloedde, n'esse fion…} [This place stinks of blood, not wine…]
   1180867|00000000||{Brr, gabh sgranthil ploeige…} [Brrr, this place gives me the willies…]
   1180871|00000000||Tread cautiously out there, witcher.
   1180873|00000000||Don't be fooled. This city is… rotten.
   1105346|00000000||Ugh… Didn't stand a chance. Had to end this way.
   1192878|00000000||Beast knocked his torch away. Must not like fire too much.
   1194784|00000000||You're dandy.
   1194786|00000000||Hey!
   1194788|00000000||Jolly!
    472755|a377ce9b||Young Woman
   1185903|00000000||Listen. I'm a witcher. I'm here to help you. But if that's gonna happen, you gotta answer some questions first.
   1185808|00000000||Who're you?
   1185809|00000000||Who're "they"?
   1196023|00000000||Dammit… rather not expose you to danger.
   1196033|00000000||Dammit. Can't risk, can't expose you to danger…
   1196036|00000000||M-master. If what you say is true, th-then I was the cause of this massacre. Unintentionally… yet nonetheless. I've a duty to assist you, a moral one.
   1196038|00000000||Gods have us in their care… I shall help as well.
   1196030|00000000||Let's get to work. Start by clearing the corpses. Got some time… won't start the reenactment before nightfall. Things of this sort're a lot more likely to work after dusk.
   1205680|00000000||One last thing, though - my pay. Don't work for free, you know.
   1205682|00000000||Understood. J-just keep the danger at b-bay, and I shall be generous, th-through and through.
   1196025|00000000||You know what I'm gonna ask for. Need your help. But I'll understand if you turn me down.
   1196028|00000000||No objections? Good.
   1196022|00000000||Can I count on your help?
   1185912|00000000||Hm. So… while reenacting a scene from the past, somehow, unintentionally, you summoned a specter. A corgowrath or a tsoob, maybe…
   1185935|00000000||What… what now?
   1185937|00000000||Best thing? You gotta do it again, of course.
   1185931|00000000||Are you mad? Would you have this thing… kill us?
   1185933|00000000||No. Don't want it to kill anyone. Precisely why I gotta do my job - summon it again, whatever it is, and tend to it once and for all. Durand, think I can reenact the pledge, the giving of homage, alone?
   1185953|00000000||It w-was a great, momentous event - the surrender of Toussaint's last elven king. You will need at least three individuals.
   1185811|00000000||You mentioned "them." Who'd you mean?
   1185813|00000000||Those… I-I don't know what they were. Sp-spirits? It all occurred of a sudden…
   1185815|00000000||We were staging a s-scene - D-Divethaf paying homage. Th-there was a flash of light that blinded me completely. I heard cries, though saw nothing… Then felt my own robes were in flames.
   1185817|00000000||I broke and ran, threw off my doublet, leapt in here and… shut and locked the door behind me.
   1201346|00000000||They pounded on the door. I-I thought they would get through, I thought I was done for. But… but in the end, it grew calm.
   1185898|00000000||Who are you, exactly?
   1185900|00000000||D-durand Faucher-Plamondon de S-savarin. Lord of these lands… and chairman of the Society of Friends of the History of Toussaint.
   1185904|00000000||We meet here annually, to mark the anniversary of the Elven Homage. But something like this… why, it's a first.
   1185789|00000000||Perhaps there's no one inside after--
   1185791|00000000||I know you're in there. Breathing's loud and clear. Open up. We mean you no harm.
   1185807|00000000||Th-they… re-remain there?
   1183908|00000000||The sculptures… they came alive? By what witchcraft?
   1183910|00000000||Dunno. Specialize in killing monsters. Reviving them - not so much.
   1185025|00000000||I… I may know what happened. The statues, you see, once stood in the palace of one Divethaf. I acquired them a month past because-- Err, perhaps I should start at the beginning.
   1186159|00000000||This Divethaf was to pay tribute to humans, producing statues of this sort each year. Yet… he did so but once, for he perished in the massacre of nonhumans at the foot of Mount Gorgon in the year seven hundred and eighty-two.
   1185092|00000000||It's fortunate he did, too, as Divethaf had planned Ludovic's downfall. For he sculpted not statues but golems that masqueraded as such, golems activated with words said in homage… golems that would have turned the king and his bodyguards into so much colorful confetti.
   1186161|00000000||Typical… Treachery embodied, elves. Ptooey.
   1186220|00000000||Beast's dead, Path awaits. High time I was on my way.
   1186183|00000000||Hold, master! Please, take this.
   1186185|00000000||A safe journey to you, witcher.
   1186164|00000000||Time for me to go.
   1186163|00000000||Humans're no better.
   1186195|00000000||You're no better. Elves were just defending their territory. You humans took it, but you still weren't sated… Had to cut the elves down, every last one.
   1186222|00000000||"You" - what does that mean? You're a man as we are.
   1186224|00000000||Yeah. In a way. Just ashamed to have to admit it sometimes.
   1186227|00000000||Your words - they're wrong, witcher. But I'll not let you leave empty-handed. Take this - your reward.
   1186230|00000000||Farewell.
   1196698|00000000||You would do best to leave, resume your Path, master.
   1188902|00000000||Don't interrupt.
   1189499|00000000||I-I will stand, or rather s-sit, in for K-king Ludovic… upon the elven throne. While you, witcher, will play the Aen Seidhe ruler. W-we must don the costumes, all must be just right.
   1189503|00000000||"Divethaf, the elven king, hosted Ludovic in his own palace, upon his own throne… amidst the blinding glow of a plethora of torches."
   1182376|00000000||It's a shame about that duchess of theirs, no? A lovely lass, she was…
   1182374|00000000||Graytufts! Were you at the tourney? It true this Geralt of Riv was crowned champion?
   1182370|00000000||Hey, graylocks, do you ever eat… snails?
   1182372|00000000||{Esse'pheòr, hwone, bloede, sàilre…} [I wonder when the blazes we will sail out…]
   1182378|00000000||{Va calm, Nordling!} [Calm down, Nordling!]
   1182380|00000000||{Va vort!} [Get out of my way!]
   1182384|00000000||Stick a baguette up your arse. Hahahaha!
   1182382|00000000||The things they gorge upon here… Nordlings…
   1193528|00000000||Run!
   1193522|00000000||I'm not afraid.
   1184903|00000000||I wish I was a boy…
   1184905|00000000||My brother gave me a sword! I named it Needle!
   1184901|00000000||I dreamt I was a wolf!
   1184909|00000000||Is it true? Is winter coming?
   1184907|00000000||Do you know how to swing a sword left-handed? I do!
   1159161|abff91fb||Armand
   1124207|00000000||Witcher! The matter with Vivienne - have you reconsidered? You, of all those I know, could find a way to help her!
   1124188|00000000||Your wound? Feeling better?
   1124190|00000000||It's healing splendidly, though I'm to avoid trouble for some time. To be frank, that is precisely why I wished to speak with you.
   1124192|00000000||Want me to stand in for you, take on some trouble on your behalf?
   1124194|00000000||That could very well be the case. You see, there is a maiden - nay, a lady. I suspect someone's cast an ill spell upon on her. A curse, perhaps.
   1130788|00000000||Bet I can guess her symptoms.
   1130808|00000000||Lemme guess - she suddenly grew cold, haughty and distant, though the night before she was flirtatious and alluring?
   1130810|00000000||Tut-tut, witcher - you jest, yet the matter is grave. Though, true, the lady in question is dear to my heart - I shall not deny it.
   1130820|00000000||I fear she has fallen victim to ill magic, and knows no one she could turn to for help.
   1130787|00000000||She cursed? What makes you think so?
   1130848|00000000||What makes you think she might be cursed?
   1130850|00000000||You must keep all I say to yourself, I beg you. I would never dare to be so indiscreet, normally, yet I am troubled about her, for her.
   1156013|00000000||Vivienne shuns the company of others. Though the fairest maid at court, she keeps men at a distance. I thus determined I would resort to trickery…
   1156015|00000000||Trickery? That even befitting of a knight?
   1156017|00000000||In war - yes. And what is love, if not battle? As it were, one evening I crouched in hiding outside her seamstress' home. As Vivienne emerged from it, I too emerged, ever so gently but convincingly collided with her, then promptly offered to escort her home.
   1130852|00000000||She consented. At first, all augured well. I proposed a more scenic route, she agreed. I made kindly forays into conversation, and she even began to respond as we neared the end of our route…
   1156198|00000000||Then suddenly…
   1130854|00000000||Then suddenly, mid-speech, from her mouth there flew a most hideous shriek. I stopped stone-cold in my tracks, while she turned red, then promptly ran off. I did not give chase… that time.
   1179749|00000000||I attempted to approach her on several ensuing occasions. To learn what had happened, for I feared she had become entangled in some trouble.
   1179751|00000000||I noted that often, come night, she ventures into the woods, where I've seen her walk about a glade near a pool. I've striven on occasion to follow her, but lost track each time. It seemed then she'd melted into the air.
   1124185|00000000||Sound might not've been as strange as you remember.
   1131066|00000000||Sound you heard - she mighta just had a sore throat.
   1131070|00000000||Had I thought it possible the sound was natural, I never would have taken up your precious time.
   1124186|00000000||Notice anything else unusual?
   1131075|00000000||Notice any other strange behavior, additional symptoms?
   1131077|00000000||No, Vivienne's avoided me wholly since the first encounter. But folk gossip…
   1156448|00000000||What about?
   1156450|00000000||They say she's secretive, that no one ever sees her after dusk, that she's wont to suddenly disappear…
   1156452|00000000||Nothing unusual about any of that.
   1124184|00000000||Anything else you can tell me about her?
   1124209|00000000||Tell me more about Vivienne? Who is she, what's her story?
   1124211|00000000||She is Her Enlightened Highness' lady in waiting. Her mother was a lady-in-waiting, her father, a knight. That is all I've learned, for the duquessa grows angry when asked about her. Vivienne spends her days within the palace walls.
   1130888|00000000||Yet we are in luck, for she has been named the tourney's patroness this year. Thus, each participant will be granted an audience with her.
   1130890|00000000||Got a problem, then. See, I'm not a participant.
   1130892|00000000||I've devised a solution, already. You shall take my place in the lists and thus gain the chance to speak to her.
   1130894|00000000||I was looking forward to winning the tourney, very much so, yet for Vivienne, I'm prepared to sacrifice anything!
   1131063|00000000||Tell me more about this tourney.
   1131061|00000000||This tourney - how's it work, exactly?
   1131072|00000000||It is the year's grandest and most important contest! Knights from all corners come to face off for the grand prize - and more importantly, for glory.
   1131094|00000000||A demanding test of knightly prowess in horsemanship, marksmanship and fencing. I qualified for the first time, had great hopes of winning.
   1131096|00000000||Yet--
   1194911|00000000||Yeah, I get it. Anything for Vivienne.
   1185043|00000000||Let's talk about my reward, first.
   1173970|00000000||Hardly your regular job, this. Not often I gotta take part in a tourney to fulfill a contract. Fee can't be anything ordinary, either.
   1173972|00000000||I am no magnate to command heaps of coin. But naturally, I shall award you a just amount. How much do you demand?
   1173974|00000000||Vivienne is worth every copper. But this amount I simply do not have. You ask too much.
   1173976|00000000||I have comrades I can ask, they would surely lend me coin, yet even that would not be enough. Could you not lower your fee somewhat?
   1173980|00000000||The matter is of grave importance to me, yet you clearly jest, continue to mock. We shall reach no agreement this way.
   1173978|00000000||Agreed. That is an amount I can indeed muster.
   1131934|00000000||Horsemanship?
   1131939|00000000||Roach could use some wind in her mane. Let's go for a ride.
   1131935|00000000||Let's try sword fighting.
   1131941|00000000||How about some swordplay?
   1131937|00000000||Marksmanship. Feel a need to do some shooting.
   1131933|00000000||Target practice.
   1137716|00000000||Apply all the skills you mentioned on a daily basis. And against monsters, not targets and dummies.
   1156713|00000000||Don't need any training. Going straight to the tourney grounds to sign up.
   1137710|00000000||Don't need any practice, don't need to train.
   1131932|00000000||I shall be forever in your debt! Now, we must ensure you are not eliminated from the tourney before you can meet Vivienne.
   1156711|00000000||Meaning?
   1134751|00000000||Could you show me how you shoot, ride and fight, perchance? And you must learn the tourney rules, know how to apply them in practice.
   1134753|00000000||I-I did not mean to suggest I doubt your abilities. Everyone must train, even a witcher.
   1178059|00000000||Besides, the tourney contests must surely differ, require skills you don't usually apply. Races, above all. The choice is yours… where shall we start?
   1124213|00000000||Fine. I'll look into it. Gotta admit, piqued my curiosity.
   1131062|00000000||Agreed. You got me curious.
   1131064|00000000||I won't do it.
   1124181|00000000||All sounds pretty interesting, I guess. Still, can't look into Vivienne's troubles just now.
   1124183|00000000||I see - state matters take priority. Yet come see me forthwith should you have a change of heart.
   1124179|00000000||Witcher! I've a matter of prime urgency and import! I must speak to you!
   1211162|27c7b0f2||Camerlengo
   1190485|00000000||You are the bravest of us. Your name will live forever.
   1190487|00000000||Better to avenge Sir Milton than to indulge in mourning.
   1190483|00000000||The time of heroes is dead, witcher. We men are the monsters now.
   1190481|00000000||To kill a brave man is an ignoble deed…
   1190493|00000000||The gods shall not let me die on your blade!
   1190491|00000000||I am the Gutter, the Reaper, the Cleaver and the Gouger!
   1190489|00000000||Do you think yourself the first to seek to kill me?
   1198467|00000000||The duchy's time has come to an end. When we buried the duchess, we buried Toussaint.
   1190495|00000000||How might I help you?
   1190497|00000000||Witcher.
   1190499|00000000||What is this uproar?
   1214319|00000000||A horse is more to a witcher than merely a means of locomotion – just ask any bandit who has taken a well-aimed hoof to the head during combat. Additionally, many a witcher has talked over the nuts and bolts of his current contract with his horse while staring at the stars shining above the lonely road, though Few would ever admit to this.<br><br>Geralt named his every mount Roach, though no one really knows why or what Geralt had in mind with this name. When asked, Geralt would dodge the question or give an evasive answer. Perhaps this had just been the first word that came to his head? Roach, for her part, seemed to accept the name with no reservations.<br><br>Geralt would grow annoyed and curse whenever Roach panicked and tossed him in the middle of a battle, as well as when she would suddenly turn a different direction than he wanted while he was riding at full gallop towards some urgent destination. In truth, though, he was very attached to her and would never trade her for any other horse. Not even one which, when summoned, would never stand helpless in front of a seemingly easily surmountable obstacle, such as a low fence or stray piece of timber. Nor even one which would sometimes, in some incomprehensible fashion, wind up dancing on some peasant’s roof. ”Well,” Geralt would say with a shrug. “A witcher’s horse isn’t a normal animal. Constant contact with magic beverages and Signs must have left a mark.”<br><br>
   1214320|00000000||While completing a contract in Toussaint, Geralt had the chance to find out exactly how serious Roach took her role and how well-versed in the arcana of the witcher’s trade she was. He also discovered she was an entirely pleasant conversation partner.
   1214318|00000000||Roach
   1191832|00000000||You came, you saw, you helped! Thank you, witcher!
   1191777|00000000||To be saved from a terrible fate by Geralt of Rivia himself. My grandpups can't believe it.

   1170607|00000000||Oh, witcher, greetings! To what do I owe the pleasure?
   1170571|00000000||Wouldn't mind a drink, some good wine… or cognac.
   1179258|00000000||Be my guest - pick and choose as you will.
   1168315|00000000||What you got in stock?
   1168323|00000000||Time I was on my way. Farewell.
   1168317|00000000||Farewell.
   1168316|00000000||How's the trade?
   1170612|00000000||Decided not to leave after all.
   1170614|00000000||I had nowhere to go, really, no idea. Apart from which, this is my home.
   1173638|00000000||True, my brothers and I quarreled, fought tooth and nail, until we acknowledged we'd do best to sell all Father had left us. But I try not to complain.
   1173648|00000000||I have my stall, little as it may be, and somehow, life flows slowly onward…
   1168319|00000000||See you made up with your brothers. Looks like business is good…
   1168321|00000000||All true, all true. I cannot complain.
   1170566|00000000||We'd been rivals all our lives, so at first it was hard to agree - on anything! Yet gradually, we realized we had no other options. Suddenly, it turned out we work well together.
   1170568|00000000||Nice to hear.
   1170584|00000000||Hah! And we've you to thank for it! Had we not met you, nothing would have come of our quarrels but heartache. Thank you, witcher.
   1170586|00000000||Glad I could help.
   1168314|00000000||Ooh, witcher, greetings! What brings you here?
   1171169|00000000||Try my cordial. The duchy's best, not a doubt.
   1171181|00000000||Ahh, is this what booming means? Cognac selling like fresh buns on the morn, pleased customers streaming about…
   1171183|00000000||Father's desire that we work together - do you see the wisdom of it, now?
   1171185|00000000||Yes. Papa knew. Papa knew this would work.
   1194388|00000000||Father would be mighty proud.
   1194390|00000000||It's fortunate we resolved our differences, made peace. Had Father's cognac recipe gone to waste, I'd not have forgiven any of us. Such a shame.

   1208574|00000000||Someone's there! Houndies, get the rotsaak!
   1202424|00000000||Leave the hounds!
   1206613|00000000||Then hurry up, verdomme!
   1202637|00000000||Who the foek are you?! At him!
   1206611|00000000||I'll not let them die!
   1208660|00000000||It's nothing, I guess.
   1208662|00000000||So? Will you stay with them?
   1208668|00000000||Of course I am.
   1208666|00000000||You could be right…
   1208664|00000000||Would you foeken rather die in battle?
   1202639|00000000||We did it!
   1208658|00000000||What've you found there?

   1153468|00000000||Geralt himself was of the School of the Wolf, so it's no surprise he was particularly interested in finding diagrams that would allow him to craft grandmaster level gear of this brotherhood. He began his search by visiting elven ruins a certain witcher had visited years before while protecting the members of an archeological expedition.<br>
   1153469|00000000||Geralt's own exploration of the site ended in the cellars beneath the ruins. Our hero learned the scholars had reached a spot haunted by elven specters. Both the learned men and the witcher escorting them had perished at the wraiths' hands. Geralt proved a mite luckier. He not only emerged from the ruins alive, but he also found all the diagrams he had gone there to seek.<br>

   1193372|00000000||Ha! Now, Toussaint's hero, Geralt the Riv - with him I'd drink!
   1171764|00000000||I've had a deep think - time for a drink!

   1207178|00000000||As he was roaming wine country, Geralt was not at all surprised to come upon a vintner. Nor was he surprised to learn the vintner needed a witcher's help…<br>
   1207179|00000000||The vintner had acquired a property that had come with some very nasty tenants - a pack of ghouls. The witcher quickly exterminated the filthy, stinking beasts.<br>

This land was abandoned and left untended for years, during which time it began to rot, fester and degrade.<br><br>The Cloud Giant was most likely meant to be a pleasant-natured strongman who would carry the duke’s young daughters on his shoulders and never grow tired.

   1159251|00000000||Dammit… that was close.
   1159253|00000000||What the hell…? What is this place?!
   1159527|00000000||Incredible… Explains a lot.
   1177103|00000000||I'm… upside down? Gravity's flipped. Getting pulled up instead of down…
   1159525|00000000||Well, well. Someone was here before me.
   1177022|00000000||Mage's letter mentioned the thin border between worlds here… Explains the disruptions in gravity.
   1177117|00000000||Somewhere towards the middle, things're reversed. You fall up, instead of down. Hm, could use that…
   1177026|00000000||Is that stream… flowing upwards? Strange. Clearly worth a look…

   1184495|00000000||Wonder what happened to him.

   1184516|00000000||Hm… Maybe this'll tell me something…
   1184518|00000000||An offering for the Unseen… Damn, could use something like that.
   1184520|00000000||Maybe if I give this to the Unseen Elder, he won't kill me… least not right away.
   1184522|00000000||Doubt the Elder'll be glad to see me…

   1177035|00000000||Hm. That should do the trick.
   1177024|00000000||No way I can climb up there… unless I could give myself a boost.
   1184775|00000000||A waterfall… flowing upwards. What's going on here…?
   1208480|4e8de073||Tailles' Bodyguard
   1195822|00000000||I've heard enough. My word.
   1195854|00000000||Jumping junipers! That's something.
   1183715|00000000||Sir Geralt the Superb slew the Beast, not for glory but to bring the land peace!
   1183717|00000000||Geralt of Rivia, his age notwithstanding, defeated the Beast, a foe most demanding, he then rescued our town of joy and song, from the vile claws of a vampiric throng!
   1183711|00000000||In Toussaint, it is easier to find a bard without a lute than a bard who is sober…
   1183713|00000000||You may write a resounding refrain, or sing a marvelous tune, yet inside your head will remain, an achingly quiet and empty croon.
   1183725|00000000||Behold, a man of the blade.
   1183719|00000000||Greetings!
   1183721|00000000||What's this now?!
   1195826|00000000||The witcher, the recent arrival - he's quite the art lover, apparently. And what he loves most is to pose with his bum bared!
   1195828|00000000||You won't believe it! They say someone snuck up to Reginald d'Aubry's statue and chiseled off his… jewels!
   1195824|00000000||They say Oxenfurt scholars have proved alcohol is bad for our health. And we are to drink naught but… water!
   1183723|00000000||Wait a minute, wait a minute! Aaaaaargh!
   1178406|00000000||Wight that lives here - definitely afflicted by a curse. And it's been trying desperately to lift it.
   1201637|00000000||A spoon key, sophisticated crafting. Tag bears a description.
   1201639|00000000||Wight's a true collector.
   1152730|00000000||Woman's name scratched into this wooden spoon. Romantic…
   1192488|00000000||The monster - journal's author, maybe?
   1178402|00000000||Smashed mirror… as if someone couldn't stand to look at themselves.
   1206194|00000000||Thousands of 'em here. Wight's been a collector for years.
   1152726|00000000||Hm. Actually does seem like a wight's lair. Bit atypical, but still. Cauldron should be somewhere around here…
   1152694|00000000||Regis' raven wasn't lying. Spoons all over the place.
   1152722|00000000||Strange… Get a sense that the spoons are beating out some kind of rhythm, a message… trying to tell me something.
   1178283|00000000||"None shall sit and dine with you at your table, no spoon you have shall sate you, never again shall you wish to spy your reflection in the mirror."
   1198520|00000000||Another spoon. Yup, just as normal as the last one.
   1198518|00000000||Spoon, pretty ordinary, maybe a little old.
   1198516|00000000||Wight's obsessed. A real collector. Thoroughbred.
   1152734|00000000||Cauldron I was looking for. Wight's not particularly tidy…
   1178394|00000000||Table's set… Wight who lives here is getting ready for some sort of feast.
   1193806|00000000||Right arm bit right off. Teeth all knocked out. Somebody tried to force-feed him…
   1193794|00000000||No claw or fang marks. Probably choked to death.
   1152736|00000000||Cauldron's empty, unfortunately. Regis needs some brew. Afraid he won't get that…
   1152738|00000000||No choice but to hide and wait for the saliva glands. And their bearer. Need a spot that'll let me observe the cauldron.
   1178404|00000000||"No spoon you have shall sate you." Whatever lives here treated that literally. Still searching for the right spoon.
   1178396|00000000||Skeletons… Doubt they came here willingly.
   1179957|00000000||This have anything to do with the curse? "None shall sit and dine with you at your table." It'd make sense.
   1188569|00000000||Poor girl… Realized she was changing into a monster, recorded it in her diary. Poignant.
   1152732|00000000||Spoon's incredible, the craftsmanship… Must've graced a rich man's table.
   1201688|00000000||Hm, that's awful pretty… It'll look great in the house.
   1193800|00000000||Broken neck, indentation in the skull's lateral surface. Smacked in the head with something heavy.
   1198347|00000000||What a pigsty. Need to search it, thoroughly. Find a way to collect some wight saliva.
   1152724|00000000||Barghests… Never a good omen.
   1178275|00000000||"None shall sit and dine with you at your table, no spoon you have shall sate you, never again shall you wish to spy your reflection in the mirror."
   1178279|00000000||Sounds like a curse, all right…
   1178281|00000000||Somebody's clearly obsessed.
   1179943|00000000||Regis mentioned the place might be cursed. Can't be a coincidence. Need to look around.
   1197800|00000000||And who won the gwent tourney? The witcher! Who hypnotized all the others, put them to sleep so he could swipe their best cards!
   1197802|00000000||Tufo's owner, Monsieur de Bourbeau, is throwing a ball in celebration. And not because he's rid of the horror in his cellar, but because he's rid of his wife.
   1197798|00000000||This one damsel sent knight after knight into the woods to bring glory to her name. As it turned out, she was working with Fourfingers' hanse, sending the poor fools straight into a trap!
   1186854|00000000||Still waters run deep…
   1186856|00000000||Where are you skittering off to, Silvermane?
   1186858|00000000||You go to one's head, Geralt! Oh, do you ever!
   1186852|00000000||Do you know my favorite wine? It's Geralt of Rivia!
   1197806|00000000||Noooo, that can't possibly be true.
   1197804|00000000||You don't say?
   1186864|00000000||Sugar cookie! Teeheehee.
   1186860|00000000||Hulloooo!
   1186862|00000000||Are you daft?! Calm down!
   1202660|dab6b804||Worker
   1106203|00000000||Well? Go on, stroke them.
   1113532|00000000||You must be jesting. To stroke a stranger? Even if it is just a statue.
   1106205|00000000||Whereas a friend - him you would fondle?
   1106211|00000000||Hrmph.
   1106199|00000000||So, behold the famous Reginald d'Aubry, the man with a donkey's… determination.
   1106201|00000000||He must have been breathtaking, truly… I would so have loved to meet him…
   1106207|00000000||Bah, a statue like any other. A nude chap, nothing extraordinary.
   1106209|00000000||And the genitals - overblown, most certainly.
   1164060|00000000||I for one cannot fathom only ever consorting with the same creatures, day in and day out.
   1164062|00000000||Got a wife?
   1164064|00000000||Yes. What's that got to do with anything?
   1164066|00000000||Nothing, just asking.
   1164052|00000000||Got pretty broad interests for a "man of the city."
   1164054|00000000||I suppose I dabble in my share of things - wine, nature, painting…
   1164056|00000000||I imagine the life of a witcher must be rather more monotonous… with all due respect.
   1164058|00000000||It is. Never boring, though.
   1172216|00000000||How about here?
   1172218|00000000||I don't know… Isn't it a bit close?
   1173460|00000000||Right. We'll find another spot.
   1177766|00000000||Shh. Hear 'em?
   1178025|00000000||We can use that to track them.
   1178021|00000000||It's those, uhh…
   1178023|00000000||Centipedes, giant. Underground, tunnel burrowers. Make a distinct sound.
   1172200|00000000||We're here.
   1172202|00000000||Well, this vantage point's no good. I shan't capture a good image from here.
   1172204|00000000||All right, wait. We'll find you a better spot that's safe, too.
   1172206|00000000||Tread lightly. Giant centipedes sense the softest sounds, the lightest vibrations. You wake one up, it wakes up angry.
   1177640|00000000||Wouldn't rather be out here with those guards of yours?
   1178033|00000000||Haha. You jest! It's deliverance to emerge from under their wings. Believe me. They're overprotective, oppressively so.
   1173424|00000000||I wish to admire the wildlife, preserve it. Not watch them kill it in a fit of misguided fear for my life.
   1171974|00000000||What if the wildlife attacks us?
   1173426|00000000||Then we shall have no other recourse. I do not wish to be something's supper. Do you?
   1173428|00000000||But as long as they remain calm, we've no need to provoke them. It's of the utmost importance to me, in fact.
   1173070|00000000||Sh. Heard something. Grunting, panting… something like a bear's.
   1173231|00000000||Ooh, I'm not the least bit eager to come face to mug with a bear. We should move on..
   1173058|00000000||Ohh, that's lovely! Now if they could just splay their tails…
   1173517|00000000||See what I can do.
   1173519|00000000||Find a good spot.
   1160109|00000000||I'll try tossing a bomb or casting a Sign. And you watch out, don't get any closer.
   1154785|00000000||Can you lure them out?
   1160107|00000000||Gimme a minute, need to think… Vibrations - gotta send some through the ground.
   1185425|00000000||Damn poachers. Snares - looks like they were hoping for a bear. Panther got caught instead.
   1186264|00000000||Look, a cub. Will you help the mother?
   1186266|00000000||Give it a shot. Gotta calm her first. Likely to lunge at us otherwise.
   1186800|00000000||Brilliant. You freeing her - a superb image.
   1154781|00000000||Seems like a safe spot.
   1160103|00000000||Safe, perhaps. But it offers no view whatsoever.
   1163529|00000000||Hm. Fine, we'll keep looking.
   1173056|00000000||Ready! Use your magic, witcher!
   1154543|00000000||Aaargh! Geralt, save me!
   1187236|00000000||And folk call witchers heartless… This will put the lie to that!
   1171976|00000000||Map says there should be panthers around here.
   1171978|00000000||Stay close. Keep your eyes peeled.
   1171972|00000000||I've but one request, witcher. Avoid bloodshed if at all possible.
   1173064|00000000||Splendid work, thank you.
   1173066|00000000||So much blood, this is tragic… I made a terrible mistake taking a witcher along.
   1177415|00000000||Parestisomach's upset the animals. Better get out of here.
   1163416|00000000||Oh my, I failed to warn you! Apologies!
   1163418|00000000||The parestisomach has an added lantern! You must look away, or it will blind you!
   1172632|00000000||Lovely. I've exactly what I wanted.
   1173468|00000000||Come, we've disturbed them enough…
   1171986|00000000||Hear that? Panthers.
   1173229|00000000||Frankly, I did not hear a thing. Clearly, your senses are far more acute than mine. I must rely on them.
   1172245|00000000||I thank you. Truly magnificent that was.
   1173472|00000000||We can move on now.
   1172247|00000000||You were to find a place where I would have a good view. Instead, you ran into their lair.
   1173474|00000000||Sorry. Got carried away.
   1154904|00000000||Wait, we were to find a safe place for me first.
   1163546|00000000||Blast it, I see you're simply unreliable.
   1173044|00000000||We're close. Eyes in the back of your head.
   1171992|00000000||You need not have killed her. She had young…
   1171994|00000000||Didn't intend to, believe me. Was worried about your safety. It's why you hired me, isn't it?
   1173438|00000000||Ehh, I suppose you're right. Let's move on. But this time be more cautious, please.
   1171988|00000000||I cannot abide poaching. I'm content you share my love for animals.
   1186802|00000000||An excellent day for capturing moments!
   1156724|00000000||Do not look in my direction!
   1173040|00000000||I was wondering… why peacocks?
   1173042|00000000||My… my daughter is rather fond of them. They will be a treat for her.
   1173062|00000000||No! What are you doing?!
   1173523|00000000||Do not kill them!
   1154972|00000000||Oh, this will be a masterpiece! Smile, please!
   1173054|00000000||Fabulous, we're getting close.
   1173052|00000000||Sh, hear that? They're calling to each other.
   1159926|00000000||You don't truly intend to leave me on my own?
   1159932|00000000||I'm back. Let's go.
   1159934|00000000||Oh, thank the gods. I'd begun to think you'd abandoned me.
   1177646|00000000||Giant centipedes! Dammit!
   1177748|00000000||Where did they come from?!
   1177750|00000000||Must've followed us! Get back!
   1177648|00000000||Watch out! Giant centipedes!
   1177752|00000000||But you killed them already!
   1177754|00000000||Clearly not all! Get back!
   1177760|00000000||See that? Soil's been turned over recently. Smells of fresh peat, too…
   1178019|00000000||Step softly or they'll detect the vibrations. And we don't want them coming too close.
   1177762|00000000||Hm. And what does that mean?
   1177764|00000000||Giant centipede nests, close by.
   1185442|00000000||Exhilarating! Positively exhilarating! Thank you! I've one more request - local peacocks performing their mating ritual. I'd love to see that. Apparently, a flock dwells not far from here.
   1186315|00000000||We can go, just don't count on peeping at them while they mate. Season ended a month back.
   1185444|00000000||Oh, that's terrible. I so wished to capture their splendorous tails in full bloom. Is there nothing you can do if they prove uneager to present? Perhaps challenge them somehow, goad them?
   1186317|00000000||What'd you have in mind? Don't have a tail myself. And I'm not likely to sprout one anytime soon.
   1173509|00000000||My thoughts were more along the lines of witcher magic. They say you can exert influence over lesser creatures.
   1173511|00000000||Ehh, yeah. Guess I can try. Can't promise you anything, though..
   1186319|00000000||Splendid, consider me contented. I cannot pinpoint the flock's location, but a hunter I know told me of a few likely spots. I'll mark them for you.
   1186321|00000000||All right. Let's go find some peacocks.
   1177768|00000000||Sound's loud and clear here. Must be near the nest.
   1173048|00000000||A feather from the rump, coated in suet. Cock shed it recently and the suet's got a distinct scent. Oughta be able to track the flock.
   1173050|00000000||A witcher in action, what a treat to watch…
   1185448|00000000||All over now…
   1185450|00000000||Phew, that was… that was… tense. I believe I've had my fill of excitement for today.
   1159939|00000000||No, no, no, not like that! What have you done?!
   1173072|00000000||Hear that? Deer, I think…
   1173233|00000000||Incredible. Sharp as a razor, your hearing…
   1160225|00000000||Just a few more captures! Keep them above ground!
   1154783|00000000||Here, maybe? Distance seems right, light's not bad either.
   1160105|00000000||Yes, this will work perfectly!
   1086252|00000000||Innkeep
   1193984|00000000||Akh akh akh akh akh…
   1193982|00000000||I'm at a loss.
   1193994|00000000||Ouch!
   1193996|00000000||Leg it, good folk!
   1193998|00000000||Mercy…
   1127124|00000000||Hmm… Strange. Was sure I'd find her here.
   1127126|00000000||Vanished, melted into thin air… And that bird. She a bruxa?
   1166859|00000000||Flew off… Worth going after.
   1173521|00000000||Looks like the bird's leading me somewhere.
   1194405|00000000||No sign of the bird anymore.
   1194407|00000000||Guillaume mentioned a clearing in the woods, Vivienne strolling around it at night. Could find her there.
   1195612|00000000||Bird flew off over the hill. Might be quicker to pass through the cave.
   1163731|00000000||New faction - tell me about it.
   1163734|00000000||These new cards - tell me something about them?
   1163736|00000000||Their design embodies the isles' spirit - the rage-filled potency, the rough, brutal beauty. Famed Skelligers, heroes of lore, berserkers and beasts ogle us from the cards.
   1190843|00000000||Bran Tuirseach is the faction's leader, of course.
   1190845|00000000||And the other famous Skelligers?
   1190847|00000000||Hjalmar and Cerys an Craite, naturally, though not conjoined. Also Hemdall the Hero, the venerable druid Ermion… the list goes on.
   1163732|00000000||New deck - where'd you get the idea?
   1163738|00000000||New deck? Where'd you get the idea? I mean, why bother?
   1163740|00000000||All Beauclair knows me as a great lover and promoter of gwent. My brother, dead for some time now, was known to be the same.
   1189914|00000000||We shared another great passion - travel. Spent a great many years at sea in our youth, marking out our territory, heheh, in multiple corners of the world. Yet the one that truly grabbed us by the stones were the Skellige Isles.
   1189916|00000000||The stormy sea, consumed by a fever, a suicidal awe, dashing itself against somber cliffs - that is the image I retain. It and others like it inspired my brother to devise the new faction.
   1181824|00000000||I assure you, Skellige is just as strong as the other factions. It shall soon be considered canon, of this I'm certain.
   1190154|00000000||I don't know. Always been a Nilfgaard man myself… I must give it some more thought.
   1190156|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. Saw a notice about a gwent tournament…
   1190158|00000000||By all means, you've come to the right place. I am Count Martin Monnier, organizer in chief.
   1199946|00000000||Our tourney's more than mere diversion. We've a mission, see? To spread word of my brother's brainchild - Skellige, a new gwent faction.
   1189980|00000000||Wanna sign up, take part in the tournament.
   1198081|00000000||The tournament - where do I sign up to play?
   1198085|00000000||Right here with me. I've one slot open, but there's a condition - you must use cards of the Skellige faction.
   1199537|00000000||You see, I've already asked a great many seasoned players to do the same. Alas, all fear novelties, disdain process, care too much for the climax, for winning. So they insist on playing with their tried and true decks.
   1198087|00000000||Long story short, you need a sucker who'll risk it, take a stab at proving Skellige's no worse than the established decks. Best way to do that'd be to win this tournament using your brother's cards.
   1199539|00000000||We understand one another perfectly, I see.
   1199584|00000000||Behold this trophy, standing stiff and strong - it could be yours if you win.
   1199968|00000000||Hm, not bad. Could look great in my house - on the sideboard, maybe.
   1198095|00000000||All right. I'll give it a shot, play using the new faction.
   1198097|00000000||That is an exceedingly good rub to my loins!
   1199545|00000000||Just one small adjoinder - I can only provide you a basic Skellige deck. My brother, alas, gave away or lost many key cards.
   1199547|00000000||No chance I can win the tournament with these cards?
   1198099|00000000||An issue easily resolved - you must simply face local gwent competitors, win the missing cards from them. Besides, it would be very good practice for the tournament itself.
   1163758|00000000||Here, the cards I can spare you. Take them, please. The rest I keep for myself, for I, too, intend to play as Skellige.
   1199970|00000000||Already got a good enough deck to play in the tournament as Skellige.
   1199666|00000000||Might I have a peek?
   1199973|00000000||You do, indeed! Come back in two days' time, then - for the start of the tourney.
   1209366|00000000||Just remember, the cards I gave you form but the base deck.
   1163747|00000000||Deal. I'll play using the Skellige deck.
   1163764|00000000||And in a bid to coax you into reconsidering, I shall give you the cards for a core Skellige deck. The rest I keep for myself, for I, too, intend to play as Skellige.
   1169665|00000000||Thanks. So long.
   1163754|00000000||Thanks for the offer, but… not really in the mood to play.
   1163756|00000000||A shame. Though mood has little to do with a real man's performance. The tourney's yet to begin, so should you change your mind, you know where to find me.
   1163748|00000000||Some other time, maybe.
   1163784|00000000||Greetings.
   1163786|00000000||I trust you've reconsidered your decision. Will you try your luck in our tournament, after all?
   1181731|00000000||The tournament - am I too late to sign up?
   1181733|00000000||We've one slot free for anyone willing to play the Skellige deck.
   1178959|00000000||You stand no chance against us!
   1178961|00000000||Let me kill him! Me!
   1178963|00000000||Take cover!
   1178971|00000000||Come on! Come here!
   1195167|00000000||Die, slittickler! For Starling Straggen's hanse!
   1195165|00000000||Die, graycrack! For Loth Halfbreed's hanse!
   1195163|00000000||Die, peckermonger! For Fourfingers' hanse!
   1178967|00000000||Now what? Ehh, feckface?
   1178969|00000000||Why the bumsweat did you come here?!
   1178965|00000000||Nothing like the smell of a good bumbotching.
   1178973|00000000||I'll see you in purgatory!
   1100374|00000000||Reconsidered my terms yet? Shall you afford me the respect I am due?
   1162917|00000000||Yeah? What is it?
   1162919|00000000||Now why does one summon a witcher, hm? To inquire about the gossip currently flowing about the court? I've a problem with a beast.
   1100428|00000000||Ah, you the one posted the notice? Go on, then, spit it out, what's it about?
   1162921|00000000||Right, all ears, then. Tell me about the monster.
   1162925|00000000||Ah-ah-ah! First, my dear witcher, we must establish ground rules. Given the vast difference in our respective social positions, I'm sorry to say I take umbrage at the familiar tone you take.
   1162927|00000000||I expect deference. I expect you to address me as "sir," or, better yet, as Monsieur de Bourbeau.
   1162934|00000000||Listen, friend, there's an enormous difference between us but it's not about status. It's about me having two swords on my back, and you having none.
   1162936|00000000||So I'll call you whatever I want. And you either deal with that or solve your monster problem yourself.
   1162938|00000000||The gall! I shall file a complaint with your guild!
   1162940|00000000||Mhm. Make sure you address it to Customer Service, Kaer Morhen, Kaedwen.
   1173890|00000000||Now talk. Before I change my mind and go.
   1162929|00000000||I'll call you whatever I want.
   1163009|00000000||Fine. I'll do it. Need to look around here, first. Then I'll want to talk to Madame de Bourbeau.
   1163011|00000000||Very well. I shall inform you once she has returned. Meanwhile, the key to the cellar. Just, whatever you do, please do not disturb the wine barrels!
   1102746|00000000||I'll do it.
   1102775|00000000||Come now! Be reasonable!
   1102777|00000000||H-how much? Do you jest?
   1102771|00000000||Hm. Fine, seems I must take the loss. Agreed.
   1102773|00000000||Enough! You shall take what I offer, or I shall seek out another slayer of vermin!
   1162992|00000000||Depends. What kind of reward are we talking about?
   1102747|00000000||First let's talk about my pay.
   1102743|00000000||Need to think it over.
   1103366|00000000||Hm. Gotta think it over.
   1100398|00000000||Hm. If that's how you wanna handle things, so long.
   1162930|00000000||Be back later. if I feel like it.
   1162928|00000000||Fine. Let's get to the point, Monsieur.
   1162932|00000000||Fine… Monsieur de Boorbeau.
   1162949|00000000||The emphasis falls on the last syllable. Bour-BEAU.
   1162951|00000000||Mhm. See now, I'd rather emphasize something else - tell me what this is about, monsieur, or I'll change my mind and go.
   1162953|00000000||Nordlings and their manners… Very well, let us get this over with - something has infested my vineyard.
   1162955|00000000||Mhm. Great, lemme go prepare my "something" oil, then.
   1162957|00000000||I beg your pardon?
   1162959|00000000||Need more information than that. Where was this "something" seen? Any witnesses? Bodies to examine?
   1162961|00000000||Therein lies the rub - none has seen the beast. We've only heard signs of its presence - a strange… scratching and shrieks. Neither are there any corpses to inspect… Men simply disappear without a trace.
   1162962|00000000||Noises - where do they come from?
   1162965|00000000||Noises you mentioned - where do they come from?
   1162967|00000000||Well…. everywhere!
   1176657|00000000||But they're most clearly audible in the wine cellar.
   1162969|00000000||Means the monster must dwell underground… Hmm. When're the noises loudest?
   1162971|00000000||In the night. Just as they were years ago, when the buildings quaked. Another expert agreed to look into the matter then - but was never thereafter seen nor heard of.
   1162963|00000000||The missing men - tell me about them.
   1162980|00000000||Who's disappeared, if you don't mind my asking?
   1162982|00000000||Hm. Most recently, some farmhand, I believe.
   1162986|00000000||Despite the vast difference in your social statuses, do you perchance remember the farmhand's name, monsieur?
   1162988|00000000||Despite the vast difference in social status, you remember the farmhand's name, maybe?
   1162990|00000000||No. You must speak to my wife, she has more collegial relations with the household help… She's away at the moment, visiting her mother, but should return forthwith.
   1162984|00000000||Oh, that should suffice with the questions. Now tell me, will you take the contract - yea or nay?
   1102745|00000000||So, shall you accept the contract? Yea? Nay?
   1156280|00000000||You've taken up enough of my time. You were to go to the cellar!
   1158694|00000000||Might we speak?
   1158692|00000000||Hullo, there! Come here!
   1207859|00000000||Ready. Now to drink…
   1207861|00000000||Hmm. Need to backtrack along her prints, then light the candles in the same order she did.
   1208536|00000000||Wrong.
   1207851|00000000||Hm. Pendant's a key. Could be a locked cubby around here somewhere.
   1207847|00000000||Girl reenacted the marked scene, looks like… then expired. Or did something kill her?
   1207849|00000000||Wonder what'll happen if I reenact the scene.
   1184823|00000000||Olly olly oxen free!
   1184825|00000000||Spittoon! Hospital! Everluce!
   1184821|00000000||One… two… three… Ready or not, here I come!
   1184829|00000000||My turn to hide! You look, now!
   1184827|00000000||Hahaha!
   1147635|00000000||Truly, I can only speak through my paintings.
   1144971|00000000||I hear in Novigrad, dogs drink water with their willies! Har har har!
   1144969|00000000||Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it's off to poke we go, har har har!
   1144973|00000000||Hey! You!
   1144977|00000000||Bluddle-uddle-um-dum…
   1144979|00000000||Knob-rot and cactuses!
   1144975|00000000||Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, strip a witcher of one toe!
   1144983|00000000||Mary had a little lamb, whose fleece was white as snow…
   1144981|00000000||Our little Annie has a cavernous cranny, with room for an army, and two more up her fanny!
   1144985|00000000||Ehh, butt-rot take you!
   1162258|00000000||While unheroically roaming the backcountry that was the Champs-Désolés, our heroic witcher was ambushed by a pack of ne'er-do-well highway robbers.<br>He quickly dispatched the upstart traveler molesters, then prompted by curiosity, searched their encampment. He found an interesting letter.<br>
   1162259|00000000||The bandits had previously ambushed a group of scholars returning from an expedition to the Caroberta Woods. They got their just deserts soon after, when their boat, laden with loot, sank. It now rested somewhere at the bottom of the Sansretour River.<br>
   1162260|00000000||Combining work with pleasure, Geralt plunged into the relaxing, refreshing waters of the Sansretour. He quickly found the sunken boat and emptied the treasure chest hidden within it.<br>
   1207958|00000000||While unheroically roaming the backcountry that was the Champs-Désolés, our heroic witcher came upon an encampment overrun by monsters. The beasts were feeding on the remains of the camp's former inhabitants.<br>Geralt dispatched the bloodthirsty filth, then, prompted by curiosity, searched the camp. He found an interesting letter.<br>
   1162261|00000000||Read the letter containing orders.
   1162262|00000000||Search for the sunken boat.
   1194386|00000000||Waiting for Goe and Doh
    370227|f0d0bf53||Werewolf
   1191769|00000000||It is true… We owe you much, Sir Witcher.

   1207111|f0e07f48||Iron Borg
   1156504|00000000||Evildoers!
   1156506|00000000||Defend yourself, scoundrel!
   1156500|00000000||For Toussaint!
   1156502|00000000||For honor!
   1156508|00000000||Toussaint!
   1156510|00000000||Beauclair!
   1091496|00000000||Wyvern
   1176588|00000000||Ah. I do not sell by the bottle.
   1176586|00000000||Ah, yes? Yes?
   1176592|00000000||The beeeeeest goods around! Bar none!
   1176590|00000000||Cheeeeeap wine!
   1152270|00000000||Nice place.
   1157246|00000000||Isn't it? Offers a lovely view of the valley. On a clear day you can see the outlines of Dun Tynne.
   1157369|00000000||Mhh.A shame.
   1201403|00000000||Syanna!
   1152458|00000000||What did you do…?
   1157382|00000000||What I had to do. What she deserved.
   1157384|00000000||Beauclair will know peace once more. The vampires will have left the city by dawn.
   1157386|00000000||I shall leave as well. Go far away. Far from men.
   1157388|00000000||You can try to stand in my way. Then I shall kill you both, though that is not at all my will. The decision is yours.
   1152464|00000000||You can go. But if ever we meet again…
   1157401|00000000||I shall keep my distance. Believe me.
   1157403|00000000||Geralt, Regis… Farewell.
   1179659|00000000||I'm sorry… I swore to protect her, I know… but it happened so fast.
   1166679|00000000||What have we done…?
   1157406|00000000||Let a killer walk. Isn't that what you wanted from the start, though?
   1166691|00000000||We have to let Anna Henrietta know.
   1157408|00000000||Geralt, you will face--
   1157410|00000000||I know. All the same, we have to inform her.
   1152460|00000000||Leave. Go.
   1152459|00000000||Stand and fight.
   1152462|00000000||Prepare to defend yourself.
   1157399|00000000||No chance. I prefer to attack.
   1157302|00000000||Unseen Elder, let him know we've arrived.
   1157305|00000000||Regis, let the Unseen Elder know we've arrived. Have him summon Dettlaff.
   1157308|00000000||Hinthial cesu, themias.
   1152428|00000000||You didn't manage to find me, so you forced a meeting.
   1157310|00000000||Why?
   1176528|00000000||You know why.
   1176530|00000000||I've tired of guessing your human thoughts. So articulate them or leave me be.
   1157323|00000000||I understand your anger, but you need to stop the attacks in the city. Immediately.
   1157325|00000000||My conditions are clear. I wish to see Rhenawe--
   1157344|00000000||I wish to see Syanna. Yet she is not here.
   1157327|00000000||You know why… The duchess would not release her.
   1157329|00000000||So the duchess must face the consequences.
   1157331|00000000||Dettlaff… please. All this for one woman…?
   1157333|00000000||You understand nothing.
   1157336|00000000||Let us be done with this.
   1157314|00000000||The attacks in the city - stop them, You have to.
   1157313|00000000||Here to kill you.
   1157316|00000000||Came here to kill you.
   1157318|00000000||Brief and to the point… how refreshing.
   1157321|00000000||Well then try, witcher.
   1157372|00000000||The ribbon…
   1157375|00000000||Hah. Seems I've been fooled again.
   1157377|00000000||She will pay for this. Sooner or later, she will pay.
   1157380|00000000||You never should have meddled, witcher.
   1201382|00000000||Rhen…
   1201385|00000000||Syanna. Syanna… I've a question I must ask you.
   1201387|00000000||Did you truly feign it all? That which bound us was a… ruse?
   1201389|00000000||Dettlaff… It's not that simple. I--
   1201392|00000000||Oh no. It's very simple. You either deceived me… or not.
   1201395|00000000||In forgiving you, I grieve, for now we must part.
   1176542|00000000||Let's get ready. Dettlaff'll be here any moment now.
   1157303|00000000||Get ready. Dettlaff'll be here any minute.
   1157273|00000000||Nervous, Syanna?
   1157287|00000000||You nervous?
   1157289|00000000||Mhm. It's always a bit nerve-wracking, meeting an ex. Especially so when said ex is a vampire.
   1157291|00000000||I doubt he'll be in the mood for jests.
   1157293|00000000||I know. Ugh…
   1157296|00000000||May I be honest? Yes, I'm nervous. I really would prefer just to run off. I gave my word I would help, I know, but how much is that worth…?
   1157299|00000000||Yet I owe him this meeting. And that is that.
   1152272|00000000||Is it, though? A ruin like any other, I think.
   1152274|00000000||Ehh, so sensitive, so aware… Honestly, what did Dettlaff ever see in you?
   1157249|00000000||Perhaps he'll tell you himself.
   1157253|00000000||Shame, the reason why we came here.
   1157255|00000000||Yes. Quite the shame.
   1157263|00000000||You angry that I didn't free Syanna?
   1157265|00000000||You angry with me? For not freeing Syanna? For not trying to resolve this peacefully?
   1157267|00000000||Hm. A bit.
   1157270|00000000||Though… perhaps I was fooling myself, latching on to the notion because I badly wished to believe there was some way to fix everything.
   1157272|00000000||However, matters have simply gone too far. I must come to terms with that.
   1197560|00000000||What…? But how?
   1208670|00000000||Why you rat schuurk!
   1207372|00000000||Borg, ducals in the house!
   1208606|00000000||Damn it, what's this?!
   1208608|00000000||I will find the arseritter!
   1208652|00000000||I know you're here…
   1208654|00000000||You will pay!
   1208650|00000000||Show yourself, you gutless rat!
   1207616|00000000||What is happening?!
   1202395|00000000||Borg, they're at the gate!
   1208552|00000000||How many?!
   1206289|00000000||They're too many! You cannot stop them!
   1206293|00000000||Quick, now!
   1206291|00000000||We will see! Light the barricade!
   1202405|00000000||There's one! Kill the schijtleister!
   1206295|00000000||And you! Run, summon Roderick's men!
   1208554|00000000||You two, with me - to the balconies!
   1207374|00000000||I will tear you to shreds!
   1207376|00000000||You will die, you little stronthe.
   1185327|00000000||Please, put me back! Yes, I'm a fraud, I lied to you, I've no notion where the cards are… but… but I shall think of something, just wait…
   1161381|00000000||Got it! A swordsmith - Trentin's the name. I skinned him at gwent once, but he had no coin so he promised me the pride of his collection - a lovely blade, finely fashioned. I passed on before I could get it, but you could collect it in my stead. Just tell him Louis de Corentin sent you.
   1096196|00000000||The dead Louis de Corentin?
   1111280|00000000||Hm, hm, that could indeed prove problematic… but if--
   1193020|00000000||I know! The man's a gambler, inveterate. His wife forced him to seek help - hypnosis or some such. She believes Trentin no longer touches cards, would wager her virtue on it. Were she to learn he still plays gwent, well, he'd be in a deep doodloo.
   1181108|00000000||Hm. Thanks.
   1135334|00000000||Ahhh, peace at last.
   1179791|00000000||I see you fell for that pious tart's drivel. Drats. Ah well, then listen, I've a request. Be a good fellow and set me in the chamber of the Gwent Friendship Society of Beauclair. It's just round the corner.
   1179795|00000000||You a member?
   1179797|00000000||That's just it, I was not. But I would have dearly liked to have been… and joining them in death shouldn't bother anyone.
   1179799|00000000||Certainly doesn't bother me. I'll do it. Where's this chamber?
   1179801|00000000||Ah, once you enter the catacombs, go straight. The chamber will be on your right, near the corridor's mouth. And I thank you.
   1106272|00000000||Beauclair is a city steeped in tradition, awash with wine and echoing with song. Though an unfortunate banishment had deprived its artistic scene of a certain bard's stimulating presence several years prior, at this time the town was still home to many talented composers, including a certain Adrien de Rouleau, whose career I had launched by giving him the nom de plume "Le Papillon." It was this rising literary star who one day asked Geralt for help finding a missing person: his hairdresser and close friend. Though this did not seem at first a job for a witcher, Geralt, for whom old habits die hard, decided to yet again help a poet in need.<br>
   1106273|00000000||Le Papillon's suspicions were well-founded: the hairdresser had indeed run into some serious trouble . An unsatisfied client, a knight named Beau Duvall, had taken him captive. Humiliated by a haircut which he felt did no justice to his inner beauty, Duvall wanted the hairdresser to pay a high price for his sloppy scissor work. Luckily Geralt arrived in the nick of time and despatched Duvall and his band to the next world. Thus the kidnappers were taught a lesson and the witcher earned the undying gratitude of hairdresser and poet alike.<br>
   1106274|00000000||Le Papillon's suspicions were well-founded: the hairdresser had indeed run into some serious trouble. An unsatisfied client, a knight named Beau Duvall, had taken him captive. Humiliated by a haircut which he felt did no justice to his inner beauty, Duvall wanted the hairdresser to pay a high price for his sloppy scissor work. Luckily Geralt arrived in the nick of time and challenged Duvall to a duel, which, I am pleased to reveal, the witcher won. In this way the knight was taught a lesson and the witcher earned the undying gratitude of hairdresser and poet alike.<br>
   1213343|00000000||The witcher's attention can be as hard to hold as a small child's. The grunt of a ghoul coming from a cemetery, a note hinting at a secret stash of witcher armor or, Lebioda forbid, the hem of some sorceress' garment is enough for him forget all about his present task to embark on a new one. In this particular case, he claimed the hunt for the Beast of Beauclair drew him away. This sounds altogether plausible, but the truth...  well, that shall never be known.
   1092928|00000000||Go with Le Papillon to the salon.
   1092929|00000000||Force open the doors to the hairdresser's salon using the Aard Sign.
   1092930|00000000||Use your Witcher Senses to look for clues about what happened to Jean-Louis.
   1093421|00000000||Follow the footprints.
   1093422|00000000||Defeat the knight and his men.
   1092932|00000000||Search the meadow using your Witcher Senses.
   1101341|00000000||Defeat Beau Duvall.
   1104585|00000000||Search the cave.
   1097864|00000000||Follow Le Papillon.
   1208421|00000000||Save the hairdresser.
   1093423|00000000||Kill the monster.
   1092931|00000000||Search your immediate area for a cave.
   1208463|00000000||Deal with the vampires attacking the city.
   1092927|00000000||Of Sheers and a Witcher I Sing
   1155517|00000000||The werewolf… did you kill it?
   1173584|00000000||Mhm.
   1173586|00000000||It murdered folk, devoured sheep, ravaged the farm… Oh, what a relief that's done with! I thank you!
   1173588|00000000||If you wish, I shall give you a trim. I just need a moment - my hands are still shaking!
   1155521|00000000||Need a shave.
   1173589|00000000||How'd you ever wind up here?
   1206898|00000000||What's a barber do on a farm like this?
   1173591|00000000||He shears sheep. Because sheep are calm, unlikely to scream at him if a lock is out of place or a color a touch off the desired shade…
   1173593|00000000||And here no one threatens to shorten you by a head if you trim a bit too much!
   1173595|00000000||Somebody threaten to do that to you?
   1173597|00000000||To me? Noooo. But… hm, well, one hears things!
   1177207|00000000||I found it impossible to work, under incessant pressure! When I saw the notice - "Urgent! Specialist sheep shearer sought!" - well, I didn't give it a second thought! And it was pleasant, at first… but then that werewolf appeared…
   1173599|00000000||Take care, now.
   1155522|00000000||Farewell.
   1155520|00000000||Like a new coiff.
   1155519|00000000||Witcher! Snip, snip. Need a trim?
   1196339|00000000||Hey there! Witcher! Come, we must speak.
   1195029|00000000||What wind blew you here?
   1195031|00000000||Deep water 'neath your keel!
   1195033|00000000||Arrrrrrgh.
   1195035|00000000||Who was that?!
   1195037|00000000||Why, you!
   1195039|00000000||Help.
   1195041|00000000||Put 'at away, grayhead.
   1194237|00000000||Triss?
   1194239|00000000||In the flesh.
   1194241|00000000||I… I thought you were in Kovir?
   1194243|00000000||I got tired of waiting for you, so I decided to head to Toussaint. Catch some sun, see how things are going. You said it would only take a moment…
   1194245|00000000||Things are pretty much wrapped up, luckily. We'll be able to head north soon.
   1194248|00000000||I hope you're not upset I came like this, without warning…
   1194250|00000000||True, I haven't always been fond of surprises. They remind me of work: the Law of Surprise, Surprise Child…
   1194252|00000000||But I think I've changed my mind. Seems surprises can actually be pleasant. Very pleasant.
   1194254|00000000||Let's go outside. There's this one cozy spot you're gonna love.
   1192553|00000000||Planning to do a bit of renovation. Paint the walls, replace the roof tiles, install tin gutters…
   1194078|00000000||Have you thought about the garden? Will you leave it as is, or change it?
   1192557|00000000||Hmm… maybe a hedge maze? With a statue in the center, one that's stately and… nude.
   1192571|00000000||Ugh, Geralt, don't bring up that ball… The wine got to my head and I…
   1192573|00000000||Not bringing it up to tease, but to reminisce. That evening… it was magic. And your dress… you looked lovely in it.
   1192575|00000000||I've got it with me… I could put it on one evening. We'll dine outside, by candlelight, listen to the music of the cicadas… Hm?
   1192577|00000000||Can't wait.
   1194094|00000000||There are already some new saplings and flowers around the grounds, but… I think it's still missing something.
   1192551|00000000||Just finished some remodeling. Paid through the nose for it, but I think it was worth it…
   1192526|00000000||So, how do you like my vineyard?
   1192528|00000000||Think you know the answer to that… I like it a lot. House is big, but not showy, lovely location… perfect for romantic getaways.
   1192457|00000000||What do you think about my vineyard?
   1192580|00000000||How'd you find me? Kovir's a long way off…
   1192582|00000000||I have my ways, Geralt. Hydromancy, for example.
   1192584|00000000||Oh yeah, that's right…
   1192586|00000000||So what becomes of us? See anything else in the reflection?
   1192588|00000000||Mhm. Zoltan moves in.
   1192590|00000000||Please, tell me you're joking.
   1192592|00000000||You can breathe easy. Far as I know, he's settled down in Novigrad and has no intention of budging.
   1192595|00000000||In all seriousness, though… I did see a few scraps of our future, but… I'd rather not tell you exactly what.
   1192597|00000000||Why not?
   1192599|00000000||Because you said you've grown to like pleasant surprises.
   1192456|00000000||How did you find me?
   1192530|00000000||This is your first time in Toussaint, right? Want me to show you around a bit?
   1192532|00000000||Sorry, but I've already made plans…
   1192534|00000000||Oh? What're you going to do?
   1192536|00000000||Lie down in the sun. And not move an inch.
   1192538|00000000||Ooh, right, a packed schedule… Not overdoing it a tad?
   1192540|00000000||Got to get the most of this weather before I return north… Know that joke about how to tell when summer's come to Kovir?
   1192542|00000000||The rain isn't quite so cold.
   1192544|00000000||And sadly, that's not far from the truth…
   1192547|00000000||Ehh, I shouldn't have told you that. Now you'll change your mind and not come join me.
   1192549|00000000||Wouldn't worry about that.
   1192462|00000000||Want me to show you around?
   1192464|00000000||Mind if I leave you here alone for a moment?
   1192466|00000000||Just a moment.
   1192419|00000000||I'll come back later.
   1192455|00000000||How are things in Kovir?
   1192608|00000000||How are things in Kovir?
   1192610|00000000||Amazingly boring and predictable. Council meetings mainly concern trade matters. Tariffs, storage regulations, that sort of thing.
   1192612|00000000||Missing the excitement?
   1192614|00000000||You know the Ofieri saying… "May you live in interesting times." Well, I've already done that and now am looking for a bit of quiet.
   1194235|00000000||The other mages I brought with me from Novigrad or who made it north on their own feel the same. You wouldn't recognize them - no conspiracies, cabals, plotting… They just sit there and work. For the good of the kingdom.
   1192617|00000000||Sometimes I think it's all too lovely to be true… That something's bound to happen, another war or some other horror.
   1192619|00000000||But for now… it's nice. And once you finish your business here and come join me, it'll be even better.
   1192461|00000000||Yes, Geralt…?
   1187105|00000000||Join me for a glass of wine.
   1195963|00000000||I haven't the coin.
   1195965|00000000||You don't need much, these days. It costs half what it did.
   1195967|00000000||Wine's cheaper? By what miracle?
   1195969|00000000||Matilda and Liam have made peace. They no longer waste time fighting, produce barrels of wine instead. Supply's up, so the price is down.
   1195971|00000000||I'll drink to that!
   1186091|00000000||The massacre at Dun Tynne - was that your cleaver at work, too, Butcher of Blaviken?
   1186093|00000000||Our dearest duquessa lies dead. Thanks to you, hero!
   1186087|00000000||A witcher. That can only mean trouble.
   1186089|00000000||He's no hero. That's the Butcher of Blaviken…
   1192982|00000000||A trader at market claims some foulness lurked in the cellars beneath Tufo. It made the whole vineyard shake!
   1192984|00000000||Have you heard? Loth Halfbreed attacked Fox Hollow! Folk say not a soul survived…
   1192980|00000000||One clever sot claimed to be a medic. He ordered all who came to see him - especially the maidens - to strip… nude!
   1186097|00000000||Help! Guards!
   1186101|00000000||I'm busy. Be off.
   1186095|00000000||Good day.
   1192986|00000000||Golly gee willikers…
   1192988|00000000||I heard about that.
   1186099|00000000||What a brute!
   1200712|00000000||You're pretty chatty, nosy…
   1165751|00000000||I would say inquisitive and sociable. Besides, a good tradesman ought to amuse his clients with small talk.
   1200714|00000000||Fair enough. Must know a lot about the folk of Beauclair.
   1200716|00000000||All about all, meaning everything about everyone. I know who slept with who, and who wishes they had. I know who's friends, and who'd slit each other's throats.
   1200718|00000000||Potentially dangerous, that kind of knowledge.
   1200720|00000000||Bah. But I'm known to keep my tongue tied, my mouth sealed tight. Why if I blabbed what I hear, they'd have done me in long past. As it is, all that's said on my stand, stays on my stand.
   1165746|00000000||Bet you hear a lot of gossip.
   1165756|00000000||Take care, now.
   1200736|00000000||Come early, come often. I'll perfect your look. And not only yours, but every man's, woman's, child's.
   1165754|00000000||Take care.
   1165708|00000000||Get many customers?
   1200702|00000000||Get many customers?
   1165749|00000000||Droves and loads!
   1200704|00000000||Though I expect to have more. My trade always booms when the tourneys are on.
   1200706|00000000||Knights' boots get dirtier then?
   1200708|00000000||It's not just the boots. When they fight, they soil all. I shine their armor, helmets, belts, sheathes… They like them shiny as a dog's danglers.
   1200710|00000000||Oh… pardon.
   1200726|00000000||Hey there.
   1191135|00000000||Greetings, guardian witcher. Thanks to you, my little enterprise is in ruddy health.
   1200728|00000000||Can't really see that anything's changed.
   1200730|00000000||All in due time. At the moment I'm perusing my options. Asking after prices, verifying quality. You know it's very easy to squander coin. But rest assured, I will spend mine very wisely.
   1200732|00000000||My, my… if you're like this now, who'll you be when you're older?
   1200734|00000000||A very rich man.
   1191122|00000000||Greetings, Sir Witcher. You've a generous heart. Surely you'll give custom - and perhaps spare a tip - to a poor lad working to support his sick mum?
   1200722|00000000||Last time I came by, your father was sick.
   1200724|00000000||For he was. But he got better. Now mum's taken ill, but she'll get better, too, once I've earned a bit of coin for her herbs.
   1165745|00000000||Heartfelt greetings, sir. Allow me to say you look wonderful, almost. Figure - trim… a stunning ensemble…
   1200690|00000000||But your feet… Those feet could stand to look better.
   1200692|00000000||As it happens, I'm a bootblack. Though the name's ill-fitting, for in truth I am a foot beautifier.
   1200694|00000000||And a smooth talker, that's clear.
   1200696|00000000||Could be, probably am. But in my trade, the clumsy-tongued go nowhere. Besides, I speak a lot, but every word's the truth. For example - I'm the most professional professional in all Toussaint. See?
   1200698|00000000||Sure, I see…
   1200700|00000000||I do hope you'll grace me with your custom. I need coppers in heaps to buy herbs for my sick father. He suffers terribly, the poor man.
   1181913|00000000||Well, well… Dandelion's always complaining about artists being poor as temple mice.
   1181915|00000000||The residence belongs to none of them. They are guests here.
   1181919|00000000||Orianna, she owns this. Woman in the black dress. There, on the balcony.
   1181921|00000000||Got her. Doesn't wear a mask?
   1181923|00000000||It would be pointless. All would know her anyway.
   1181925|00000000||Koviri orchid, let's look for it. If we find Cecilia, we'll find the Cintrian.
   1164478|00000000||We were really hoping to meet Cecilia Bellante.
   1164480|00000000||You are admirers, I surmise? I'm certain you will have ample opportunity to converse with her.
   1174943|00000000||It cannot be easy to identify anyone in this crowd. Perhaps you could help us find her?
   1174953|00000000||Hmm… I don't know where she is now, but I can give you a clue.
   1184020|00000000||Let's hear it.
   1184022|00000000||Seek the Koviri orchid.
   1184024|00000000||Meaning?
   1184026|00000000||Cecilia wears one in her hair. You shall recognize her easily by the orchid.
   1164379|00000000||Looking for Cecilia Bellante.
   1164380|00000000||What're these performances?
   1164382|00000000||Tell us about these performances?
   1164437|00000000||This evening The Mandragora has the honor to present three superb displays of artistry.
   1164439|00000000||The first was a concert by Cecilia Bellante, a singer whose voice, were it stone, would surely be a diamond. Sadly, Mademoiselle Cecilia has sung…
   1183885|00000000||A shame… we would have loved to hear her.
   1183942|00000000||Luckily, you are in time to see the Great Kalesti, a master of visual illusions come to us from far-off Ofier.
   1183944|00000000||Visual illusions, interesting… And the third artist?
   1183889|00000000||The third and fourth - for they are a duo - are the Tuven Brothers, presenting their newest pantomime.
   1186449|00000000||Right… right you are. We must proceed with caution. Come, it's our turn.
   1164318|00000000||Madame, monsieur, an extraordinary pleasure to welcome you to The Mandragora's soirée.
   1174915|00000000||Tonight I particularly recommend you direct your attention to the performances prepared by artists of our community…
   1185413|00000000||Especially since he might be expecting us…
   1185415|00000000||What do you mean?
   1186425|00000000||Ran into some of his thugs in town. Knew who I was, had it in for me.
   1184510|00000000||How do we find the Cintrian? Have you a plan?
   1184512|00000000||Key is not to spook him. Need to ask after his partner, Cecilia, first. Less likely to raise suspicions. Soon as we find her, we find him.
   1181907|00000000||Late… Now why's that not surprise me?
   1185176|00000000||Mhm…
   1185166|00000000||Oh, Geralt, Geralt… I knew I should have taken you to the palace, handed you over to my tailor. What ever are you wearing?
   1183986|00000000||Sorry, didn't have time to change…
   1183988|00000000||Luckily I prepared for just such an eventuality. Here, don this doublet. Its cut is all the rage these days.
   1211028|00000000||Oh, Geralt, Geralt… I should have ordered you escorted to the palace, handed over to my tailor… What is that you're wearing?
   1211030|00000000||Easy. Got something appropriate, just haven't had time to change.
   1211032|00000000||Hm… Very well. Let's see it.
   1211036|00000000||You like?
   1211034|00000000||You like?
   1185863|00000000||Well, well. A witcher in a robe… I last saw attire like this years ago, in Redania.
   1185865|00000000||Inappropriate for this evening? Not a good fit?
   1186444|00000000||It's a wonderful fit, but you're sure to stand out. No one wears such things around here.
   1185861|00000000||Well, well… I did not expect you to have such a sense of style.
   1185867|00000000||Let's go, soirée's started.
   1210384|00000000||Mhm… Wise of you to hide your weapons. They'd not have let us in otherwise, that's certain.
   1184040|00000000||Let's go inside.
   1184041|00000000||Why do they wear masks?
   1184055|00000000||Any idea why they wear masks?
   1184066|00000000||Likely because they imagine it is oh so very romantic and mysterious…
   1184068|00000000||The truth is far simpler - this way no one can tell which drunken aristocrats are pinching the performers.
   1183946|00000000||Not all bad… Nothing like a budding artist, of course, but…
   1183948|00000000||Just one other detail. Here, put it on.
   1183950|00000000||A mask…?
   1183952|00000000||All who attend a Mandragora soirée wear them. If you have one on, no one asks who you are.
   1210386|00000000||My, my, Geralt… Not bad at all. And you've even a mask… just not the kind required.
   1210388|00000000||Huh?
   1210390|00000000||They're a little different, the ones "Mandragora" members wear. I've brought you one. Put it on.
   1186813|00000000||Come in, come in… Our artists have truly outdone themselves this time.
   1186811|00000000||The Mandragora is honored to welcome you to another festive evening.
   1200455|00000000||Enter, a night of fantasy and wonder awaits.
   1200336|00000000||A pleasant evening to you.
   1106094|00000000||While strolling through Beauclair's charmingly romantic streets, Geralt learned of a circumstance thoroughly charmless and unromantic. Come night something was making much tastelessly grating noise at the city cemetery. <br>
   1106095|00000000||In the end the witcher brought the enduring marital dispute to a close, thus ending the nocturnal noise it entailed. He did so by transferring the urn containing Louis de Corentin's ashes to another crypt. Geralt could now look forward to the most pleasant stage of any contract - collecting his reward. This proved even more valuable than the witcher had initially supposed, for in addition to the payment he received from his employer, he also got a series of rare gwent cards from the grateful Margot de Corentin. How had the woman come into their possession? How else but by having concealed them from her gambling husband. Though naturally she had done this while they were both still alive.<br>
   1106096|00000000||In the end the witcher brought the enduring marital dispute to a close, thus ending the nocturnal noise it entailed. He did so by transferring the urn containing Margot de Corentin's ashes to another crypt. Geralt could now look forward to the most pleasant stage of any contract - collecting his reward. This proved even more valuable than the witcher had initially supposed, for in addition to the payment he received from his employer, he also got a splendid sword from Louis de Corentin. Though in point of fact he collected the blade not from Louis but from an armorer whom Louis had once handily defeated at cards. Though to Geralt it was all the same.<br>
   1184268|00000000||The witcher investigated and discovered that neither grave robbers nor necrophages were the source of the din. Rather, the ruckus was the work of a couple, the de Corentins. For as in life, so in death, they could not abide each other's company, causing much fear and confusion with their shrill disputes. Geralt concluded that separation was the sole sensible solution - he would have to remove one of their remains from the tomb they shared, transferring them elsewhere.<br>

Thus his adventure would have had a supremely happy ending, had he not allowed the armorer to talk him into a hand of gwent...<br>

   1204167|00000000||For four generations! That is how long my family has been producing wine.
   1204169|00000000||Producing plonk unfit to drink, you mean. Which is exactly why you should sell Belgaard to me, not him.
   1204171|00000000||Ahem, as a ducal clerk, I must look after the duchy's best interests. Belgaard currently belongs to the treasury.
   1204173|00000000||The minister of the treasury has clearly expressed his desire that Belgaard be handed over to a responsible steward. Yet diverse troubles beset both your present holdings. Until you resolve them and thus prove yourselves competent, selling Belgaard to either of you is out of the question.
   1204263|00000000||Know all about women, actually.
   1204269|00000000||Better - a connoisseur.
   1204271|00000000||Whoa-ho-ho, I see we speak the same tongue. So tell me, the swords - you merely wear them to intimidate, or do you actually use them?
   1204273|00000000||Tools of my trade. I'm a witcher.
   1204190|00000000||I simply cannot afford that much.
   1204192|00000000||Could you not reduce it a shave?
   1204188|00000000||If I'm in the area…
   1204290|00000000||Listen, might look in on you if I'm in the area. No promises, though.
   1204292|00000000||Naturally, I ask for nothing more.
   1204221|00000000||I'm sorry. That's not an amount I can afford.
   1204223|00000000||I sense we're close, very close…
   1204219|00000000||Can't promise anything.
   1204298|00000000||Mhh, dunno. Guess I can look around if I'm in the area. Rather not promise anything, though..
   1204300|00000000||I cannot force your hand, of course, but I do hope you'll not refuse a damsel in distress. If you decide to help, my vineyard lies westward.
   1204229|00000000||I shall stay here for a time - I must make certain Liam does not pull some stunt while my back is turned.
   1204231|00000000||Gotcha. Farewell.
   1204294|00000000||I can help. Least try.
   1204296|00000000||Wonderful! You've no idea how much that means to me. My vineyard lies due west.
   1204217|00000000||Yeah. I'll help you, too.
   1204218|00000000||Need to talk about my reward.
   1204225|00000000||Fine. Settled.
   1204227|00000000||Would you take advantage of my misfortune?! I did not think your help would come with dirty hooks attached…
   1204202|00000000||My vineyard lies east of here. You're sure to find it. Now forgive me, I must talk to that quill-pusher. I might win him over yet.
   1204205|00000000||Pssst! You're a witcher, yes? I heard you talking to that oafish ogre Liam. Disgusting man, the worst sort. First seduces with the dashing gaze, the fair face, then reveals a coal-black heart.
   1204207|00000000||But that's all beside the point. I stopped you because I want to buy Belgaard, too. Alas, things are rotten at my own vineyard, Vermentino.
   1204209|00000000||Hm. Strange coincidence…
   1204211|00000000||No coincidence - I am certain Liam's thrown a stick in my spokes. Several sticks.
   1204214|00000000||My cooper and blacksmith - both have mysteriously vanished. Man-eating plants have sprouted on my paths. And strange things are afoot on Pheasant Hill…
   1204216|00000000||Ahh, the list goes on, but the crux is one - I must solve my problems at Vermentino if I'm to stand any chance of acquiring Belgaard. Would you help me - before you help Liam? I'm willing to pay more than he's offered you.
   1204286|00000000||Sure sounds like work for a witcher. Yeah, I'll help.
   1204288|00000000||I am really, truly grateful. Thank you.
   1204186|00000000||Sure. I'll help.
   1204187|00000000||Don't work for free.
   1204198|00000000||Could look into it, but not for free.
   1204200|00000000||That goes without saying. What is your rate?
   1204194|00000000||That sounds fair.
   1204196|00000000||I am in dire need, but I shall not let you pick my pockets!
   1204275|00000000||Not seeking work, are you? You see, I wish to buy a vineyard - Belgaard. Yet that bloody bureaucrat's not likely to sell it to me until I settle my troubles at home, at Coronata.
   1204277|00000000||What kind of troubles we talking about?
   1204280|00000000||Ehh, it's botched, in more ways than one. The herbarium - infested with monsters. My steward - gone missing, with an entire transport of wine. And someone's abducted my herbalist…
   1204282|00000000||Lotta bad luck for one little vineyard.
   1204284|00000000||If you ask me, it's that… Matilda. Her handiwork. A sugar-sweet face, a temper sharp as horseradish. So, will you help?
   1204265|00000000||A witcher. So no expert, I guess, but it doesn't take an expert to see when a woman's angry.
   1204267|00000000||Heheh, I suppose you speak the truth, brother. Wait, did you say witcher?
   1204262|00000000||A witcher.
   1204176|00000000||Well? Happy? This is your fault!
   1204178|00000000||Mine? You're deranged, woman!
   1204180|00000000||Hark! Good folk! Be it known Matilda de Vermentino is a cursed, spiteful lunatic!
   1204183|00000000||Doesn't look cursed to me. Just really, really angry. Ticked her off quite a bit, you have…
   1204185|00000000||Truly? How would you know? A shrew-tamer, are you?
   1204257|00000000||I placed the first bid!
   1204259|00000000||But I made the best offer!
   1204261|00000000||Mademoiselle, monsieur, we must remain calm…
   1191524|00000000||Beg your pardon?
   1186149|00000000||Skeleton, bits of some old armor. Wonder who it was.
   1185750|00000000||Morholt? Where's your ma-- Dammit!
   1185435|00000000||A knight's plate armor and some bones. Gareth's remains? These them?
   1185437|00000000||Wonder why the armor came apart. Magic, or he just fall from a height?
   1200217|00000000||The world about you lives, endures.
   1200219|00000000||Light rushes in on the southern breeze.
   1162546|00000000||Look your last to the world's four winds.
   1163315|00000000||From the south, not a word.
   1104607|00000000||Hut looks inhabited… No sign of the dweller, though. Guess I'll look around.
   1162336|00000000||Should check on Jacob.
   1193782|00000000||Logger was making good time. Strange, though - willow's isolated, no other trees near it.
   1195169|00000000||Dammit… Got it wrong. Run!
   1162344|00000000||Gareth's remains. Witch must've tossed them in there.
   1162346|00000000||Must be Gareth's remains.
   1185853|00000000||Fresh blood and clear, deep prints.
   1192214|00000000||Looks like Jacob fled chased by… his dog.
   1193788|00000000||Swear I hear sobs in the rustling leaves.
   1153645|00000000||A hut. The witch's.
   1200223|00000000||On fall's eastern winds - summer's reprise.
   1163325|00000000||From the east, no cry is heard.
   1193780|00000000||Blood. Seeped from the direction of the tree judging by the shape of the stain.
   1193784|00000000||Piece of silk fabric, a bit of trimming. Hem of a dress, probably.
   1193786|00000000||Must be really old.
   1153643|00000000||Gotta get back to the tree, lift the curse.
   1104479|00000000||Actually does bleed. Looks like human blood, too. And the bark - resembles hypertrophic scars in places.
   1137072|00000000||Medallion's humming like crazy. Intense magic at work here.
   1119249|00000000||Dammit, where the hell's Jacob? Wouldn't abandon the tree of his own free will. Need to find him.
   1200221|00000000||Upon the north wind, winter's clouds roll in.
   1163327|00000000||From the north, silence sighs.
   1200225|00000000||Midst the winds of the west your name sings and spins.
   1200227|00000000||Daphne, rise, live again among men!
   1163329|00000000||From the west peer hollow eyes.
   1163331|00000000||Cease your vigil - dead he lies.
   1151161|00000000||Dammit… Witch wasn't lying when she said we'd never meet again.
   1200670|00000000||Not attacking. Doesn't mean it's not a threat, though.

   1093894|00000000||Help our brother, please. We'll make it worth your while!
   1187444|00000000||You need something?
   1187442|00000000||What? My work's growing cold.
   1200472|00000000||May a bolt of bleeding lightning blast those bums at Coronata!
   1187446|00000000||I've lots to do before it gets dark!
   1187448|00000000||I work from dawn to dusk's last light, then give my wife a good, long night!
   1202605|00000000||What… what is this?!
   1202607|00000000||He killed Hugo and Belen! Grab him!
   1206215|00000000||Botch it all, help! He'll kill us!
   1206213|00000000||We can't hold on our own! Help!
   1202610|00000000||Locked. Gotta find another way.
   1202602|00000000||Roderick sent them to get the horses. He's looking to flee. Can't let him.
   1168114|00000000||Kill him!

   1153619|00000000||Armor diagram… Incredibly complicated. Could find a craftsman in town skilled enough to decipher it, though.
   1193382|00000000||Hmm, and if I were to add jimsonweed in the last phase? Could be an intriguing blend, that.
   1188907|00000000||At last, a client worthy of the attire I sell.
   1195097|00000000||Why would you say that?
   1195099|00000000||My lady… have you not beheld yourself in a glass last? The figure, the waistline. There is not a dress that does not dream of being draped on such a body.
   1195101|00000000||Hm, well then, let's make some dreams come true.
   1174439|00000000||Time's short. Folk're dying.
   1176843|00000000||Orianna, I don't have time for that. Folk're dying and--
   1176845|00000000||And I'm about to mount my horse. So either ride with me, or finish this moving monologue alone.
   1193925|00000000||Dammit. Argh, fine.
   1189272|00000000||Where're we going?
   1174442|00000000||Not far. You see, I maintain a kind of… shelter, just outside Beauclair. An orphanage, to be precise.
   1174444|00000000||I've heard the birds whisper. They claim a terrible thing's happened there. Under the present circumstances, I must treat this seriously. I'm sure you understand…
   1176839|00000000||Mhm. Perfectly. Let's go.
   1193927|00000000||If I was talking to a human now, I'd say that every moment we delay brings another death. Thing is, doubt that moves you at all.
   1193929|00000000||Frankly, not in the least.
   1174438|00000000||Fine. Going with you.
   1150820|00000000||Need to, uh, see your Unseen, convince him to stop Dettlaff. Heard you could help me with that.
   1189264|00000000||My, my. It seems my dear Regis needs to be reprimanded. He's become rather… indiscreet.
   1150826|00000000||And you - there are simpler ways to commit suicide. A number of bridges you could jump off of, for instance.
   1150828|00000000||Just wanna talk to him.
   1151906|00000000||Hahaha…
   1151908|00000000||Talk… lovely. He'll rend your head from your neck, make shreds of you before you can open your mouth.
   1176804|00000000||Let me worry about that. Willing to do it or not?
   1176841|00000000||Hmm… I, too, would prefer a city calmed, but to reveal so dear a secret to a witcher…
   1193923|00000000||Know what? Come with me. I must tend to a certain matter. Then we'll talk.
   1174411|00000000||Need to talk to the Unseen Elder. It's urgent.
   1174413|00000000||Irritating…? That all you have to say?
   1189258|00000000||Bloodbath in the streets… that's "irritating"? I'd probably use a stronger term.
   1189262|00000000||Well, you know… I'm getting on in years. Not easily impressed. Takes a bit more to get me worked up.
   1174415|00000000||Yeah, suppose empathy's not something I associate with vampires.
   1176791|00000000||I suspected you would guess.
   1176793|00000000||Wasn't hard. Not like you tried hard to hide it.
   1176795|00000000||Should I have?
   1176797|00000000||Well, I am a witcher.
   1176799|00000000||And thus my foe?
   1176801|00000000||That depends entirely on you.
   1174406|00000000||In a hurry to get somewhere?
   1174408|00000000||Very much so. Now be kind enough to step aside.
   1176776|00000000||Chaos in the city. Know what's going on?
   1174410|00000000||Naturally. It's rather irritating.

   1207984|00000000||Though the investigation had already revealed almost all the key details of the mysterious murders – Geralt now knew their means, method and perpetrator and had even prevented their continuation – he still did not fully understand why this whole plot had been hatched in the first place. Yet he did not have to try hard to learn this last bit of information. Syanna did not hide it had been a simple matter of getting revenge on those who had forced her into exile. Vengeance is one of the oldest motives in the world, one which has brought many doom and few relief. As for Syanna, it brought her to a cell in the ducal palace.<br>
   1207985|00000000||Yet something continued to bother Geralt, a detail as minor yet difficult to dismiss as a pebble in one’s boot. Syanna had had a plan, an elaborate, precisely worked out plan… yet if so, what was its grand conclusion? By the time the witcher understood how the plan was to culminate, it was already too late. During a reconciliatory embrace, Syanna killed Anna Henrietta, the last of the people whom she blamed for her exile. Moments later she died as well, shot down by the captain of the ducal guard.<br>
   1207989|00000000||Though Syanna had shown she could be merciless with those she considered enemies, the witcher felt sorry for her, in a way. Perhaps because he had also been considered a freak his entire life, or perhaps because, though he never admitted it, he simply had a good heart. Whatever the cause, he decided to visit Syanna in her cell, where she revealed to him that her plan had one last, culminating step: the murder of Anna Henrietta.<br><br>Luckily, Geralt was able to get her to listen to reason and she decided to await her sentence patiently. She knew her sister well and could be confident Anarietta would not let any harm come to her.
   1207986|00000000||Geralt’s journey to the Land of a Thousand Fables bore more fruit than he had expected. His conversations with Syanna shed light on a few matters: she made no secret of the fact that her elaborate murder plot was about getting revenge on the people who had forced her into exile. Vengeance is one of the oldest motives in the world and has brought many doom and few relief. It was to bring Syanna face to face with a higher vampire who was simultaneously a serial killer, her slighted beau and, it seemed, a being still deeply in love with her…<br>
   1207987|00000000||When Geralt brought Syanna to the meeting with Dettlaff, he never expected this story would end with such a finale. Though several days had passed since their last meeting, Dettlaff had not managed to rein in the wrath he felt toward Syanna. He attacked her, and if not for the magic ribbon Syanna and Geralt had purchased in the Land of a Thousand Fables, he would have torn her to shreds in an instant. Yet the ribbon had been created to transport the ducal daughters to a safe place if they were ever threatened – and what place could be safer than the most protected part of the family palace? Syanna thus escaped Dettlaff’s claws and landed straight in the palace dungeons.<br>
   1207988|00000000||What could go wrong when an ancient vampire meets the woman who took advantage of his unconditional love to manipulate him into committing a string of murders? Sometimes I get the feeling Geralt did not bother to consider this question before taking Syanna to her meeting with Dettlaff. I suppose he must have counted on love overcoming the vampire’s hurt pride. If he’d have asked me, I would have told him it wasn’t a matter of pride at all. Dettlaff had simply realized the woman he had placed on a pedestal did not actually exist. In her place was a petty and malicious weaver of plots, whom he killed without a second thought.<br>
   1214315|00000000||Sylvia Anna… A lovely name, don’t you think? This beauty should come as no surprise, given it’s the name of the daughter of a duke and the sister of a duchess. Yet the fate Syanna (as her intimates called her) met was not as beautiful as might have been suspected for one so well-born – though, as it turns out, she had in truth been born rather inopportunely. She came into this world during an eclipse and thus fell victim to the panic surrounding the Curse of the Black Sun, which was said to affect young girls from ruling families birthed in similar circumstances. Though Geralt had serious doubts whether this curse truly existed, many claimed it caused horrible mutations which filled its victims with cruelty and a desire to kill.<br><br>Syanna’s parents certainly seemed to be among the believers in the curse, for they deemed her too dangerous to be allowed to remain at court and forced her into exile. Syanna then fled to Nazair and soon, for all intents and purposes, dropped off the face of the planet.<br>

   1191385|00000000||Hello, Geralt!
   1191422|00000000||What was that?
   1191424|00000000||M-mommy!
   1066749|c2b0ffc9||Degenerate
   1190256|00000000||Brave Sir Milton, you left us too soon. The sun on Toussaint shall no more shine, we shall no more delight in the taste of wine, and a dark curtain now obscures our moon.
   1198351|00000000||We sweat barrels of blood trying to disperse that Fourfingers' vandaguild… Then along comes a witcher, and with a huff and a puff, he blows the bumbotchers away!
   1198353|00000000||It was you who freed Fox Hollow? Yours is the honor and glory, witcher!
   1198355|00000000||The duquessa's death - a tragedy which will forever change the face of our fair land.
   1190252|00000000||Hey-yo! Hey-yo! A knight's life is full of woe!
   1190254|00000000||Just and true, the knight returned from his days at war, yet the lass for whom he'd pined and yearned had married days before.
   1190258|00000000||Ho, ho! Fortune shine upon you!
   1190260|00000000||Greetings!
   1207648|00000000||Now! All together!
   1190262|00000000||Now! All together!
   1190268|00000000||Treacherous cur!
   1190266|00000000||I'll show you, you rapscallion!
   1190270|00000000||Oh, harlotsbrood!
   1207638|00000000||Treacherous cur!
   1207642|00000000||Oh, harlotsbrood!

   1190264|00000000||One, two, one two - next to go to the grave is you!
   1190272|00000000||What's that supposed to mean?
   1190274|00000000||Hey there! Whoa!
   1207646|00000000||Quickly! From the right! Now!
   1190276|00000000||Quickly! From the right! Now!

   1191540|00000000||Good sir…
   1191548|00000000||Ugh…
   1191542|00000000||Scoundrel!
   1191544|00000000||Good folk, run!

   1195888|00000000||You were very near to it. It looked at you, then galloped into the woods.
   1158713|00000000||Trail of blood starts at the pillow, ends here. Medallion's still vibrating.
   1115930|00000000||Hmm. Seems there's at least some truth to the hermit's ravings.
   1115992|00000000||Something drinks the hermit's blood at night, that I know. Gotta talk to her. Maybe she can tell me something more.
   1158724|00000000||Shutters closed tight. Need to check the other side, see if the trail continues.
   1170529|00000000||Yeah… more blood here. Trail leads into the woods.

   1181218|00000000||Trim your sails, mate!
   1181224|00000000||Shame I wasn't around when the vampires romped about Beauclair… I'd have given them something to suck!
   1181226|00000000||How about that, witcher? Such a hero, yet they still would have put that gray noggin on the block!

   1186736|00000000||Have you not had enough? You've been in prison, were almost beheaded…
   1186732|00000000||Oh my, do I ever need to whizz…
   1186730|00000000||What's new, mon ami?
   1186738|00000000||Demon dingles… murderer!
   1197610|00000000||It cannot be!
   1197608|00000000||And you believe that?
   1197616|00000000||The witcher did not get that vineyard by killing monsters alone, you know…
   1197614|00000000||Do you know why Castel Ravello has good harvests, year in, year out? They import some alchemical dung from the empire, then fertilize their vines with it!
   1197612|00000000||The truth apparently is thus - when the witcher killed the silver basilisk, Count di Salvaress' blood boiled so hot, he burst a vessel and up and died!
   1186744|00000000||Mon ami?
   1186740|00000000||Well, hey there! Hullo!

   1173712|00000000||Customs in Toussaint differ markedly from those observed in the North. The fashions differ, folk drink wine instead of rye vodka, beer or mead, and the women are generally more amorous while men are more attentive to their own appearance (it is quite likely the two latter issues are linked). There is one custom, however, that remains unchanged both south and north of the Yaruga. Namely, faced by a monster problem, folk post a notice on a notice board, in which notice they promise to pay a reward, and then they pray a witcher happens by and reads it. The owner of the Tufo Vineyard did just as this custom ordains, and as it happened, Geralt was the one to find his note.<br>
   1173716|00000000||Thoroughly charmed by Toussaint's fairytale landscapes and vistas, Geralt devoted some time to crisscrossing the duchy without any specific destination or mission in mind. During one such escapade, he happened to wander by the Tufo Vineyard. During a brief and notably unpleasant exchange with the property's owner, he learned that some creature prowled the area, a creature that caused not significant land tremors.<br>
   1173717|00000000||Having learned the disturbing noises thought to be those of the Monster of Tufo were coming from the cellar, the witcher immediately ventured there. Geralt had barely arrived when, without any excess effort, he heard the scraping and crumbling of rocks beyond the cellar wall. Upon investigating the noise, he discovered a network of long, winding corridors stretching beneath the entire vineyard. In one chamber Geralt found a kikimore nest, but quickly concluded the beasts were not the cause of the trouble. The creature that had dug these tunnels was clearly much larger - and far more dangerous.<br>
   1173722|00000000||After speaking to the woman he had encountered on the estate, Geralt went to the spot where the farmhand Jean-Luc had last been seen. Following the man's trail, the witcher arrived at the entrance to a complex of caverns. There he established that the monster he was hunting could be none other than a shaelmaar.<br>
   1173723|00000000||Dirt is a shaelmaar's element. Underground the beasts feel very much at home. Thus they are exceptionally hard to track and corner there. The witcher concluded that instead of chasing the creature, he would lure it to the surface. He did just that, and then promptly dispatched the Monster of Tufo. It was said that the monster's roar when mortally wounded was heard far and wide, even off in the distance, at the Ducal Palace.<br>
   1175468|00000000||While investigating, Geralt had discovered not only the exact nature of the horrid creature termed the Monster of Tufo, but also the exact nature of Madame de Bourbeau's relations with the missing farmhand Jean-Luc. Conclusive evidence in this matter took the form of a silver pendant the witcher had found, containing a lock of the high-born lady's hair.<br>
   1173724|00000000||The last remaining thing left for Geralt to do was simultaneously the most pleasant part of the job. Namely, he could now collect his reward. Fortunately, despite his many flaws, Monsieur de Bourbeau nonetheless proved an upstanding man, paying the witcher his remuneration down to the last crown.<br>
   1196365|00000000||Geralt had only to complete the most pleasant part of the job - namely, to collect his reward. This proved to include a generous gratuity, Monsieur de Bourbeau's choice of means to thank the witcher for telling him of his wife's betrayal. Geralt provided proof of the infidelity - a silver pendant he had found on the body of the missing farmhand Jean-Luc. Said pendant contained a lock of the unfaithful noblewoman's hair. I cannot fathom why the witcher decided to meddle in a matter not his, something he customarily avoided doing. I can only guess that he might have been inspired by an inner surge of male solidarity.<br>
   1208534|00000000||The Tufo Vineyard was plagued by tremors caused by some unknown underground force. Yet these were no ordinary earthquakes, a phenomenon entirely unknown in Toussaint. The tremors caused noteworthy damage, as buildings collapsed, wine bottles fell from shelves and shattered, and wine barrels burst, releasing into the dirt their ever so valuable contents. The vineyard's owner suspected some subterranean beast was the culprit, and Geralt was inclined to admit he was right.<br>
   1150868|00000000||Contract: The Tufo Monster
   1197693|00000000||They say the vampires went wildest for virgin blood. So during the swarming, a great many had their corks popped. Just to be safe!
   1197695|00000000||Have you heard who won the tourney?! Geralt of Rivia! That witcher!
   1197691|00000000||One of the knights withdrew from the tourney. They say it was because of an itch he'd obtained at the Belles. Quite hard to scratch under metal cuisses, you know.
   1186838|00000000||Long live Her Grace! Three cheers for Toussaint!
   1186842|00000000||That is what I call a happy ending! Bravo, witcher!

   1209657|00000000||My grandmother hits harder than that!

   1209661|00000000||Nipping at my heels, wolfie?
   1209663|00000000||Very well. Time for a lesson in law and justice…
   1209665|00000000||Ooh, no, no, no! Put it away!
   1209667|00000000||Thrash him, boys!
   1209669|00000000||You! What the devil are you doing?!
   1209675|00000000||The duquessa's dead, a terrible tragedy… But order in the duchy must be maintained.

   1209685|00000000||How are things?
   1209683|00000000||Witcher?
   1153122|00000000||For a fairytale creature, that was one tough son of a wench…
   1153124|00000000||I told you this land had gone ape mad… Though I did not expect it to be so severe.
   1154726|00000000||Can't help thinking you might've done that on purpose.
   1154729|00000000||Why ever would I have?
   1154731|00000000||To get rid of your guard, your captor. Getting close to the exit at this point. Probably think you don't need me anymore.
   1154733|00000000||Well, you're wrong. You still stand to be quite useful to me.
   1155808|00000000||Let's just go.
   1155830|00000000||Think it might be time to get out of here.
   1167210|00000000||I couldn't agree more.
   1208626|00000000||Some other time, maybe.
   1208630|00000000||Another time, another place, maybe. No offense…
   1208632|00000000||None taken. You spoke clearly, you spoke honestly. It's fine.
   1153141|00000000||Come. The exit's this way.
   1155833|00000000||Ehh… I just hope this tale has a happy ending. For me, for you. For everyone.
   1155835|00000000||That may very well depend on you.
   1155837|00000000||What's that supposed to mean?
   1167212|00000000||Nothing beyond what you heard - for now.
   1155807|00000000||Hope this tale has a happy ending.
   1208672|00000000||Just gonna go our separate ways? No parting words?
   1154898|00000000||Did you wish to tell me something?
   1208674|00000000||Actually, that'd probably be best.
   1208676|00000000||Oh, my! No woman's ever treated you this way…
   1208678|00000000||Not that I recall, no.
   1208680|00000000||In that case, at last you've felt what so many women in this world feel at times.
   1208628|00000000||…
   1208625|00000000||[Let her have her way with you.]
   1208614|00000000||That so? How? Plan to use me like you did Dettlaff?
   1208616|00000000||No, I need you for a purpose far simpler.
   1208618|00000000||Well, don't just stand there and stare. I need a man, Geralt, and I'm not afraid to say it. I've no idea what awaits me once we leave this place. Treat it as my last wish.
   1208611|00000000||Useful? How?
   1208612|00000000||Supposed to get you out of here, so let's go.
   1208620|00000000||Yeah, I know. Gotta get you out of here. Come on.
   1208622|00000000||Wait. That's not what I meant. I need you for something far simpler, and far more pleasant…
   1208624|00000000||Well, don't just stand there and stare. I need a man, Geralt, and I'm not afraid to say it. I've no idea what awaits me once we leave this place. Treat it as my last wish.
   1162642|00000000||I don't like the look of that… Fall back!
   1153118|00000000||Here. We need but jump into the well. You first.
   1162680|00000000||Watch out, Geralt!
   1162682|00000000||It's about to strike!
   1180999|00000000||Aye, Marianne, close the account and pay the man his coin. Thank ye…
   1153294|00000000||Master witcher, yer coin. Just dinnae go makin' any more trouble, all right?
   1140104|00000000||This it? Expected a few thousand at least…
   1140115|00000000||There's things tae account for - taxes, inflation, and so on… Economy's nobody's fault, is it?
   1153906|00000000||Mhm, might've guessed.
   1180997|00000000||Ah, and master witcher, one more thing. Dinnae come to mah bank ever again. Can do without patrons like you.
   1171187|00000000||Don't you think you ought to train a bit before the tourney?
   1171191|00000000||Vivienne stands afflicted. We must learn what is wrong.
   1188987|00000000||Follow me. To the exit.
   1188989|00000000||Your things are past the first gate. Take them, leave them… I don't really give a fig.
   1207015|00000000||No safer place than a bank.
   1207017|00000000||Yes? Can I help ye?
   1207013|00000000||Leave. Immediately.
   1207011|00000000||Welcome to Cianfanelli Bank.
   1196644|00000000||Another nosy Nick, eh?
   1196642|00000000||No lollygaggers needed.
   1196640|00000000||You disrupt the Ducal Guard's work!
   1196638|00000000||You should not loiter here.
   1196131|00000000||Grrgle!
   1199529|00000000||Arrgghh…
   1193725|00000000||She… grrglle… she… grrg.
   1207812|00000000||Onward, witcher!
   1207814|00000000||Why do you wait?! Save them!
   1210164|00000000||Panthers. Travelers're in trouble. Gotta help.
   1176372|00000000||I wish to know your thoughts, Geralt. The Sangreal stain - how did it wind up on the paper? Is someone from the vineyard blackmailing the vampire?
   1157796|00000000||Could be a servant, could be the steward… Could be the wine was just stolen from the estate.
   1171001|00000000||We shall know when we arrive. It's not far now.
   1207995|00000000||Geralt, why do you flee?!
   1207997|00000000||Witcher, come back! You're to protect Her Highness!
   1170983|00000000||Panthers have attacked the wagon! We must help!
   1157786|00000000||Stay back, Your Grace! We shall see to this!
   1188791|00000000||Save the poor souls!
   1210166|00000000||Calm down. You're safe now.
   1174764|00000000||They were fortunate we happened by.
   1157820|00000000||This vampire… have you ever faced its sort before?
   1157822|00000000||I have.
   1157824|00000000||How did it end? Did you kill it?
   1168751|00000000||Didn't have to fight him. Hadn't killed anyone.
   1168753|00000000||Have you ever heard of anyone defeating such a vampire?
   1168755|00000000||Know of a man who defeated one, sure, but he didn't manage to kill it. Ultimately, only another vampire can kill a vampire.
   1209921|00000000||Done. Time to move on.
   1157790|00000000||Tell me more about this vineyard - Castel Ravello?
   1168695|00000000||It's the best in all Toussaint. An old master of the winemaking trade runs it - Fabricio.
   1157808|00000000||He trustworthy?
   1157810|00000000||He's held his post for years. There's never been a problem till now…
   1150401|00000000||My, what a smashing ensemble. You wear it well.
   1150403|00000000||Shut up. I look like a twit.
   1150406|00000000||The caftan is sewn of the best fabrics available and according to the best tailoring practices.
   1150408|00000000||But one must have a modicum of taste to appreciate this. Even the most exquisite robes cover only deficiencies in beauty - never in refinement.
   1158067|00000000||Used to wearing something different.
   1158077|00000000||Usually wear something different, better suited to my trade. Got nothing against this particular outfit, though.
   1158079|00000000||Just don't exactly feel comfortable in it. And I despise formal occasions.
   1158081|00000000||Hmph, nothing one can't get accustomed to. Now, be so kind as to stand still.
   1154993|00000000||All in all, why not check up on that? We'll go together - assuming we're done here?
   1159531|00000000||I am done, yes. It lies in your hands now - to see if you are able to present my handiwork at the ceremony with the dignity it is due.
   1166161|00000000||Or if you will first destroy it, crawling about the city's underbelly.
   1159535|00000000||Promise to be careful.
   1158720|00000000||You're right. Need to talk to the bootblack. Let's go.
   1154995|00000000||Could be worth checking with the bootblack again. Meet you by his stand.
   1150426|00000000||Fine. I shall await you there, shoot the breeze with the charming lad to pass the time.
   1166165|00000000||The bootblack? In the lower city? Intend to soil my masterpiece in the city's gutters?
   1166171|00000000||Promise to be careful.
   1158721|00000000||Not bad as ideas go, talking to the bootblack. Let's meet there.
   1158835|00000000||Wine vapors in the air must've gone to your head, Regis. It's over, Dettlaff's dead. Won't be any more murders.
   1158895|00000000||You're entitled to your opinion. I, however, will check this. Should you change your mind, you know where to find me.
   1158722|00000000||No point investigating any further.
   1185549|00000000||How do you know the bootblack delivered the letters?
   1185551|00000000||Regis, bootblack didn't say anything about making deliveries when we talked to him. How do you know he handled the letters?
   1185563|00000000||While you basked in glory and tried on new formal wear, I conducted a little investigation of my own. You'd be very proud to see how I conducted myself.
   1188850|00000000||I began by concocting an ample supply of boot wash for our enterprising young friend.
   1185565|00000000||I'd observed that among street folk, amidst their society as a whole, reciprocity takes precedence over all other codes and thus no good deed goes unrewarded.
   1185586|00000000||Of course, the same holds true for malicious or destructive deeds.
   1185567|00000000||The letters - what's the connection?
   1185587|00000000||When the bootblack arrived to collect his bucketful, he hinted he knew more. Simply put, we'd failed to ask the proper questions when we'd chatted earlier. It took a bit more tongue-loosening, but ultimately he spoke.
   1188852|00000000||He admitted he'd handed Dettlaff the letters. He knew this information was valuable to me. In providing it, he was simply repaying me.
   1158629|00000000||Hm, ceremonies, medals honoring virtues… Just keep coming up…
   1158641|00000000||I've had no reprieve, either. And I keep thinking of the last great virtue - compassion… It's the one piece of the puzzle that never seemed to fit.
   1158643|00000000||Mean you suddenly believe the Five Virtues theory? After all we've revealed?
   1158653|00000000||It's not a question of belief, superstition or old wives' tales. It's a conclusion derived through exercising pure logic.
   1158656|00000000||Syanna planned everything in advance. Had we not stopped her, surely there'd have been a fifth victim. One the gossips would have associated with a lack of compassion.
   1166157|00000000||Her plans don't matter now - can't act on them. Asked the messenger who delivered my invitation to the ceremony. Syanna's in the palace. Courtiers pressured the duchess to lock her in a tower.
   1158659|00000000||Do you care not a whit who else was in her black book? We've some time before the ceremony. We could still chat with that boot-cleaning urchin.
   1176076|00000000||He was the one to pass the victims' names to Dettlaff… Perhaps we missed something?
   1158194|00000000||Hm, reminds me.
   1158195|00000000||Can sense that philosophical mood coming on…
   1158197|00000000||Sound wistful, pensive, Regis. That because they refused to buy you a new outfit?
   1158199|00000000||Hardly. It's the tone I ever adopt when I find myself pondering. Which, believe it or not, happens quite a lot.
   1158201|00000000||Besides, I've no need for a new outfit as I shall not be attending the ceremony.
   1158203|00000000||Why not?
   1158205|00000000||Because unlike you, I don't have to. I shall begin to pack my belongings, instead. I trust you'll join me later, once you're richer by a medal and a fascinating new experience?
   1158821|00000000||Count on it.
   1158103|00000000||All that being as it may, Toussaint's highest honor, the Order of Vitis Vinifera, demands appropriate attire.
   1158105|00000000||The duchess cannot be expected to drape the medal on a suit of armor caked in mud. Palace protocol places enormous emphasis on form, virtuous tradition, etiquette…
   1158193|00000000||Hmph, a tradition which values appearances ahead of all else, which calls for lordly, glistening triviality and misplaced generosity…
   1158069|00000000||Rather not bicker about taste. Don't like to. It's neither interesting nor productive.
   1158071|00000000||This particular witcher has an inborn intolerance for formal occasions. Yet he's to attend just such an event shortly. I expect that's the source of his prickliness.
   1158073|00000000||So, try not to take things personally, master tailor. Rather pity him, for in truth stage fright overwhelms him. He trembles at the thought that he has no notion how to behave in the presence of Her Grace's majesty.
   1185548|00000000||Hmm. As well he should.
   1158020|00000000||Not about to debate taste.
   1202339|00000000||" I accept your allegiance and shall return in one year's time to…"
   1202342|00000000||Waaa…. Look! Look! The statues…!
   1202344|00000000||Impossible! Gods! Mother!
   1115249|00000000||A hero! The mane, the muscles!
   1115346|00000000||I find it's all a bit… much. And the background? Pure fantasy! Toussaint looks nothing like that!
   1115348|00000000||Forget about the background… You'd do better to study his musculature!
   1115250|00000000||Oh me, oh my! Now that's my kind of art!
   1115350|00000000||Moustacherois would have produced something better. And chosen a better vista as a background.
   1115352|00000000||Background!? Who cares?! Look at that exquisite body!
   1101061|00000000||Look at the posture! So proud and upstanding! And not a scrap of fat. Though the veins are a bit much.
   1101063|00000000||I cannot disagree. Quite well-built. Fine fetlocks, too. A noble horse.
   1101065|00000000||You and horses! I speak of the witcher! Oh, to wrap my arms around a man like that and… oooh!
   1115248|00000000||Ahh, to lie alongside that for a good long snuggle!
   1115335|00000000||Are you mad? And risk getting blood on you, or worse?! You should be careful with griffins, even dead ones!
   1115337|00000000||Who said anything about a griffin? I meant the witcher!
   1115247|00000000||Those muscles - oh, my!
   1115317|00000000||Incredible, aren't they? Quite the beast, that griffin.
   1115319|00000000||Griffin? I speak of the witcher! A well-built fellow - all over!
   1114928|00000000||A mighty beast!
   1115272|00000000||Meh. A war horse like any other.
   1115274|00000000||What do you mean, horse? I speak of the griffin!
   1178943|00000000||Come on, nancies!
   1178945|00000000||It'll be over soon.
   1178947|00000000||Wizard! Warlock!
   1178955|00000000||I love my job!
   1195157|00000000||We are Fourfingers' hanse!
   1195159|00000000||We are Starling Straggen's hanse!
   1195161|00000000||We are Loth Halfbreed's hanse!
   1178951|00000000||Brave you are, hayseed.
   1178953|00000000||Right once, left once…
   1178949|00000000||White-haired but witless…
   1178957|00000000||You killed him! You tallywhacker!
   1184813|00000000||Slithering snake by the lake!
   1184815|00000000||Do monsters have mamas and papas?
   1184811|00000000||Sir, have you ever met a vampire?
   1184819|00000000||Slithering snails by the baskets and pails! Teeheehee!
   1184817|00000000||What big swords you have!
   1201944|00000000||Aaagghhhrrr!
   1201946|00000000||Come to grandmama…
   1201948|00000000||*Slurp slurp* You look scrumptious today. *Slurp*
   1183801|00000000||Long live Our Gracious Ruler, Her Illustrious Highness, Anna Henrietta!
   1183799|00000000||I vow upon the heron that I shall never again touch a drop of Est Est red! Rosé, however, is another story.
   1183805|00000000||Whoa, hey there! How fare you?
   1183803|00000000||Hahaha! Hippity-ho, mate.
   1157088|00000000||Seems you did our work for us.
   1200536|00000000||If it was your job to exterminate them - yeah, I did.
   1200538|00000000||They were like an ulcer on Toussaint's derriere. Loth Halfbreed, the most cankerous of them all.
   1157098|00000000||Make armor to order?
   1200550|00000000||Of course. If I didn't what sort of craftsman would I be? Just tell me your needs, and I'll make sure to meet them in full.
   1157092|00000000||Craft something for me, can you?
   1157100|00000000||This Loth Halfbreed - part elf?
   1157102|00000000||You might have had a look before you tore out his innards.
   1201812|00000000||He was called Halfbreed, rumored to be a half-elf, but in truth? Who knows. Besides, how is one to know a half-elf? By one normal ear, one pointy? I've no notion.
   1200552|00000000||Probably right.
   1198877|00000000||You mean they really have two different ears?
   1198879|00000000||No. You really don't know a thing about them.
   1157093|00000000||Who was this Loth?
   1157104|00000000||So long.
   1157094|00000000||Farewell.
   1157091|00000000||Wanted to look at your wares.
   1157096|00000000||Mind if I have a look at your goods?
   1200548|00000000||Be my guest. I've top-notch armor. But as an expert, you'll see that for yourself.
   1157090|00000000||Welcome back, witcher.
   1201816|00000000||Hey! Witcher! Might you have a moment?
   1206141|00000000||You raised your hand against a vampire. You shall die for that!
   1206143|00000000||I did what I had to do.
   1186788|2e2cbb0f||King Cormorant
   1191281|00000000||Duvvelsheyss.
   1191279|00000000||Go on! I ain't, I ain't afeard!
   1165336|00000000||What say you we strip and… stomp some grapes?
   1165338|00000000||Would you squeeze my clusters?
   1193576|00000000||Wolfie, was it you who bit the Beast?
   1165334|00000000||I've a hole in my heart, can you mend it?
   1165332|00000000||Ohhhh myyyy…
   1171676|00000000||What exactly do you do here?
   1171674|00000000||Could you look to that spoon thief, do something, hmmm?
   1171678|00000000||More spoons missing…
   1171680|00000000||Diddlybuns, someone's stealing spoons…
   1211437|00000000||Barnabas-Basil Foulty, the majordomo of Corvo Bianco, was a gentleman’s gentlemen if there’s ever been one. His whole life he had served distinguished nobles - the Kniebihly family, for example, or Admiral Rompally, for another – for he would never tolerate an employer who detracted from his personal dignity. Since Barnabas-Basil remembered the times of Monsieur Bolius and Baron Rossell, he was a wellspring of anecdotes about the vineyard’s past. He knew every corner and every secret of Corvo Bianco. An excellent administrator, he offered a wealth of good advice concerning the modernization and management of the estate.<br><br>Geralt could not have hoped for better help. One could even say that, by entrusting Corvo Bianco to the hands of that marvelous majordomo, Anna Henrietta had given the witcher the most beautiful present he’d ever received, for a home without someone capable to care for it is no home at all.
   1211438|00000000||Barnabas-Basil Foulty
   1176211|00000000||I sell by the barrel only.

   1176213|00000000||Best offer around! Est Est, Erveluce and Pomino - lowest prices in the duchy!

   1190103|00000000||I need good vittles, rations, suited to a voyage at sea.
   1195091|00000000||You've come to the right place - none better in all Beauclair.
   1195093|00000000||You all say that, then I board my ship and next my gut's as twisted as a bride-to-be's braid.
   1195095|00000000||If you've no trust for my foodstuffs, be off. Perhaps you should try not eating at all. That's the sure way to drop weight and avoid dung storms.
   1185540|00000000||Men and dogs are not to be trusted.
   1185538|00000000||When dealing with men, speak softly and carry a large stick.
   1185544|00000000||Why do you stare at me so?
   1185542|00000000||Ehh, go gargle your bum!
   1191153|00000000||Well, well… What have we here?
   1199853|00000000||Witcher.
   1199855|00000000||Lady Vivienne?
   1199858|00000000||Counted on me getting lost.
   1199860|00000000||I did. I thought you no different from the knights. Good at tourneys, hopeless in the face of true danger. I was mistaken.
   1127726|00000000||So you're not actually a bruxa.
   1132310|00000000||A what?
   1132312|00000000||Suspicion I had - that you might be a vampire. Certain details seemed to confirm it. Then I changed my mind… Anyway, unimportant.
   1199901|00000000||Hear you come to this clearing often.
   1186804|00000000||This is where it all began… And as I was not able to evade you, save myself from you, then I want it done here. In this very spot. With no witnesses.
   1186806|00000000||Want what done?
   1160688|00000000||Why, you are a witcher. You were hired to kill me, were you not? Then do so, now. And do it quickly, I beg you. I shan't resist.
   1160690|00000000||Witchers only hunt monsters, and even then, not all. You're no monster.
   1160692|00000000||Then what am I to your eyes?
   1160734|00000000||Only thing I've figured out so far is you're no danger to anyone. Hope to learn more, though.
   1160695|00000000||Don't know yet.
   1160736|00000000||Most likely you've been cursed. Don't know who by or why yet, but hope to find that out soon.
   1160696|00000000||Afflicted by a curse.
   1160697|00000000||Can't you just tell me?
   1160738|00000000||Why should I guess, when you could tell me yourself.
   1160813|00000000||All depends what you say.
   1160823|00000000||Can't promise anything till I hear what you have to say. Decisions based on appearances - not a good idea. Regretted making those too often in the past.
   1160812|00000000||I swear on the heron.
   1160817|00000000||I will be discreet. I swear this on the heron.
   1160819|00000000||You mock me!
   1160821|00000000||No. It's just… you want reassurances, too many. If you want my help, you've gotta trust me. Won't peep a word to anyone, unless I decide someone needs to be let in on your secret.
   1180015|00000000||Let's. But are you gonna…?
   1197391|00000000||Ahh… yes. I cannot appear there all in feathers. Pardon me for a moment.
   1197395|00000000||You can change at will?
   1197397|00000000||No. But I discovered the water of this pool helps. Its effects are brief, but I can always be sure of them.
   1197399|00000000||Hmm. Interesting…
   1197401|00000000||Come.
   1180012|00000000||Let's.
   1180017|00000000||Think I'll stay here a little longer.
   1187191|00000000||As you wish. Then I shall see you on the morrow.
   1180013|00000000||Think I'll stay here.
   1207045|00000000||All right. There's another. Ancient ritual, we'd need an oriole egg. Should release the curse's grip permanently. Gotta warn you, though - could have serious consequences.
   1207047|00000000||Consequences? What kind?
   1207049|00000000||Curse was cast before you came into this world. Ritual'd involve transferring it to an as yet unhatched chick. You'd be free.
   1207051|00000000||Thing is, you could be left with the average life span of an oriole.
   1207053|00000000||Seven years…
   1207055|00000000||I understand. Alas, every rose has its thorn, and there are no happy endings. Yet truth be told, I never thought I would get one. I came here prepared to die.
   1207057|00000000||Yet you wish to give me seven years of life, real life, free life? This is no dilemma. I agree. Wholeheartedly.
   1207059|00000000||I see why. I understand. Don't have to decide just yet. Think it through.
   1207061|00000000||I will. They must miss me at the tourney grounds by now. Shall we? Return?
   1207042|00000000||There is another method.
   1207043|00000000||You're quick to reject help.
   1207065|00000000||Pretty quick to reject help. Why is that? The curse once transferred would probably have a weaker hold on the new host, lots weaker.
   1207067|00000000||I do not even wish to hear of it.
   1186981|00000000||The curse - it could be reversible. Once ran into a baron transformed into a cormorant, ostensibly for good. Managed to cure him completely.
   1186994|00000000||And you truly think you could do something like this for me?
   1187007|00000000||Can't guarantee a thing. Tough case, yours. You were cursed before birth - that alone complicates things. Also, you claim the curse is increasing its hold, symptoms are progressing.
   1207063|00000000||Could try transferring the curse onto someone else.
   1207030|00000000||What? Out of the question! I shall not allow it to ruin an innocent's life! Is this the only method you know?
   1207032|00000000||Only one that’s completely safe.
   1188108|00000000||So there is another?
   1186978|00000000||I can try to lift the curse.
   1186979|00000000||Magic illusions - using them can be dangerous.
   1187097|00000000||Ointment you use includes a potent magic ingredient. You don't have the immunity mages have. Use heavy doses, or normal doses too long, and it could be dangerous to you.
   1187099|00000000||I sensed this… The very reason I knew I would have to give it up in the end, and bid my human form a final farewell.
   1186954|00000000||What happened after that?
   1186965|00000000||Nothing, at first. I came into the world a perfectly normal child, and my parents forgot that day's events. But fifteen summers into my life, the curse began to show. Initially, only when the moon was full.
   1186967|00000000||But now it's advanced so that even in daytime I must use magic ointment to mask its symptoms, to look normal. Thus, I thought someone had discovered my secret, then hired you to kill me.
   1186975|00000000||In fact, I was resigned to death in coming here. Perhaps death would be preferable to my complete and permanent transformation. For I fear that is what lies in store.
   1160834|00000000||What happened then?
   1160835|00000000||What'd the creature look like?
   1160837|00000000||Parents ever describe the creature?
   1160839|00000000||They called it a nymph born of the deep woods, with no mother or father. But I was too young, too distraught by the curse's onset, to ask after details.
   1160825|00000000||Ah, so be it. I shall tell you what my mama once told me.
   1160827|00000000||When she was with child, expecting me, she and my father spent much time together near the wood. Here, in this clearing.
   1160829|00000000||Mama loved to listen to the orioles sing. She would stroke her belly and say, "My daughter should be as beautiful as that bird. Such is my wish."
   1160831|00000000||But a creature dwelt in the wood who envied my parents their happiness. One day it appeared before them to say the whole wood belonged to it, and they had dared to delight in something that was not theirs.
   1160833|00000000||It demanded payment, and when my parents said they had nothing, it claimed their unborn daughter as its own.
   1160815|00000000||You got nothing to fear. Came here to help you. And I won't peep a word to anyone, unless I decide it's absolutely necessary.
   1160811|00000000||Got nothing to fear.
   1160740|00000000||If you've no contract on my life, why take an interest at all? Did Guillaume put you up to it? Is that why?
   1160742|00000000||He wanted to help you, asked me to do him a favor. Frankly, if I can do something for you, I'll do it, willingly.
   1160806|00000000||Why should I trust you?
   1160808|00000000||Cause the duchess trusts me, 'cause I'm a freak, too, 'cause cases like yours are my bread and butter… Take your pick.
   1160810|00000000||You shall not turn on me, use what I say against me? You shall not tell anyone?
   1112290|00000000||Please disperse! The exhibition is closed!
   1098627|00000000||What's this about?
   1098629|00000000||Oh Lebioda, give me strength! I can't bear this! I believe I've been clear - no presentation today!
   1112305|00000000||Wait… are you not that famous witcher, Geralt of Rivia?! I believe I have work for you!
   1104754|00000000||Saw your notice. Mentioned a monument?
   1112309|00000000||What kind of work?
   1112764|00000000||Work related to the monument to Reginald d'Aubry…
   1112762|00000000||The matter is a delicate one, but mind you, I pay well… Alas, I can say no more at this stage. Interested?
   1098632|00000000||Don't have the time.
   1098645|00000000||Don't have time for this just now.
   1098647|00000000||I understand perfectly. Time is coin, after all. But… find some time for me and I shall find some coin for you! Think it over.
   1098631|00000000||What's this about? Just tell me.
   1098638|00000000||The statue - just tell me what's the problem.
   1098640|00000000||A picture's worth a thousand words! More, I daresay! Come with me. I'll show you.
   1098636|00000000||Witcher! Decided yet? Will you see to our monument's, uh, little problem?
   1015555|0001853c||Dog
   1167572|00000000||In the palace pantry!
   1167576|00000000||Mice and cheese… Palace pantry, maybe?
   1201715|00000000||No, the Hare is obliged to hide here in the gardens.
   1201707|00000000||Got no idea where Milton's hiding!
   1201709|00000000||Too cryptic, this riddle. Got no idea what it's talking about.
   1201711|00000000||Then be silent and let me think.
   1201718|00000000||Someplace cramped!
   1201720|00000000||Is it about someplace really cramped, uncomfortable?
   1201722|00000000||Because it mentions groans and a mouse? No, false hints, I think, meant to lead us astray.
   1167570|00000000||It's a greenhouse!
   1167578|00000000||Let's see. "Groan" with e's gives us "green," right? And "mouse" with the head of "hard cheese"…?
   1201698|00000000||Green-house?
   1167582|00000000||You're a genius! Several greenhouses in the gardens, indeed! But only one with a door that locks! The key to which looks just like the one we found!
   1161614|00000000||Greenhouse it is, then. Let's go!
   1161620|00000000||Look - if we take "groan," hollow it out and fill it with e's - the letters, that is - we get "green." Then "mouse" - but starting with what heads "hard cheese"? Why, it's "Greenhouse"!
   1161622|00000000||Hm, pretty clever. And it sounds right to me.
   1167569|00000000||There are several greenhouses in the gardens, but only one with a door that locks. And the key to it looks just like the one we found!
   1167574|00000000||Groans, hollows… Could be a cave, I guess.
   1201713|00000000||Now that's just silly.
   1167571|00000000||In a cave!
   1161607|00000000||Got a key and a clue!
   1161609|00000000||And I've another! Show me yours!
   1201732|00000000||Who wrote this drivel?!
   1167567|00000000||"I begin like a groan hollowed out with ease, then end like a mouse with a head of hard cheese."
   1187647|00000000||If you please, Your Grace…
   1187649|00000000||We do not please. We act out of the highest necessity. All shall be explained later.
   1187651|00000000||But it's against the rules…
   1187653|00000000||I am the rules!
   1187655|00000000||Geralt! At last!
   1187694|00000000||Your Grace! We did not expect--
   1187696|00000000||My dear subjects! Lend me your ears! Now!
   1187698|00000000||You must all spread out and penetrate the area! And bring me the phoenix egg!
   1187700|00000000||But Your Grace…!
   1187702|00000000||I ask you nicely! Hop hop! Do this for me! The time to explain will come later!
   1187637|00000000||But Your Grace…
   1187639|00000000||No buts.
   1187641|00000000||I wish only…
   1187643|00000000||Forgive my wife, Your Grace. She wished to win so badly.
   1208523|b3a53f6d||Apparition
   1055244|b45443e2||Wealthy Townswoman
   1196275|00000000||Good day.
   1196277|00000000||Greetings.
   1196279|00000000||Oh you…!
   1196281|00000000||Save yourselves!
   1208497|8e3cceeb||Iocaste
   1150492|00000000||Diamond saw blade. Perpetrator's tool.
   1150494|00000000||Dried blood stain.
   1099046|00000000||Piece of coat fabric caught on the nail. *Sniff* Heavy on cologne. Smell oughta lead me to the thief.
   1134690|00000000||Can't believe I'm actually doing this…
   1099044|00000000||Saw marks're straight and clean. Precision castration, I'd call this.
   1201585|00000000||Scent leads to this door.
   1191522|00000000||Wha? Wha? What is it?
   1195786|00000000||Ptooey!
   1195788|00000000||A warlock.
   1195790|00000000||Blooood!
   1124996|ffd5fe1c||Fisher King
   1209977|00000000||Toussaint - the land of love and wine!
   1209979|00000000||Exactly how I remembered it.
   1207866|00000000||You will find Beauclair has changed some these past years.
   1207868|00000000||Walk about when you have the chance. You will see for yourself.
   1207870|00000000||To me, place always seemed straight out of a fairy tale. Knights-errant, elven palaces…
   1207872|00000000||Do you insinuate that we are somehow odd? I shall prove you wrong! This I pledge on the heron!
   1192757|00000000||Junk that came down the river.
   1192759|00000000||We must keep searching.
   1192679|00000000||Silk kerchief, monogrammed d.l.C. A noble's accessory, clearly.
   1196818|00000000||A watering hole for traders, smugglers, boatmen. But you will find no better crayfish chowder in all Toussaint.
   1192696|00000000||Drawn here by the smell of blood. Let's keep looking.
   1192955|00000000||Got guests! Careful!
   1195902|00000000||Nets were attached here.
   1199840|00000000||The trail ends. What now?
   1199842|00000000||Now we go wading.
   1199848|00000000||Pulled the body out of the water here. Must've floated downstream, got caught in the nets.
   1199850|00000000||I'll dive in, see if the guardsmen missed anything.
   1199866|00000000||Blood traces on the bottom. And a boathook.
   1199868|00000000||Body pulled from the river was transported using this boat.
   1199862|00000000||Wheel ruts. Guardsmen must've transferred the body from the boat onto a cart or wagon.
   1199864|00000000||Trail's muddled from here. Got nothing we can follow.
   1205593|00000000||Need to comb the bank.
   1204132|00000000||Be nice to know where they took the corpse.
   1205591|00000000||Hobnailed boots, multiple sets of prints. Ducal Guard, clearly - let's see where they went.
   1205575|00000000||Footprints, see them? And a rut made by the hull of a boat. Left recently, I'd say.
   1205579|00000000||Look at the rut - guardsmen left this site by boat, recently.
   1205581|00000000||Probably to transport the body somewhere.
   1205595|00000000||Walked along the shoreline.
   1205611|00000000||Perhaps the body lay on the bank.
   1209220|00000000||Mhm. Gonna dive in, check the other nets.
   1205585|00000000||Dragged some nets onto the bank, then cut them to untangle them. Lot of blood, so the corpse must've been cut up, quartered, maybe.
   1205587|00000000||It's likely they loaded the body parts onto a boat and sailed off.
   1205603|00000000||Blood… Guardsmen pulled these nets out of the water, then cut the mutilated body free.
   1209218|00000000||Gonna dive in. Make sure they didn't miss anything.
   1202428|00000000||I find it hard to discern anything in this muck.
   1199844|00000000||Here, look.
   1199846|00000000||Indeed.
   1199910|00000000||Only blood-soaked scraps left of the victim's clothing. Good quality cloth.
   1199912|00000000||A wealthy victim, correct?
   1200326|00000000||Looks it.
   1192761|00000000||Junk, junk and more junk.
   1192753|00000000||Anything taken by the current ends up in these shallows.
   1192755|00000000||Yes. The stench is fierce.
   1208958|00000000||Ugh…
   1111587|00000000||Oop. Sorry to interrupt, I guess…
   1113126|00000000||This… this is not what it seems! Word of honor, I… I tripped, rolled, tumbled, then landed where she already lay!
   1114713|00000000||Psst! Hughes, that's not him!
   1148090|00000000||I… I swear, this is all an unfortunate coincidence, a series thereof-- What?
   1148092|00000000||That's not my husband!
   1113128|00000000||You mean…? Not… not your husband?
   1170456|00000000||Who are you and why are you in my home? Out! Now, or I'll summon the guards!
   1111631|00000000||Calm down. Just here to talk.
   1111625|00000000||Just wanna talk.
   1111624|00000000||Don't like your tone.
   1111627|00000000||Watch your tone, gramps. Just here to talk.
   1151212|00000000||I… I believe we have nothing to talk about.
   1114651|00000000||Oh, we do, we do… Just to kick things off - you're in great form for a man your age.
   1114653|00000000||Ahem… I eat well, start the day with a glass of wine - that preserves a body wonderfully…
   1114655|00000000||Interesting, might try it. Say, ever heard of Reginald d'Aubry, his statue?
   1114657|00000000||Pff. Everyone in the city's heard of it. Reginald's a paragon, a national hero.
   1149565|00000000||That so…? You seem well-informed, Hughes. Maybe you know who stole Reginald's testicles?
   1149559|00000000||A hero, you say…
   1149558|00000000||Stop. I'm no idiot.
   1149561|00000000||Cut the bullshit, Hughes. You stole Reginald's testicles. Know that already.
   1149567|00000000||I… I can explain everything… This…
   1149866|00000000||Rosalinda! I know you're in there! You and that fancy pants of yours!
   1150318|00000000||Oh, no. Not him, too. This really is not my day…
   1150320|00000000||Got you, you rogue! Prepare for a shellacking, scally-- What the love's this?!
   1151244|00000000||Rosalinda! One I could forgive you… but two at one time?!
   1151246|00000000||Wait. Got nothing to do with this.
   1151248|00000000||Hah! Take me for a fool?! I'll teach you to fish in another man's pond!
   1104711|00000000||You heard me. Calm down or you'll wind up picking your teeth up off the floor.
   1135274|00000000||Tough, are you?! Come here! Come on, you scamp!
   1104708|00000000||Not gonna repeat myself.
   1104709|00000000||Go home.
   1104713|00000000||Ahh, got no time for this… Go home.
   1149864|00000000||Y… yes. That'll be best. I… I'm done here.
   1104725|00000000||Hm. Guess I could say I never found Reginald's stones… But you'd have to be careful, make sure no one figured out you had them.
   1104727|00000000||I shall be the epitome of discretion, on my honor! So, we've a deal?
   1106242|00000000||Fine. Keep 'em.
   1170650|00000000||You're priceless! Here, take this coin…
   1170652|00000000||I haven't any more at this moment, but do come back in a week's time. I'll have scraped together twice this amount.
   1170654|00000000||Sounds good. See you in a week.
   1121888|00000000||Fine.
   1099519|00000000||I'm back.
   1113513|00000000||Sh-sh-shhh! Not so loud! You'll wake her! She'll want another go!
   1164859|00000000||Wake who? Rosalinda?
   1164861|00000000||Louisa, her cousin. She's… she's voracious, got an inexhaustible appetite, but I'm tapped out.
   1170581|00000000||What's it matter that the spirit is willing, when the flesh is simply spent…? My heart near leapt out of my chest last time.
   1170583|00000000||Here, you must take the testes. And Lebioda grant you strength, as I daresay you will need it.
   1152083|00000000||No chance. Need to take the stones, pure and simple.
   1170696|00000000||But… but if you were to leave them with me, for a day or two… three at the most!
   1151591|00000000||Shit out of luck. Sorry.
   1152085|00000000||At the day's end… it's good I had a chance to use them at all. Here, take them.
   1170700|00000000||Thanks. And good luck. Actually think you'll do just fine without them.
   1099483|00000000||Nope. Need to take 'em.
   1104721|00000000||Perhaps, I… I could lend them to you. For one more day. What would you say to that?
   1104723|00000000||A day is three more romps at the least. You've a deal, sir!
   1099484|00000000||Willing to lend them to you.
   1170539|00000000||I don't know you, but that would have gone horribly for me had you not intervened. I thank you for saving my skin.
   1170541|00000000||Mhmm… So, time to talk.
   1170544|00000000||Ah. Rosalinda, my dove, please allow us a moment.
   1170547|00000000||All right, I admit I stole the stones.
   1170549|00000000||And you will never believe it, but… they work! Today, Rosalinda and I… well, three times and counting!
   1170551|00000000||Three times…? Impressive.
   1170553|00000000||Isn't it? At my age?! That's more than the entire last decade!
   1171342|00000000||All the same, you stole those stones and you gotta return them.
   1170555|00000000||Listen, perhaps we might strike a deal? Hm?
   1170557|00000000||Let me keep the stones. I'll pay you. Grant me this, I beg you. They… they've made me young again!
   1145516|00000000||Ugh… Thank you for nothing. You certainly look the fighter, but that's all…
   1099495|00000000||Well, I suppose I must admit it… I stole the stones, but it matters little now… All is lost.
   1104715|00000000||What do you mean, lost?
   1113248|00000000||While you were out, Rosalinda's husband came after me… Smashed Reginald's testicles to shards and dust, I'm afraid. They're of no use to anyone, now.
   1113284|00000000||Your work here is done. Now leave me be.
   1187436|00000000||Hah! Dangly dipsticks and mangy muffs!
   1187434|00000000||My navel… blimey, it itches!
   1198903|00000000||Now that's lovely - Liam and Matilda embracing! What a story!
   1187438|00000000||Women and chops - the more you beat them, the better they are!
   1187440|00000000||Monsters are your catnip - ladies mine!
   1173352|00000000||On the lakeshore Geralt encountered a hermit who promised the witcher a wondrous blade. To receive it, Geralt had to prove he lived by the five chivalric virtues.<br>
   1173353|00000000||Step by step, in trial after trial, Geralt demonstrated that he was indeed in possession of the Five Chivalric Virtues. It was an achievement, this cannot be denied, for many before him had tried to do the same, yet had failed.<br>
   1173354|00000000||The test culminated with a last, secret trial. Geralt had to defeat a hermit in a contest that took place upon the lake's surface. Soon after, to his great surprise, the old man proved to be none other than the Lady of the Lake in disguise. Geralt had encountered the Lady on his Path, though quite some time past. In gratitude for fulfilling her demands, the Lady once more bestowed upon Geralt the legendary blade called Aerondight. <br>
   1175926|00000000||While traversing Toussaint, Geralt encountered a hermit who brazenly challenged him to a duel. As you might suspect, there was more to the matter than the old man's sudden compunction to brawl.<br>
   1176582|00000000||After a fierce and beautiful fight, Geralt defeated the hermit. The witcher was then greatly surprised to learn the man was in fact the Lady of the Lake in disguise, a woman Geralt had encountered long past on his Path. As the hermit had promised, the Lady bestowed upon Geralt the legendary sword called Aerondight. <br>
   1199548|00000000||Witchers are not knights and do not share their priorities. This is probably why Geralt failed to prove he was in possession of the Five Chivalric Virtues. The mystery of the hermit's true identity remained unresolved.<br>
   1205884|00000000||Geralt overheard a conversation between two knights. One of them had recently undergone a mysterious trial. This had played out on the shores of Lac Célavy.<br>
   1208543|00000000||Though Geralt reached the isle upon Lac Célavy, he found no one there. Most likely he had waited too long to investigate the matter, and after all, we well know Destiny does not like to wait…<br>
   1209949|00000000||Many consider themselves courageous, yet when confronting true danger prove consummate cowards. Naturally, this applies in no way to Geralt, who faced mortal danger and vanquished it post haste, thus successfully passing the Trial of Valor.<br>
   1209950|00000000||At times it is hard to keep one's word and thus demonstrate honor when faced by temptation. Luckily, Geralt was stouthearted and successfully completed the Trial of Honor.<br>
   1209951|00000000||Mercy is not something folk expect of witchers. As it is, they were created to hunt and kill monsters, and the mutations they undergo as children customarily strip them of all emotions. Yet Geralt had always been somewhat different, so when push came to shove he passed the Trial of Compassion, for he had always striven simply to be a decent man in spite of all.<br>
   1209953|00000000||Paradoxically, it is sometimes easier to demonstrate valor or honor than it is to show generosity. For the fact is many are courageous and honorable simply to advance their own cause. Geralt, like all witchers, worked for coin, but always knew well when a situation required him to show generosity. No surprise, then, that he successfully passed the trial meant to test this virtue.<br>
   1209955|00000000||Among the virtues, wisdom is arguably hardest to prove, for many consider themselves wise, yet the world is full of fools. Geralt never thought of himself as excessively wise, and perhaps this is why he managed to prove this virtue was no stranger to him.<br>
   1209956|00000000||Upon a notice board in Toussaint, Geralt found a call to all who wished to submit to a Test of Virtue. The notice's mysterious author summoned any who dared to an isle upon Lac Célavy, where they would have a chance to prove their worthiness of character. He who successfully completed the test would receive a reward. Though Geralt had never thought of himself as particularly virtuous, he found the summons intriguing and decided to go to the appointed spot to learn what the trials entailed.<br>
   1135373|00000000||Return to the hermit and have him judge your deeds.
   1147697|00000000||Wait for a chance to prove your valor.
   1147698|00000000||Wait for a chance to prove you are a man of honor.
   1147699|00000000||Wait for a chance to prove you are capable of compassion.
   1147700|00000000||Wait for a chance to prove your generosity.
   1147701|00000000||Fight the hermit.
   1147822|00000000||Tell the hermit you're ready to fight him.
   1147938|00000000||Wait for a chance to prove your wisdom.
   1205885|00000000||Investigate the isle on Lac Célavy.
   1208556|00000000||Talk to the hermit.
   1107109|00000000||[Optional] Read the inscriptions on the stones.
   1107108|00000000||There Can Be Only One
   1186137|00000000||Wha'th that?
   1186135|00000000||Ouch! My toof…
   1186141|00000000||I mutht go thee a medic about thith toof…
   1186139|00000000||My toof, fum fiddly!
   1165853|00000000||Killed all these men to get to the body.
   1193941|00000000||What was she doing at the table, though?
   1182281|00000000||You - saw you at the inn.
   1172302|00000000||We don't have to fight.
   1193935|00000000||You are wrong.
   1199914|00000000||I cannot let you leave.
   1187286|00000000||I know what you are. Don't know why you killed these people, though. Clearly wasn't for their blood.
   1187288|00000000||Why'd you kill these people? Clearly wasn't for their blood.
   1195792|00000000||Going somewhere, friend?
   1195794|00000000||Oh, no.
   1195796|00000000||Muuurdeeeer!
   1195802|00000000||I'll be damned!
   1211295|00000000||We're to storm Dun Tynne.
   1211301|00000000||Expect armed resistance. The strength of the fortifications remains unknown.
   1211303|00000000||Your foes have committed treason. You fight them for the good of the duchy!
   1211305|00000000||Captain de la Tour will give you the details.
   1163370|00000000||My guess? You're a filthy filcher.
   1163368|00000000||Good day. Now on your way.
   1163372|00000000||May your brows fuse!
   1163374|00000000||What now, eh?! What now?!
   1163376|00000000||Stirring the pot, mugsy?
   1191078|00000000||Greetings.
   1191080|00000000||The famed White Wolf, I bow before you.
   1191082|00000000||Can I help you? In any way?
   1191084|00000000||How are you?
   1191086|00000000||What was that?!
   1191088|00000000||Hold on, wait…
   1191090|00000000||Please, no…
   1168267|00000000||I'm no brigand.
   1168294|00000000||Not a brigand. I'm a witcher. And your brothers sent me to help you.
   1168296|00000000||Oh, no, no no no! I refuse to believe they had a sudden change of heart. They try to kill me, then send help? I sense the stench of treachery a mile off!
   1170134|00000000||You find the missing part?
   1167454|00000000||What about the missing part? Find it?
   1169630|00000000||No. I know only that it's in this cave. Likely at the bottom of a pool.
   1169632|00000000||I feel awkward to ask, but… as I am wounded, would you be kind and retrieve it?
   1167458|00000000||Fine. I can do that.
   1169635|00000000||But you must know I… I cannot pay you well.
   1169637|00000000||Figured as much. Start producing cognac, I'll come by for a discount.
   1170232|00000000||That I promise you!
   1170234|00000000||Wait here.
   1167455|00000000||Yeah, I'll help you.
   1167456|00000000||Not about to help you.
   1167462|00000000||Sorry, but none of this is my concern.
   1170135|00000000||Couldn't care less about your missing part. Let's go.
   1170137|00000000||Fascinating, really, but I'm kinda in a hurry.
   1195083|00000000||Brothers're paying me to drag you out alive, so move.
   1170141|00000000||I am here to collect a still component, a vital one. And I shall not leave without it.
   1170152|00000000||Listen, you can move in here, for all I care, but the kikimores I killed on my way in are probably not this cave's only tenants.
   1170154|00000000||Got two options - you can come with me, or stay and look for your part. Latter involves dealing with any monsters you come across yourself. So what'll it be?
   1170177|00000000||Ehh, fine. I will go with you. Since I must…
   1194054|00000000||There you are. Why did you not return for me? The missing piece - have you found it?
   1194056|00000000||No, I haven't. First, I wanted to--
   1194058|00000000||Got it, yeah. Here. Now let's go.
   1167466|00000000||Wait, see there? My brothers. They've rounded up some thugs. They mean to attack me!
   1170341|00000000||We don't know that…
   1170343|00000000||Would you try to tell me it's a coincidence that they return with an armed band?
   1170346|00000000||They think I've the last part to the still. They would kill me for it!
   1167472|00000000||Ehh… Don't have much of a choice.
   1167474|00000000||Thanks. A thousand thanks! I shall wait here.
   1167467|00000000||Yeah, I'll make sure you're not hurt.
   1170354|00000000||Which, at any rate, we do not have.
   1208027|00000000||Just a moment. Where's the condenser?
   1208029|00000000||Right. Got it here. All yours.
   1208031|00000000||Farewell. And remember to come round.
   1195057|00000000||Just a moment. What about the condenser?
   1195059|00000000||It's here. We managed to find it while the witcher sought you out.
   1195061|00000000||The condenser found, they lived happily ever after. Farewell.
   1170448|00000000||All right. Glad to see you've made up. Now I really need to get back to my own affairs.
   1170450|00000000||Naturally. Your payment.
   1170452|00000000||We thank you for your help! Should you ever find yourself near the Clever Clogs, you must stop in. Superb cognac, some of the best.
   1170454|00000000||Will do. So long.
   1170383|00000000||What about my pay?
   1170384|00000000||Why'd you bring muscle?
   1170411|00000000||Hm. Claim to come in peace. But then who're these men?
   1170413|00000000||Hunters who had made camp nearby. They spotted us and asked if we had no need for their aid.
   1170415|00000000||You went in, were gone a long time. With these men to help, we thought we might come to your rescue.
   1170356|00000000||We're going over there. And you're gonna settle this, talk it out.
   1170358|00000000||But should they attack, you will protect me, will you not?
   1170360|00000000||If they attack, unprovoked. Let's go.
   1170372|00000000||Hugo! Are you well?
   1170374|00000000||We were worried!
   1170376|00000000||Hrmph. Why do I doubt this?
   1170378|00000000||Listen, while you were in there, we realized this tiff is… senseless, idiotic. You might have been harmed, gravely, and that's something we could never live down…
   1170382|00000000||Lucien is right. We must bury this hatchet, work together as Father wished it.
   1167476|00000000||Not about to start cutting folk down 'cause of a family squabble about some spare bit of machinery.
   1167468|00000000||No one dies. Not today.
   1170350|00000000||Please! You're my only hope. Kill them, elsewise they'll kill me!
   1195045|00000000||Kill your brothers? You want that?
   1195047|00000000||Well… Perhaps not them… But the other roughs, for certain! As to my brothers… I don't know. You couldn't, perhaps, render them harmless…? Argh, will you defend me?
   1170348|00000000||They've come for the last part of the still. They would kill me for it!
   1169652|00000000||Your pay. It is not much, I know. But I promise you good prices, the best, once the tavern is open again.
   1170331|00000000||Hold you to that.
   1170333|00000000||Now let's go. Brothers're probably getting antsy.
   1167460|00000000||Hmm. So you came here to find a piece of a still. Mean this thing?
   1169617|00000000||Yes! Where did you find it?
   1169619|00000000||Bottom of the pool of a hot spring. Really hid it well, your father.
   1170133|00000000||Found the missing part.
   1168298|00000000||Whoa, slow down. What's this about?
   1168300|00000000||Ehh. I'm Hugo Monnart. My father, Victor Monnart, you may have heard of. A cognac distiller he was, famed for it.
   1169596|00000000||Before he passed, my brothers and I would quarrel over who would inherit the family business. So Father decided he would "force" us to work together.
   1169598|00000000||He broke his still down into its parts. Three of them he hid, telling each of us the location of one.
   1170132|00000000||When my brothers learned "my" part, the last, was hidden in here, they decided they did not need me anymore. They decided to cut me out of the business - literally.
   1169626|00000000||We argued, fought… The noise must have woken the beasts. My brothers ran for the mouth, while I ran deeper in.
   1168288|00000000||What're you talking about? Ran into them outside. Claimed monsters attacked. They ran, made it out, but you got stuck inside. They asked me to help you.
   1168292|00000000||Is that what they told you? The lying weasels… More trickery on their part, I'm certain!
   1168266|00000000||What're you talking about?
   1167448|00000000||You Hugo? Your brothers sent me.
   1168263|00000000||Pshaw! Dizzards! Scoundrels! Tartmongers! They attacked me, but I fended them off. Now they send a brigand to finish the job?!
   1167470|00000000||Found the missing part. Really hid that well, your father.
   1170329|00000000||Oooh, that's fantastic!
   1170989|00000000||He's gone mad! Hold him back!
   1171133|00000000||The missing bit - so bleeding important. Please, find it.
   1171028|00000000||Fresh blood on the blade. Weapon was Hugo's maybe?
   1164857|00000000||Problem solved. Now to find Hugo.
   1167897|00000000||Damn, water's hot. Get burned if I don't watch it.
   1170494|00000000||Could use some protection… Maybe Quen'll work?
   1170470|00000000||Aargh, witcher! What are you doing?
   1188893|00000000||Teaching you some decency…
   1167895|00000000||Warm and damp… Kikimores prefer cooler environments.
   1170468|00000000||Probably why they keep their distance.
   1171026|00000000||Blood trail… Could be Hugo's wounded…
   1164863|00000000||Kikimores. Dammit.
   1170991|00000000||Get him, gents!
   1194375|00000000||Stand with me, please!
   1194379|00000000||Make no mistake! They're scurvy scoundrels!
   1194377|00000000||Rid me of them! They want my death!
   1191897|00000000||Whaddaya want? Eh?
   1191899|00000000||How are you?
   1191901|00000000||Argh… Hmpf... Mmf… Hm.
   1207626|00000000||Never retreat, not one step, not one footfall!
   1190228|00000000||Never retreat, not one step, not one footfall!
   1190230|00000000||This is your warning.
   1190232|00000000||Staging a one-man farce?
   1198342|00000000||That's him! The slayer of Starling Straggen's band!
   1190234|00000000||Praise to the grapes in whose effluent richness we drown!
   1190236|00000000||Sleep strengthens, and wine makes you sleepy. Ergo - wine strengthens!
   1196498|00000000||A knight, dear children, is a peculiar cross between a loose woman and a scholar - which is to say, he's a ploughing know-it-all!
   1198340|00000000||Pardon my tongue, but that Loth Halfbreed was a horrid bumbotcher. Good of you to kill him!
   1190238|00000000||Greetings, sourpuss!
   1190240|00000000||Why so cross? Have a tipple!
   1190246|00000000||You chose poorly, witcher!
   1190244|00000000||Cut! Slice! Smash!
   1190248|00000000||You shall perish, evil doer!
   1207622|00000000||You chose poorly, witcher!
   1207624|00000000||You shall perish, evil doer!
   1207618|00000000||Toussaint!
   1207620|00000000||Cut! Slice! Smash!
   1190242|00000000||Toussaint!
   1207628|00000000||No mercy!
   1190250|00000000||No mercy!
   1182406|00000000||{Que'sse bàithse geabh!} [Did I ever choose a good port!]
   1182404|00000000||White for breakfast, red for supper!
   1182408|00000000||You lose your oar?
   1182410|00000000||What's that?
   1184927|00000000||You're not from here, are you?
   1184929|00000000||Why are you here?
   1191812|00000000||What do you expect of us, witcher, thanks? But saving folk - that's just your job, isn't it?
   1208579|00000000||During the soiree organized by the Mandragora, Geralt met Orianna, a valued patroness to many local artists. There was something about this woman that made most who met her feel somehow ill at ease. She could not break the witcher’s iron-hard self-composure, of course, but she did give him the impression she was no normal aristocrat – and his impressions were usually spot-on.<br>
   1208580|00000000||Regis' charismatic friend was revealed to be a fellow vampire, though nowhere near as civilized and humanitarian as he. She owned an orphanage outside the city which, as the witcher discovered to his horror, she used as a sort of blood cellar, visiting it whenever the urge struck her to drink some blood straight from an orphan’s neck. Geralt swore that if they ever met again…
   1208578|00000000||Orianna

   1164246|00000000||You've precisely one hour to pack your things.
   1164248|00000000||What?? I don't understand…
   1164250|00000000||I will not be played for a fool! You know exactly why. Now go, get to it!
   1195678|00000000||Not now, master… Give me peace.
   1195680|00000000||I knew this place was no good for me!
   1151910|8f40e11d||Unseen Elder
   1191779|00000000||It would've ended horribly had you not helped us, witcher…
   1207717|00000000||Monsters! Monsters attacking!
   1207719|00000000||They'll slaughter us! Leg it!
   1207721|00000000||Beisten! Monsters! Help!

   1194575|00000000||Morning, morning!
   1194577|00000000||Welcome.
   1194579|00000000||Yes?
   1194581|00000000||Are you all right?
   1194583|00000000||Get off!
   1194587|00000000||Please, no!
   1204765|00000000||Talk to the foreman of Ardaiso Quarry.
   1197496|00000000||Help all the builders who are working on the monument.
   1207237|00000000||Go see the foreman about your reward.
   1208753|00000000||[Optional] Visit the building site.
   1197495|00000000||Yet a bursting purse of crowns was not Geralt's sole compensation. After all, thanks to his guile and valor yet another of the world's wonders now rose high into the sky!<br>
   1204764|00000000||All signs seemed to suggest the statue and those working on it suffered from a hefty dose of rotten luck. With the help the witcher had provided, the quarry was now operating normally, yet fresh trouble appeared almost at once…<br>
   1197494|00000000||The foreman was forced to enlist the witcher's aid again when a group of builders and the architect disappeared along the road leading to the building site!<br>
   1207238|00000000||Our friend and hero, however, quickly solved the mystery and could thus return to the foreman to collect his well-deserved reward.<br>

   1171564|00000000||Next!
   1178062|00000000||Paul, the witcher, take him to the tower! That's an order!
   1178064|00000000||An order's an order… Guess you're not next after all. Follow me.
   1150278|00000000||Marc Dubois, you are hereby judged guilty of trampling Alice Valraff, the cupbearer's wife, while on horseback. The woman's condition is critical.
   1159505|00000000||It was an accident! I was riding fast, true, but she jumped out in front me!
   1159509|00000000||In light of the above, there can be but one sentence - death by decapitation.
   1150307|00000000||No! I didn't do anything! Help! There must be witnesses!
   1159513|00000000||Off with his head!
   1176906|00000000||Ahem. Might I suggest you use Orianna's key?
   1159231|00000000||I'll fly ahead. Reconnoiter a bit.
   1159233|00000000||I see you've strayed from the course… Very well, go wild. I shall await you on the other side.
   1159249|00000000||Whoa. Got company.
   1159575|00000000||Then we must give them a proper welcome.
   1162236|00000000||Where'd the Unseen's hatred of social calls come from? Folk forget to wipe their boots? He get sick of sweeping up all the time?
   1162238|00000000||Hm. It's somewhat more complex.
   1162240|00000000||Tell me slowly, don't use complicated words, and I might just understand.
   1162278|00000000||I don't doubt your intelligence, but… well, it's just hard to explain to a human.
   1162242|00000000||This world is a foreign land to us. Unpleasant. Hostile, even.
   1162279|00000000||The Elder does what he can to isolate, protect himself. And we, as all guests, hinder him in this endeavor.
   1159227|00000000||Know much about this Unseen Elder?
   1159229|00000000||Only that he takes unkindly to guests. Especially the unannounced.
   1159589|00000000||Oh, joy… Got a plan, some idea how to appease him?
   1162272|00000000||Hm. The custom when meeting an Unseen Elder is to bestow upon him a stone symbolizing peace. Yet this type of stone occurs only in Haakland.
   1162274|00000000||Take it you're fresh out.
   1162276|00000000||Alas, just so. Thus I fear we must rely on my personal charm.
   1176904|00000000||Geralt! Over here.
   1159221|00000000||What's inside? Know what to expect?
   1159223|00000000||Hmm… vampires?
   1159225|00000000||Funny.
   1159219|00000000||It worked. And a good thing, too, I'd be hard pressed to seep through this gate as a puff of fog.
   1181541|00000000||Let's find the Unseen One first. Then we'll talk.
   1181543|00000000||Geralt, I adore our conversations, I do. But this is simply not the right time.
   1186718|00000000||Long live Geralt of Rivia! Long live the duquessa!
   1186720|00000000||I shall drink to your health, Sir Geralt!
   1186716|00000000||One more! And another two!
   1186714|00000000||And now I shall drink… dance… and repeat till the week is through!
   1186722|00000000||Ehh, surely you jest!
   1197445|00000000||Hah! You've had one too many and have started spouting drivel.
   1197443|00000000||Oooh! Really?!
   1197451|00000000||I heard someone's made off with Reginald d'Aubry's magic stones!
   1197449|00000000||In the Caroberta Woods, amidst elven ruins, squats a sylvan. Whosoever kisses its bum will be showered with gold!
   1197447|00000000||The Monnart Brothers have reconciled and now produce a cognac so fine, it'll soon bring in more coin than all of Castel Ravello!
   1186728|00000000||A tip of the glass, good fellow!
   1186724|00000000||Well, well! Greetings!
   1186726|00000000||Busy hands, haven't we?
   1194975|00000000||Help! Save me!
   1194977|00000000||Hmmm.
   1194979|00000000||Good day.
   1194982|00000000||Oh my…
   1194986|00000000||Who'd have thought…
   1184467|00000000||While searching for diagrams that would let him craft grandmaster level gear from the School of the Cat, Geralt happened on the trail of a tale that looked to be headed towards a tragic ending. The adventure began with the witcher's afternoon visit to the estate of a certain armorer…<br>
   1184468|00000000||…And concluded in a cave known as the Pits of Brume, where diagrams had patiently waited long years for one who would find them. As it so happens, this finder proved to be Geralt. Along the way the story had featured characters plagued by greed, ambition unfulfilled, and the longing for freedom and change. Alas, the witcher alone proved fortunate in this tale, for he finally found what he had set out to seek.<br>
   1184460|00000000||Find the hidden diagrams.
   1184466|00000000||Read the witcher's journal.
   1189846|00000000||Enter the Pits of Brume.
   1189848|00000000||Go to Bartolomé de Launay's house.
   1189847|00000000||Find a way into the estate's grounds.
   1184461|00000000||Search the estate.
   1201965|00000000||Go to the ruins of Arthach Palace.
   1184462|00000000||Explore the ruins of Arthach Palace.
   1185360|00000000||Find the entrance to the Pits of Brume.
   1184465|00000000||Read the letter to Bartolomé de Launay.
   1184464|00000000||Read the bandit leader's report.
   1204698|00000000||Find all the diagrams in the set:

   1209619|00000000||Around here, it's wine, wine and more wine! But me, I prefer brandy.
   1209621|00000000||La dee dee dah dah!
   1209617|00000000||Ooh! Here he comes - our hero! Geralt the Riv!
   1209623|00000000||Finish him good!
   1209627|00000000||One, two! And through and through!
   1209629|00000000||Snicker-snack! Snicker-snack! Break the rotten bum hole's back!
   1209631|00000000||Come rain or sun, it shall be fun!
   1209625|00000000||Death! Pain! You shall be slain!
   1209633|00000000||Am I invisible?!
   1209635|00000000||Try that on me, you boots of the puss!
   1209637|00000000||Bloody blazes, calm down!
   1209639|00000000||Onward, onward, onward!
   1209641|00000000||I've got something of my own to pull out!
   1209643|00000000||He's some sort of mage!
   1209645|00000000||If that's your stance, then this is mine…
   1209647|00000000||Much better!
   1209651|00000000||Brandy and bosoms - my two true loves.
   1209649|00000000||Catch some winks, grab some tit - it's what life's all about, isn't it?
   1171449|00000000||Fifth victim - know who it was supposed to be.
   1171451|00000000||Got some important information. Anna Henrietta was supposed to be Dettlaff and Syanna's fifth victim.
   1171453|00000000||You are certain of this?
   1181019|00000000||Completely. Found proof.
   1177099|00000000||Inconceivable. How could she?! The murders, the mayhem she brought down on the city - were they not enough? She sought to strike down her own sister?! Her liege? The traitor.
   1171455|00000000||I must alert my men, enlarge the duchess' honor guard, make certain Sylvia Anna is closely watched during the questioning. I'll see to it personally.
   1177101|00000000||I thank you, witcher. For alerting me. And I appreciate your attentiveness.
   1207260|00000000||Very well, let us get things underway. Don your ceremonial attire. Then you'll come with me. Her Grace awaits.
   1181078|00000000||Let's begin the ceremony. Come with me. The duchess awaits.
   1151460|00000000||All right. We can start.
   1161577|00000000||Very well. But you must behave. Less like a hired thug and more like a man deserving of the duchy's highest honor.
   1161579|00000000||In fact, you'd do best to maintain a dignified silence throughout.
   1167395|00000000||We can start.
   1184088|00000000||Don't look too good.
   1184090|00000000||Your face. Doesn't look good.
   1184103|00000000||What the hell happened?
   1184138|00000000||The city was attacked. Surely you don't imagine I could stand and watch it all from some ivory tower?
   1184092|00000000||Though it looked even worse last I saw you.
   1184094|00000000||I apply a balm of arnica. I hardly feel it anymore.
   1167979|00000000||Damien.
   1167981|00000000||Geralt! It's about time. Ready for the ceremony?

   1201512|00000000||Be cautious… guard Her Grace closely.
   1201510|00000000||Good luck. I hope you get the bastard.
   1201534|00000000||Hmm… I should double the patrols. Just in case.
   1201532|00000000||Audacious rat, the Cintrian… But we'll get him.
   1194991|00000000||{*Panting*}
   1194994|00000000||I feel faint, my head spins.
   1194996|00000000||I must see a medic.
   1150030|00000000||[Blunt trauma wounds on the cow.]
   1150041|00000000||Tissue's crushed in places. Must've fallen from quite a height.
   1150031|00000000||[Bite wounds on the cow.]
   1150039|00000000||Gut's sliced open, hmm. Not much blood, so it happened after death. Heart had already stopped pumping.
   1155766|00000000||Tooth marks… small ones, though… so necrophages left 'em, clearly. Sure sniffed out their feast fast.
   1150032|00000000||[Punctures and slashes on the cow.]
   1150035|00000000||Deep claw wounds. Spread between talons indicates a draconid, a wyvern, probably. But these wounds weren't the cause of death.
   1150028|00000000||Must be Emil, workers mentioned him. Poor guy, unlucky as all hell…
   1202616|00000000||Right, now where do I start…?
   1202617|00000000||[Wounds on the worker's body.]
   1202621|00000000||Crushed by something heavy… Skull base is cracked.
   1202623|00000000||Fresh tooth marks - necrophages, but they got to him after his death.
   1202625|00000000||Won't learn anything else from the body.
   1203413|00000000||Got it. All clear, now. Cow died when it fell from a great height. Draconid must've dropped it. A youngster, probably, trying to get the cow back to its nest, but it proved too heavy. Emil's bad luck to be standing right underneath.
   1203415|00000000||And then there's the crane.
   1150029|00000000||[Cause of the accident.]
   1150033|00000000||[Leave.]
   1150043|00000000||Right.

   1183793|00000000||Here in Toussaint, we've no penchant for living to work nor working to live nor working at all.
   1183797|00000000||My oh my!
   1183795|00000000||I see you, see you, but wouldn't want to be you!
   1186902|00000000||You! Travel much?
   1186900|00000000||Is it true? In Novigrad, they eat tripe in oil? Yuck!
   1186906|00000000||Do they pay you well, witcher? Enough for wine and women? Teeheehee.
   1186904|00000000||Ooh! The witcher! The one the duquessa summoned!
   1201482|00000000||A feast without Geralt de Rivia's like a knight without a crest!
   1173892|00000000||We must visit the shelter, look around inside.

   1191277|00000000||Ahh, give it a rest.
   1165306|00000000||Time is no cock. It keeps going.
   1165308|00000000||Drinking - the most fun you can have with your clothes on.
   1193574|00000000||Get it while you can, our next ruler might ban free love…
   1165304|00000000||In the mood for fireworks and action?
   1165302|00000000||How do you like to do it?
   1164212|00000000||Daphne's kerchief - we'll use it to lift the curse.
   1163894|00000000||But we gotta start at the right time. When the hour comes, I'll light four fires for the four winds, then begin the ritual.
   1163896|00000000||Fires? Then I shall be of use to you, after all. Seems you need wood, much of it!
   1163898|00000000||Chop as much as you can. I'll see to the rest.
   1164210|00000000||I can lift the curse, free her. By performing a ritual, making a sacrifice of her kerchief and Gareth's remains.
   1163889|00000000||I know how to lift the curse, free Daphne.
   1163890|00000000||Witch isn't near as bad as you thought.
   1163900|00000000||That witch? She's not near as bad as folk say.
   1163902|00000000||Made me bow and scrape, sure, but I know some sorceresses witchier than her.
   1163904|00000000||Joyous bleeding news, but what about Daphne?!
   1162185|00000000||So? You met the witch, you must have. What did you learn?
   1162560|00000000||I've chopped and stacked the wood. What now?
   1162193|00000000||My turn. Gotta light fires and talk to the woman enchanted in the tree.
   1163908|00000000||No idea how this'll turn out, so just in case, stand at a distance.
   1163910|00000000||And if you see me draw my sword, run.
   1205537|00000000||Trail ends here. Nest's up there - I'd bet the farm on it.
   1211247|00000000||Might wanna take a look. Just to be sure.
   1211217|00000000||Trail ends here. Hm… been up here already.
   1186584|00000000||Ehh… Actually, I'd love to go home.
   1194428|00000000||Wha?
   1194430|00000000||Awful tired for some reason…
   1194432|00000000||Yaaawn…
   1144953|00000000||Pickled… herring… Blech…
   1144951|00000000||Is it true? They eat pickled herring in Skellige?
   1144955|00000000||Sheathe that blade!
   1144959|00000000||Oh, we will thump you good…
   1144961|00000000||Not very frisky for a witcher!
   1144957|00000000||Seems this is your end, Master Witcher!
   1144965|00000000||I wonder what the old lady's fixing for supper.
   1144963|00000000||I could go for some foie gras… A nice, rich hunk, with onion and mustard seed…
   1144967|00000000||A thousand pickled herrings!
   1191137|00000000||Ehh.
   1191143|00000000||Hey!
   1191139|00000000||Well met.
   1191141|00000000||La la la lala la.
   1191145|00000000||Did you hear that?
   1191147|00000000||Oh no!
   1191149|00000000||Stay calm. Just stay calm!
   1191151|00000000||Gods save me!
   1171585|00000000||You have no need for a servant, perchance, master witcher?
   1193505|00000000||A sure way to banish the Beast? Send north for a witcher and let his swords fly!
   1171583|00000000||Master witcher, here to hunt the Beast?
   1171587|00000000||Monster slayer!
   1171589|00000000||Witcher.
   1184847|00000000||Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool!
   1184845|00000000||With a moo moo here, and a moo moo there…
   1176147|00000000||Assassin of kings, friend of duchesses.
   1176145|00000000||My respects!
   1176150|00000000||Hey there! Do not make me call the Guard!
   1198869|00000000||You simply bring misfortune to all crowned heads. That must be it.
   1176161|00000000||Witcher, have you any surplus coin? Invest it in wine!
   1176159|00000000||The fruit of your vines grow fat and juicy!
   1205351|00000000||At long last, after numerous trials and tribulations, Geralt managed to assemble all the diagrams from a single witchers' school, diagrams that would allow the armorer to produce a complete set of gear at grandmaster level. Lafargue was consumed by joy. At last he could get to work and fulfill his dream. For he had no doubt he would succeed in creating a wondrous suit of witcher armor worthy of his deceased master.<br>
   1208433|00000000||Finding a grandmaster armorer borders on being a miracle. The world is full of rumors about elves and dwarves with a thorough mastery of the art of shaping leather and metal. The sad thing is most of these tales contend that all of them have long been dead. Yet as the Good Book sayeth, "Ask, and ye shall be answered. Seek, and ye shall find."<br>
   1208434|00000000||Imagine Geralt's delight when he happened on an exceptionally talented amorer, and one eager to work! This man's name was Lafargue, and he had been an apprentice of an elven master of the craft. Lafargue possessed not only the required skills, but he also knew where our witcher might find some lost grandmaster level diagrams hailing from five witcher schools.<br><br>Geralt made a deal with Lafargue - he promised to find the diagrams, while the craftsman pledged to produce gear for the witcher based on them. For you ought to know that this armorer's greatest dream in life was to produce the most perfect set of witcher gear. Doing so would mean that Lafargue had fulfilled his guild's final requirement and he could thereafter term himself a grandmaster. All Geralt had to do was to find the lost diagrams.<br>
   1205350|00000000||Searching for a master armorer is not unlike searching for a needle in a haystack. This applies all the more to grandmasters with sufficient skills to produce elements of grandmaster level gear based on appropriate diagrams! Yet Geralt had found on just such a valuable drawing. Thus, what could our witcher do but put his nose to the ground and start searching.<br>
   1210263|00000000||While in Toussaint, one day Geralt found a notice posted by an armorer. Since to the witcher a good suit is potentially a matter of life or death, and since he had always benefited from working relationships he had struck up with able plate bangers, our hero debated the issue only briefly before resolving to visit the artisan.<br>
   1205339|00000000||Ask Lafargue about all the vanished witchers.
   1207976|00000000||Find all the grandmaster diagrams of one witcher school.
   1207977|00000000||Take the diagrams to Lafargue so he can become a grandmaster.
   1210264|00000000||Find the grandmaster smith Lafargue so you can make use of his services.
   1208432|00000000||Find someone who can forge grandmaster witcher gear.
   1212826|00000000||Ask Lafargue about the contract.
   1205338|00000000||Master Master Master Master!

   1208485|00000000||Vivienne de Tabris was Anna Henrietta’s lady-in-waiting. She was a tight-lipped, secretive, inaccessible person, but her beauty fascinated men. Geralt saw proof of this when he took a contract from Guillaume, who was in love with her and suspected she might be afflicted by a curse. In order to get an audience with her, Geralt had to take part in the knights’ tourney, where Vivienne was acting as the patroness.<br>
   1208486|00000000||By following Vivienne and examining the evidence, Geralt discovered Guillaume was right. Vivienne had indeed been struck by a powerful curse before she was even born. This curse caused her to turn into a bird whenever the moon was out. Geralt listened to the story of the curse, then offered to try to lift it. He warned her that this would not be a simple matter. The curse could be transferred to another, but Vivienne did not want to agree to that. It could also be removed entirely, but then it was possible Vivienne would only have a few years left to live.<br>
   1208487|00000000||Geralt decided to tell Guillaume what he had learned. Guillaume offered his help in lifting the curse – and declared he was willing to take that burden upon himself.<br>
   1208488|00000000||Geralt kept the information Vivienne had confided to him secret, even though Guillaume was determined to help her any way he could.<br>
   1208489|00000000||Thanks to the information Geralt had gathered, Guillaume convinced Vivienne to let him take the curse upon himself. According to Geralt, the spell would have much weaker effects once transferred. Vivienne believed Guillaume had the best of intentions and decided to trust him.<br><br>The three of them performed the ritual, lifting the curse from Vivienne. As for Guillaume, he noticed no immediate changes.<br>
   1208490|00000000||Guillaume tried to convince Vivienne he only wanted what was best for her, but she preferred to remain independent. She and Geralt conducted the ritual together, lifting the curse.<br>
   1208491|00000000||Guillaume and Vivienne grew close. The curse caused the knight to grow feathers on strange parts of his body, but that did not bother him overly much. As for Vivienne, she was rather fond of them.
   1208492|00000000||Vivienne felt free for the first time in her life. She decided to make maximal use of the time remaining to her and set out to travel the world.

   1185484|00000000||A dog jostled your mum!
   1198611|00000000||They say that witcher from the North is a deviant. Apparently, he enjoys posing for paintings, his willy dangling out!
   1198613|00000000||They had miracle over at the Ardaiso quarry. Beef plummeting from the heavens! The workers have hung up their pickaxes and taken to grilling steak instead!
   1198609|00000000||There's this hairdresser - a real artiste, you know. Well he gave up his position at court, saying "Sod it all," and now shears sheep in some meadow!
   1198615|00000000||I don't give a wet slit tickle.
   1198617|00000000||Oh, I'm not sure about that. Perhaps it's true, perhaps it's not.
   1185488|00000000||Our duquessa's a lovely lass, ehh, you scamp, you?
   1185492|00000000||I wager you must beat the maidens back with a long stick, eh, tourney champion?
   1185490|00000000||Heheh. It matters not that a man's fit as a fiddle if he never gives his lady a roaring diddle! Hahaha!
   1185486|00000000||That's a hero! Comely, valiant, voluptuous!
   1185498|00000000||Why, you cheeky rake! Hahaha!
   1185494|00000000||May fortune shower down upon you!
   1185496|00000000||Oh, you hound hugger!
   1194287|00000000||Not here. You wouldn't happen to know…
   1194289|00000000||Where else he might be found? Alas, I've not a clue. I know he works each day from dawn to dusk - but never at night.
   1194518|00000000||Guess we gotta wait, then.
   1104519|00000000||Are you blind, sir? I'm at work, here.
   1124344|00000000||There's a catch… Zzz… Catch-22… Zzzzzz….
   1124346|00000000||Zzzz… Coin… always… ahem… right.
   1124417|00000000||We will no longer serve you here. Please go.
   1104517|00000000||Welcome to Cianfanelli Bank, where we look after your coin as if it were our own and the customer's always right. How might I be of service?
   1107944|00000000||Changing the subject…
   1107958|00000000||Got something else I need.
   1107960|00000000||Yes?
   1104418|00000000||Need to change some coin.
   1104531|00000000||I'd like to change some coin.
   1104533|00000000||By all means.
   1107934|00000000||Got an account here. Like to make a withdrawal.
   1107936|00000000||Naturally. Your name?

   1107940|00000000||Wait a moment, please, while I find the relevant record.
   1108576|00000000||I'm afraid I can't help you. Extraordinary circumstances, you see? There's a note in the records - the account holder is dead.
   1108578|00000000||That's inaccurate, as you can see.
   1108580|00000000||It's some kind of mistake. The note is clearly in error. To reactivate the account, you'll need Permit A38.

   1108619|00000000||Yes? How can I help?
   1107941|00000000||Any way to do this without the permit?
   1107946|00000000||There any way I could get this done quicker, without the permit, maybe?
   1107948|00000000||Very sorry, but that's impossible. Circular N60, the latest, is very clear on the point - Permit A38 is absolutely necessary.
   1135290|00000000||Form 202, please.
   1135304|00000000||Form 202 - can I have a copy?
   1135306|00000000||Oh, no, none here, I'm afraid. Please ask in Archives or in Records.
   1170530|00000000||Where can I get a copy of Permit A38?
   1135292|00000000||Sorry, where can I get a copy of Permit A38?
   1135294|00000000||Hmm… Let me think… Marianne, dear, would you know who has A38s?
   1135298|00000000||Very sorry, we simply don't know. You must ask around.
   1108105|00000000||Yes? No, I'm not the one you need, definitely.
   1104521|00000000||I'm sorry, I've no time just now. Please see someone else.
   1124062|00000000||Please bother someone else.
   1196323|00000000||Humblest greetings.
   1196325|00000000||Greetings to you, sir.

   1189260|00000000||Hm, wonder if I'll find anything Merten left behind here.
   1188978|00000000||Hmm… Notes in the journal suggest that straight out of prison Merten went to the legendary cave. Lebioda was supposed to have hunkered down there once…
   1206128|00000000||That's my next destination.
   1173261|00000000||The Ducal Guard buys its steel from me!

   1173267|00000000||Too wide to step aside, are you?!
   1173269|00000000||Do you not fear the Guard?!
   1182483|00000000||Calm down or you'll taste the back of my hand!
   1182489|00000000||With the Beast beat down, the Belles should be particularly eager to please!
   1182491|00000000||Hey! Tourney champion! The Belles must give you one hefty reduction!
   1182485|00000000||Rosie, you're all right - you wear my ring. When you hold me tight - Rosie, that's my thing…
   1182487|00000000||Come evening, I'm off to the Belles, quick as a flash! Those girls can't wait to see me…

   1202725|00000000||What the d'yaeble's taking them? Go see.
   1202727|00000000||They're coming in the other side! There's one!
   1206161|00000000||While helping Liam de Coronata restore his vineyard to its former glory, Geralt, nosy as ever, came upon a letter…<br>
   1206162|00000000||He learned of a worker at Coronata who had been disloyal to his employer, selling spiced wine on the side at quite a premium. The gold he had earned through his wicked ways now lay buried…. beneath a pile of manure!<br>
   1206163|00000000||A kayran's mucous, the excretions of grave hags - in the face of these and other forms of filth, the witcher had always remained undeterred. So a healthy, natural, rotting pile of compost could never rattle him. He plunged his arms into the heap and pulled out a hefty pouch. Its contents would be his, he decided, recompense for the nauseating stench he had had to endure.<br>
   1214154|00000000||While traversing the roads and backwoods of Toussaint, Geralt happened upon two wild rock trolls who seemed vehemently to want disembowel the witcher. As he had through his life grown attached to his entrails, he drew his sword and defeated the beasts in a spectacular struggle. While ferreting about the area where they had fought, the witcher found an interesting letter…<br>
   1206159|00000000||Read the letter.
   1206160|00000000||Find the stash in the manure pile.

   1186131|00000000||Your boots could use some polish, vagrant!
   1151952|00000000||All right. Let's try again.
   1153632|00000000||Wooolves! Leg it! Run for your lives!
   1151940|00000000||Relax. It's over.
   1151942|00000000||No it's not! There's more! Another wolf! Behind you!
   1151944|00000000||Ignore him. He always lies.
   1151946|00000000||Ah ha. Boy who cried wolf. Still does, I suppose. And doesn't…. when they actually appear.
   1153622|00000000||The one and only. Listen, you little chit, Jack said you know what's become of his three beans.
   1153624|00000000||I don't know anything! Not one thing! And besides, watch out! Wolves!
   1151947|00000000||Red bean - what happened to it?
   1164581|00000000||Remind me, what happened to the red bean?
   1153673|00000000||This'll be interesting. Right, let's get to it.
   1151948|00000000||Know where the blue bean is?
   1164582|00000000||Blue bean - tell me again what happened to it.
   1151949|00000000||Let's talk about the yellow bean.
   1164583|00000000||The yellow bean - one more time, where is it?
   1151962|00000000||Yellow bean - don't know a thing about it, right…?
   1151964|00000000||Hmm…. It's somewhere very, and I mean very, deep. So deep, in fact, it's completely underground!
   1153669|00000000||And who has it? Hm?
   1153671|00000000||A bald farmhand, who in no way and not at all, awaits someone. Not in the slightest!
   1155756|00000000||Help! Wooooolves!!!
   1155759|00000000||Good folk!!! Woooolv--
   1155761|00000000||Say that word one more time, and I'll chop you up! Feed you to the fishes! Understood?
   1151958|00000000||Bet you haven't heard what happened to the blue bean. Maybe? Not at all? Right?
   1151960|00000000||I've heard it lies about somewhere, out in the open.
   1153665|00000000||Just like that? No one guarding it?
   1153667|00000000||Nobody! Three times over!
   1151954|00000000||Let's say for a minute you know what happened to the red bean… where wouldn't it be?
   1151956|00000000||For certain no one swallowed it. Oh no, definitely not that!
   1153661|00000000||Of course not. But say someone didn't, who would it be that didn't… swallow it?
   1153663|00000000||A human! The most humany human in the Land of a Thousand Fables!
   1155753|00000000||Everyone! Woooolves!!! Run!
   1173377|00000000||Tough to talk to, that one.
   1173379|00000000||Was it, though? You need merely remember he always lies… Or, more precisely, reverses the truth.
   1173381|00000000||Mhm. Where to now?
   1173391|00000000||I'm not sure… We should visit some of the other fables, the meaty ones, that is. Perhaps then Joss' hints will make more sense.
   1179367|00000000||It's just a few - Red Riding Hood, piglets and bears - three of each, and Goldilocks, of course. Then Longlocks and a little lass who sells flint.
   1179369|00000000||Ah. Fine. Let's get to work.
   1164829|00000000||Thanks for your help. So long.
   1164827|00000000||Farewell.
   1151950|00000000||We gotta go.
   1151966|00000000||All right. We should go.
   1167181|00000000||Watch out for wolves!!
   1151728|00000000||No wolves here! None at all!
   1153628|00000000||This is grand! I'm all right! Not in any danger!
   1151924|00000000||That's him! Joss! Blast, they're going to rip him in six!
   1162451|00000000||Wolves on the prowl, coming down the mountain!
   1159049|00000000||Woooooolves!
   1193426|00000000||Uh-huh?
   1191060|00000000||Aaaaaah.
   1191062|00000000||Enough.
   1191064|00000000||Good sir?
   1191066|00000000||Please, leave me alone.
   1191074|00000000||Do you really wish me to comment?
   1191076|00000000||Greetings.
   1191068|00000000||Don't push.
   1191070|00000000||The sword is un… necessary.

   1188342|00000000||The witcher had decided not to kill the wight. A fortunate decision, as the monster had proved to be a woman named Marlene, afflicted some time past by a terrible curse. The witcher had lifted the curse and learned Marlene's story. She had suffered unimaginable pain while cursed, fated forever to hunger and waste away. Geralt, big-hearted as he was, could not leave the woman to fend for herself. He invited her to stay at Corvo Bianco, the estate the duchess had granted him in recognition of his service. The estate's majordomo took Marlene under his wing. The witcher decided he would visit the cured woman several days later.<br>
   1188344|00000000||Geralt had proven a generous soul when he let Marlene recover at Corvo Bianco. After a time, they had a candid conversation, and the woman revealed her concerns. With the curse having held her for centuries, she had outlived her loved ones and was now left with no one to turn to. Time had passed, the world had progressed, and Marlene felt like a stranger within it. The witcher believed only living among other folk could restore the balance Marlene had lost. Marlene agreed and a few days later their paths diverged as she set off to make a new life for herself.<br>
   1188343|00000000||Marlene turned out to be an open and honest woman. She and Geralt had a friendly, candid conversation and decided she would remain at Corvo Bianco for the foreseeable future. She would tend to the kitchen there. Thus, in addition to Marlene's gratitude, Geralt gained an able cook (the majordomo was thought to have no culinary talents whatever, having burned several pots of water in his time). Marlene also told the witcher that a long time past her father had amassed for her a dowry that was likely to be lying undisturbed in the cellars of the Trastamara Estate.<br>
   1188341|00000000||Visit Corvo Bianco and see how Marlene is doing.
   1201806|00000000||Search for Marlene's dowry at the Trastamara estate.

   1199044|00000000||My savior! As you can see, my little misadventure did not delay construction of the monument after all!
   1188627|00000000||Guard… Guard!
   1188629|00000000||Good to see you.
   1188625|00000000||My regards.
   1188623|00000000||Unbelievable… Coronata and Vermentino, reconciled!
   1188617|00000000||Have you heard? Vermentino and Coronata have partnered up to purchase Belgaard!
   1188619|00000000||A return to traditional values and morals - that is the remedy for Toussaint's problems. Not two swords.
   1188621|00000000||Est Est flows in the veins of Toussaint!
   1199036|00000000||Good sirs… these are but tools, stone fragments for a monument!
   1199042|00000000||But why even bother? What did they hope to steal - hammers? A hunk of stone?
   1214845|00000000||I see. All right… High time I set off.
   1199040|00000000||Sir! Here! Help!
   1199038|00000000||Show those clever curs their place!
   1188615|00000000||Where are your manners?!
   1187545|00000000||Can you believe it? I was to get a new coif from Jean-Louis Ludovic. I had an appointment and all. But when I walked in… the place was empty!
   1195634|00000000||Yet the salon was unlocked? That's very unlike him…
   1195636|00000000||And it's unlike me to walk about with this bird's nest! Whatever shall I do?!
   1198933|00000000||Have you heard? Some knight nabbed Jean- Louis! Carried him off!
   1198935|00000000||A knight? Why ever for? Did our hairdresser slight his true love?
   1198937|00000000||No… He trimmed his fringe crooked!
   1186451|00000000||And where does Celestine wander of late? I did not spy him at the tourney…
   1193005|00000000||He and his squire have gone to hunt Grottore.
   1193007|00000000||By my troth… Have there been any tidings?
   1193009|00000000||No, we've not had any word. But Grottore's been seen, he prowls the fields at night… The conclusion can be only one.
   1194775|00000000||Hey, handsome!
   1194780|00000000||Oh, no.
   1194782|00000000||It's not my fault!

   1184899|00000000||Where do babies come from?
   1184897|00000000||Do you have a little brother? Or a little sister?
   1105446|00000000||Ohh… François…
   1106092|00000000||Forgive me, please… I'm in no mood for company.
   1198357|00000000||Cooled you off a bit.

   1200094|00000000||Zoltan's doing fine.
   1200098|00000000||Zoltan's just fine.
   1167427|00000000||My brother's dream has come true! Skellige in the final - and played by both contestants!
   1167429|00000000||Good luck.
   1169053|00000000||In the… pre-final Count Monnier, representing the Skellige faction, shall face Geralt of Rivia, also playing with a Skellige deck.
   1198371|00000000||In the… pre-final Count Monnier, representing the Skellige faction, shall face Ambassador von Hinn, playing Nilfgaard!
   1200100|00000000||Attention, everyone! Our outin's taken a new turn! We're to sit and drink vodka with Zoltan's pal!
   1200102|00000000||Gentlemen, wait. We've still the final round of the tourney to play.
   1200104|00000000||Final? Fuck that! I, Yaki Rafiberg, do hereby declare my participation in this tournament! And I demand to play the victor! We'll settle whether this Skellige faction's worth a flamin' bag o' shite! Once an' for all!
   1200106|00000000||Agreed, but please show some patience. We must first play… a pre-final.
   1200096|00000000||Was in Novigrad last I saw him. Be glad to tell you more over a flask of something strong.
   1200093|00000000||Be glad to tell you - over a bottle.
   1199870|00000000||Enough! I shall summon the Guard.
   1199872|00000000||I got this, Count…
   1199875|00000000||Sure, you can shut this tournament down. But there'll be another. With who-knows-what new rules.
   1199879|00000000||If you don't like 'em, don't enter. Play somewhere else, however you want. But you'll never stop other folk from playing however they like.
   1199881|00000000||Bollocks!
   1199883|00000000||Like my good friend Zoltan Chivay says, if one says you're talking bollocks, they could be right, they could be wrong. But if multiples say you're talking bollocks, well, you probably are. So let's take a vote - who else here thinks I'm full of it?
   1199885|00000000||Zoltan Chivay? Havenae seen that rascal in ages! How's he doin'?
   1198361|00000000||Had enough? Still got the urge tae add new factions?
   1113321|73cd26c9||Incubus
   1198465|00000000||Sir Geralt, you knew no competition at the tourney!
   1198463|00000000||Sir Ravix, you knew no competition at the tourney!
   1190467|00000000||The camerlengo best not be late with my pay…
   1190465|00000000||Drizzlespit, I've not a copper of my wages left…
   1190473|00000000||I shall take care of you soon enough!
   1190471|00000000||Let us get this over with.
   1190469|00000000||Ptooey. There's no point in prolonging this…
   1190475|00000000||Yes?
   1190477|00000000||I'm listening.
   1190479|00000000||Why be you so plucky?
   1197201|00000000||The denizens of the Land of a Thousand Fables had problems, just like you or I… Balbina the Goose, for example, had the disturbing impression someone was watching her, with the intent of causing her harm – she had thus posted a notice on the fable world’s notice board. The golden egg laying bird was lucky a witcher happened to appear in the area shortly afterwards. Since time in this strange realm flowed differently, Geralt could take on this unusual contract with a clear conscience, knowing his urgent matters in Toussaint could wait.<br>
   1197202|00000000||While traversing the Land of a Thousand Fables, Geralt came across an abandoned little home. All around it lay plucked out goose feathers, suggesting there had been some kind of struggle, perhaps resulting in an abduction. The witcher being a witcher, he decided to investigate just what had happened.<br>
   1197211|00000000||The goose had indeed been kidnapped. The evildoer was a bandit named Redbeard, who had planned to force the poor bird to lay eggs made of precious metals for his profit. Geralt foiled this scheme through deft work with his blade – his usual method. Then he needed merely find the key to the cage and free the captured fowl.<br>
   1197212|00000000||The goose rewarded Geralt’s efforts by laying a golden egg for him. What Geralt did with that egg, I unfortunately do not know…
   1165260|00000000||Go to the goose's home.
   1165261|00000000||Use your Witcher Senses to find the goose.
   1165262|00000000||Follow the tracks.
   1165263|00000000||Defeat Redbeard and his bandits.
   1165264|00000000||Use your Witcher Senses to find the key to the cage.
   1165265|00000000||Let the goose out of the cage.
   1165568|00000000||Duck, Duck, Goosed!
   1208526|7e040976||Pinastri
   1162779|00000000||Master Graylocks, slip us a crown!
   1162777|00000000||My gut is empty, my platter's clean.
   1192901|00000000||Sir Frostylocks, was it you who won the tourney?
   1162781|00000000||I was an Ofieri prince once!
   1162783|00000000||Thus spake Lebioda - man's root for lust is the coin of aaaaaall evil!
   1191830|00000000||Geralt of Rivia! We are your debtors eternal!

   1163502|543105de||Benoit
   1194556|00000000||Yes, witcher?
   1194558|00000000||Take care, stay safe.
   1194560|00000000||Yes, yes…
   1194562|00000000||Don't push!
   1194564|00000000||Aaaaah!
   1194566|00000000||Mugger!
   1191844|00000000||You brought peace and somehow even made our ladies more eager! A thousand thanks, White One!
   1212727|1ee5ed32||Caretaker
   1210443|00000000||Whatever shall I do…?
   1210445|00000000||Leave me be, witcher.
   1202164|00000000||Witcher! Glad to see you!
   1202166|00000000||To have one like you side with me - it's priceless!
   1185419|00000000||Leave us be!
   1185417|00000000||Please leave. This is a private alcove.
   1182600|00000000||I titled this sculpture "The Beast's Suffering." It represents the problems of contemporary man…
   1182602|00000000||Form exists in the material from the start. One must simply liberate it.
   1182846|00000000||Blah blah blah… Avant-garde, schmavant-garde - it's all about two things - coin and copulation.
   1182844|00000000||Pretentious…?! I was prepared for all sorts of criticism, but pretentious…?!
   1189887|00000000||So much time I spent polishing that one-man play…
   1189889|00000000||And Countess de Savelle was there - that's the worst… Now she will never look me in the eye.
   1199527|00000000||But are you sure it's an original…?
   1182848|00000000||My employer swears it. Besides, have you not heard the news?
   1182850|00000000||Have I not heard?! It's on everyone's lips!
   1189968|00000000||Four de Touvettes in one night… the theft of the century.
   1189970|00000000||And here you are offering one to me…
   1182852|00000000||If you are not interested, sir, I am sure someone else…
   1182854|00000000||Right! Fine! You can't think I'd let such an opportunity pass?! How much?
   1189902|00000000||Slow down. You have declared your intent. Now I will convey this to my client.
   1189904|00000000||We shall get back to you. Please await word.
   1182864|00000000||It's an outrage! Cecilia never should have performed tonight! You should have!
   1182866|00000000||It seems "someone" decided otherwise.
   1189972|00000000||That "someone" knows nothing of true art…
   1189974|00000000||It shall be you next time. Trust me, I shall have a word with Orianna personally.
   1182858|00000000||As for that stipend - I'm sure you understand there are a great many highly qualified candidates…
   1182860|00000000||Then I shall have to convince you your ample generosity would be best-invested in me…
   1189850|00000000||Hmm… and how do you aim to do that?
   1189852|00000000||I shall arrange a private performance… After the soirée.
   1189854|00000000||Ah, my dear… I sense you've a knack for persuasion…
   1182069|00000000||Color is but the shadow of deliberations on the nature of existence. It is irrelevant to the work's ultimate meaning.
   1182053|00000000||We must throw off the manacles of form. Venture beyond the bounds of cognition.
   1185423|00000000||We wish to be alone. Please leave.
   1185421|00000000||We are busy.
   1182612|00000000||Do not touch the artwork!
   1207876|00000000||To free a stone's subtle soul requires great precision.
   1207878|00000000||Please do not disturb. One false move could prove ruinous to the entire communal effort.
   1182937|00000000||Hear that? Another interloper on the balcony!
   1182939|00000000||The absinthe's addled your mind… Deal the cards, let's get on with it.
   1191948|00000000||Fuck off…
   1191950|00000000||Bleugh akh. Uuuugh! Aww, shit.
   1200836|00000000||Just need to pick an entry.
   1200620|00000000||The eighteenth of Yule, year eleven hundred and two. Today I begin my great life's endeavor, one greater and more significant than any I have thus far undertaken, for it relates to me personally - to myself and my son.
   1200873|00000000||When fifteen years past a beast of the forest assaulted me, a witcher came to my aid, saved my life. I could not know that for said salvation I would in the end pay by relinquishing any say as to my own son's fate.
   1200875|00000000||Had I the skill to turn back time, I would have done so and perished rather than surrender to the witchers my only son. But as it was, on the day when Jerome was taken, I swore an oath on my honor that I would recover my son.
   1200880|00000000||Today, following years of research and preparation, I have at last devised a device that allows me to study mutations. If the gods in their goodness grant me but a bit of favor, I shall find a way to reverse said mutations and restore Jerome to a normal life.
   1200882|00000000||So… professor wasn't out to enhance witcher mutations. Wanted to reverse them. Wonder if he managed. And if there's anything in it for me.
   1200614|00000000||Third entry.
   1200805|00000000||Observation number thirty: The mutations do not set in at once. Curiously, they do not develop over a span of time. Rather, for a mutation to progress towards completion, the appropriate mutagen must be applied continuously.
   1200807|00000000||The subject does not bear this well, but I've found a way to make the mutations less taxing, invasive. To the mutagen base, I add the albumen of a mutated giant centipede egg. Stored in a glass terrarium, the eggs do not develop, remain small.
   1200924|00000000||The eggs themselves are a sight to behold - mutated, they are luminescent, emitting a wondrous glow. I can only hope my addition of the albumen will produce no significant side effects. Time will tell.
   1200904|00000000||Hm. So the professor wanted to reverse the mutations' effects. Ended up deepening them… Stroke of luck for me. Could profit from his failure.
   1200613|00000000||Second entry.
   1200616|00000000||Fourth entry.
   1200813|00000000||Observation fifty-eight: Sometimes failure is the catalyst for success. I've discovered a method by which one type of mutagen may be transmuted into another through the addition of certain ingredients. This is a great day for science!
   1200898|00000000||In addition, I observed that today's dose of mutagens brought the subject to the brink of death. He then suddenly awoke, revived, his strength renewed. Not wholly, of course, but he did in a sense come back from the edge of death.
   1200817|00000000||Whether this is attributable to his mutations or to pure coincidence cannot be ascertained. I must conduct further experiments.
   1200809|00000000||Observation twenty-two: Despite applying a surfeit of toxic substances, significantly more than usual, the subject displayed no symptoms of overdosing.
   1200811|00000000||I believe this to be an effect of the mutations. Thus, a minor success - this mutation should allow Jerome better to tolerate toxicity.
   1200615|00000000||[No crystal.]
   1200612|00000000||[No crystal.]
   1200630|00000000||Crystal with this entry's missing. Might be somewhere. Should look around.
   1200745|00000000||So… professor tried to neutralize the effects of witcher mutations. Only managed to enhance them, though.
   1200966|00000000||Used the albumens of giant centipede eggs as his mutagen base. Need to go on an egg hunt.
   1200743|00000000||Let's summarize.
   1200617|00000000||Fifth entry.
   1200838|00000000||Seen enough.
   1200618|00000000||[Leave.]
   1199629|00000000||First entry.
   1200823|00000000||Years of experiments, research, sacrifice - all for naught! I have failed to achieve my defined objective.
   1200825|00000000||Each mutation I applied to my subjects proved ineffective when applied to Jerome.
   1200827|00000000||What I meant to "cure" him of his witcherism, that which I meant to restore to him a normal life, only deepened his mutations, further augmented his speed and strength, rendered him yet more inhuman.
   1200829|00000000||It seems my son must remain a witcher forever. I have failed. The time has come to abandon this place, return home, to Lydia. She may yet deign to take me back.
   1200831|00000000||The contraption and mutagens I leave here. Let them wither and crumble - as did my dreams of regaining my son.
   1195441|00000000||Eh?
   1195443|00000000||Shit!
   1195445|00000000||I'll tear your balls off!
   1195447|00000000||Warlock!
   1055372|ad41ad88||Alghoul
   1156815|00000000||Welcome, wanderer. In need of herbs, perhaps? Wort for a sore stomach or…
   1182567|00000000||Prefer willow bark or iris root for stomach aches. Wort can cause dizziness, nausea.
   1182569|00000000||Forgive me. It's just that you do not have the look of one familiar with herbs.
   1182571|00000000||What look's that? And looks deceive, anyway. Me, I'm not out for common weeds that grow in any meadow. Need rare ingredients. Can you help me out? Or should I move on?
   1182573|00000000||You must judge for yourself.
   1156828|00000000||Right, show me what you got?
   1156818|00000000||Show me what you have.
   1156826|00000000||I'm off. See you later.
   1156820|00000000||See you later.
   1156819|00000000||Meant no offense.
   1156822|00000000||Meant no offense.
   1156824|00000000||And I took none. I should be the one to apologize - for judging by appearance alone. Tell me - your knowledge, how did you gain it? From an herbalist living nearby?
   1182586|00000000||No. From somewhere a long way off. Kaer Morhen. Northern Kaedwen.
   1182588|00000000||Gods… That's the continent's other end! What are you doing in Toussaint?
   1182590|00000000||Same thing I do anywhere. Killing monsters.
   1156817|00000000||Lo and behold, my herb aficionado. Here to buy?
   1171752|00000000||Wiiiiiiiiitcher!!
   1171750|00000000||Too good to drink with me? With me?!
   1193370|00000000||For the witcher's a jolly good fellow - and so says our duchess dear!
   1171754|00000000||There is a house in Fox Hollow… they call the Rising Sun!
   1171756|00000000||Ducal Guard's full of finks! Now worry not and drink, drink, drink!
   1201520|00000000||I met my most loyal lovers over a glass of Butcher of Blaviken!
   1126955|00000000||I had been waiting long for that, freak. Now you've gotten what you deserved.
   1160133|00000000||Not done yet…
   1137563|00000000||Leave him, Geralt. He's not worth it. And we've come here for an altogether different reason.
   1160135|00000000||We shall meet again, mutant.
   1126957|00000000||Three nothing, Tailles. Might wanna give some serious thought to whether you want to face me for a fourth.
   1137559|00000000||I shall kill you, freak!
   1137561|00000000||You got your chance, sir. You failed to seize it and now you must leave.
   1160166|00000000||We shall meet again, mutant!
   1160091|00000000||Had to abandon your mother's camp back then because someone else needed my help, badly. Couldn't refuse them, didn't want to, in fact.
   1160093|00000000||Bah. You mean to say, you had a secret mission, set off to accomplish it, having vowed to tell no one of its nature until you did?
   1160095|00000000||Something like that. Minus the vow. And uh… I'd still rather not divulge the nature of my… secret mission. Can you accept that as justification?
   1160097|00000000||In agreeing to duel, you proved yourself a true knight. Thus I accept your word as that of a man of honor.
   1160099|00000000||Glad to hear it. Now I got work to do.
   1126648|00000000||The gods have seen fit to punish you for your cowardice.
   1137357|00000000||Yadda, yadda - you won, whatever. Now lemme explain something.
   1160089|00000000||For reasons unknown except to them, the gods have chosen to punish me with defeat. But do not think your cowardice will be forgotten.
   1126638|00000000||Dammit, you still going on about that?
   1126640|00000000||Need to clear this up once and for all.
   1126577|00000000||May the blood I will spill wash away the stain of your cowardice.
   1131993|00000000||Let's get this over with. Quick.
   1179138|00000000||Three… two… one.
   1181272|00000000||Why don't you give my third hand a firm shake?!
   1181274|00000000||Up for a mugsmack?
   1181278|00000000||Oh, do I ever ache for a lass…
   1181276|00000000||I've much too much tea in my bags…
   1135546|00000000||In the end, Geralt let his temper boil over and spew forth on Giacomo Cianfanelli, the bank's owner. With fury evident on his knitted brow and waving fists, Geralt went to work on the bank's guards and thus became a persona very much non grata in that establishment.<br>
   1152253|00000000||One day, an old acquaintance ran into Geralt and pulled him aside for a chat. He was a vineyard owner for whom Geralt had completed a contract some time ago. The man had been bereft of adequate coin at the time, but, determined to compensate Geralt fairly one day, he had set up a savings account in the witcher's name at the local bank. Now that years' worth of interest had accrued and Geralt had returned to the duchy, he needed only go to the bank and collect his due.<br>
   1152254|00000000||After a long bout of trench warfare against the bank's bureaucracy, Geralt finally reached the bank's owner, Giacomo Cianfanelli. Unfortunately, Giacomo was suffering a small liquidity crisis in regards to Geralt's funds. Geralt decided to take a risk and wait a week, but only on condition that he would not have to procure any additional documents.<br>
   1152255|00000000||The witcher's visit to Cianfanelli Bank ended in a very witcher-like fashion. Geralt pummeled the guards who tried to restrain him, fought his way to the owner and in clear, concise terms made it clear he would not tolerate any more delays. He collected as much coin as he could and ended up with the dubious honor of finding himself on the list of clients no longer welcome in the bank.<br>
   1106099|00000000||Cianfanelli kept his word and not only gave the witcher his coin, but threw in a present as a bonus -- an old family heirloom. It seems the banker meant what his employees were forced to repeat ad nauseam: with him, the customer is always right and he looks after others' coin as if it were his own.<br>
   1098005|00000000||Go to the Cianfanelli Bank.
   1098006|00000000||Talk to the bank clerk about your account.
   1098007|00000000||Obtain an A38 Permit from Window 1.
   1098011|00000000||Follow Cianfanelli into the vault.
   1107930|00000000||Retrieve your coin.
   1108213|00000000||Return to Window 1 to get Form 202.
   1135479|00000000||Defeat the guards.
   1124105|00000000||Sit and wait until the break ends.
   1124550|00000000||Using your Witcher Senses, find the clerk from Window 1.
   1135328|00000000||[Optional] Ask where to get an A38 Permit.
   1135478|00000000||Ask in the archives about an A38 Permit.
   1152252|00000000||Convince Cianfanelli to pay you your coin.
   1170526|00000000||Get out of the vault.
   1170527|00000000||Talk to Cianfanelli.
   1170610|00000000||Talk to Cianfanelli about your coin.
   1180807|00000000||Defeat the angry bank customer.
   1201802|00000000||[Optional] Buy a present for the bank clerk.
   1201803|00000000||Ask in records about an A38 Permit.
   1207953|00000000||Deal with the vampires attacking the city.
   1170609|00000000||Wait a week and talk to Cianfanelli.
   1208646|00000000||Wait for the bank to open.

   1202270|00000000||The gods protect Her Illustrious Grace.
   1202272|00000000||To serve Her Illustrious Highness is an honor, a privilege, a pleasure.
   1207300|00000000||Honor! Perish, harlotsbroods!
   1207302|00000000||I will fell you all, or my name is not Milton de Peyrac-Peyran!
   1207304|00000000||For the glory of Her Grace! I shall make mincemeat of you!
   1202267|00000000||I will fell you all, or my name is not Milton de Peyrac-Peyran!
   1202269|00000000||For the glory of Her Grace! I shall make pâté of you!

   1186036|00000000||Sir Geralt of Rivia! Three cheers for the tourney's victor! Hip-hip hooray-hooray-hooray!
   1186038|00000000||Sir Ravix of Fourhorn! Three cheers for the tourney's victor! Hip-hip hooray-hooray-hooray!
   1186032|00000000||To be born in Toussaint is to be born under a lucky star.
   1186034|00000000||I'm my own master with a bottle in front of me. It's no disaster, not like a frontal lobotomy!
   1192961|00000000||The word is that witcher - you know, Her Grace's chum - posed for a painting… gearless, no less!
   1192959|00000000||Agh, during the tourney, one knight got stuck in his armor, so bent out of shape it was from repeated blows of a flail. A whole team of smiths worked half a day to get him out - but the poor chap died on them.
   1186041|00000000||You cannot be-- You're not serious, are you?
   1186045|00000000||Excuse me.
   1186039|00000000||My warmest greetings.
   1192964|00000000||That's an eye-opener!
   1192966|00000000||Yes, yes. Of course. Obviously.
   1186043|00000000||Hey! Excuse me!
   1186772|00000000||Damsels demand tenderness! Vehemently!
   1186770|00000000||Wenches will be wenches!
   1186774|00000000||Ah, one could easily fall in love here if one let one's guard down!
   1186776|00000000||Beauclair maids are wooed with ease, yet every last one is free of disease!

   1187234|117ce400||Grottore
   1189812|00000000||Gotta find a way inside.
   1189820|00000000||Great little concealed cubby. No ordinary folk could ever reach it.
   1201290|00000000||Another tale of a life compromised and ultimately claimed by greed and ambition.
   1201334|00000000||Damn. Tortured him.
   1201426|00000000||Must be de Launay's residence.
   1201428|00000000||Bandit camp de Launay wrote about, gotta be.
   1201430|00000000||Need to look around.
   1201294|00000000||Every witcher's felt it - the urge to drop it all and ride off into the sunset.
   1206875|00000000||This one decided to act on the urge. Costs be damned.
   1205664|00000000||Diagrams have a sad history, but I'll make good use of them.
   1205662|00000000||No one lives there anymore. Might still find some clues, though.
   1205660|00000000||Pits of Brume, hm. Strange name for a series of caverns. Should investigate.
   1205658|00000000||Wonder if the bandits got the treasure out of the cave.
   1201292|00000000||Witcher and armorer - both had shit luck.
   1177706|00000000||What a bountiful season! We must order more barrels!
   1177704|00000000||I've not seen a bumper crop like this in ages…
   1177710|00000000||Welcome!
   1177708|00000000||Greetings!
   1177712|00000000||Hey! Try to be more careful!
   1198857|00000000||I would share some choice words about Vermentino, but I would rather not burn my tongue.
   1177714|00000000||Such jests are not appreciated!
   1198859|00000000||When I think of those Coronata swindlers, I can barely choke back the bile!
   1198861|00000000||You're a witcher, right? Help us, you must! Monsters in the field ahead!
   1198863|00000000||Lebioda's wounds! Witcher! Monsters, there!
   1198865|00000000||Thanks! I thank you!
   1172882|00000000||It looked gold to me!
   1172884|00000000||You twit! Get back in the boat!
   1172785|00000000||That's not it at all! It was to be golden!
   1172787|00000000||Do you think I don't know that?!
   1172886|00000000||Never worry, dearest.
   1172888|00000000||I'm not. We shall soon hook another.
   1125950|0ab75c3f||Guy de Bois-Fresnes
   1186894|00000000||Don't rush about so…
   1186892|00000000||Cheers.
   1186898|00000000||Diddle me, knock something back and wipe that frightening grimace off your face!
   1186896|00000000||You shan't turn back a river with a rod! Sit, drink…
   1201470|00000000||I trust no one who claims to love wine but has not tasted Geralt of Rivia.
   1178527|00000000||You need new britches? Gauntlets, perhaps? What say you, fair knight?
   1156154|00000000||Need something crafted. You willing?
   1156148|00000000||Could you craft something for me?
   1211270|00000000||Seem an expert. Got some diagrams - interest you, maybe?
   1211273|00000000||Hm, indeed, indeed, they do!
   1211275|00000000||Save, I fear I simply don't understand them.
   1211277|00000000||Know anyone who might manage to decipher them?
   1211279|00000000||I'd advise you to see Lazare Lafargue. You will find him near the Metinna Gate. The man takes to the obscure with zeal.
   1211268|00000000||Found some interesting diagrams…
   1188498|00000000||Up for a round of gwent?
   1188496|00000000||Whaddaya say we play gwent?
   1156160|00000000||So long.
   1156150|00000000||Take care.
   1156147|00000000||Show me your wares.
   1156152|00000000||Hm, what've you got there?
   1156146|00000000||The best armor around! That is what I forge! Ah, so sorry.
   1207218|00000000||They're done, at last.
   1207220|00000000||Unworthy. Entirely inappropriate behavior.
   1207222|00000000||A complete collapse of social norms.
   1207212|00000000||Fisticuffs? But why?
   1207214|00000000||That peasant broke the rules.
   1207216|00000000||Who ever let him in?
   1169565|00000000||Sorry, gotta get through.
   1169567|00000000||Hold, there! What is this?! Back of the queue, sir!
   1169571|00000000||What're you gonna do about it?
   1169578|00000000||Mh. Well, couldn't really give a crap.
   1169580|00000000||You boor, you churl!
   1173440|00000000||I will not stand for this! Just you wait, I'll teach you some manners…
   1173442|00000000||Go on. Hit me.
   1178918|00000000||Ho, gentlemen! If you wish to raise a ruckus, do it outside!
   1201508|00000000||Outside! Now!
   1169574|00000000||Did no such thing. Been standing here the whole time.
   1169576|00000000||Is that so? You know you're the third today to try that ruse?!
   1169570|00000000||Nope. Been here all along.
   1169569|00000000||You cut in front of me, sir…
   1169589|00000000||Argh, closed…
   1169591|00000000||They've got their break, now. Wait with the rest of us.
   1169892|00000000||That'll do, sir! Jumping the queue?! How dare you?!
   1173393|00000000||Uncouth petty bourgeois… Cuts in line, then resorts to fisticuffs…
   1173397|00000000||Next time, mind your place, you churl!
   1189840|00000000||The bodies… Seems they were running for the exit.
   1201343|00000000||They were scholars - should've guessed the passages inside were blocked for a reason.
   1205633|00000000||Good thing they didn't try to go in there without a witcher.
   1201405|00000000||Scholars pitched camp here. Should look around.
   1201407|00000000||Magic barrier. Got a bad feeling, dammit.
   1204863|00000000||A witcher. Brought the ceiling down to bury his foes. Ended up burying himself, too.
   1204868|00000000||Satchel looks like it belonged to a witcher.
   1205639|00000000||Too bad things ended here for this Wolf. Not many of us left alive.
   1201345|00000000||Adon came to Toussaint at Vesemir's request. Interesting.
   1194424|00000000||Careful with them paws!
   1194426|00000000||Grimy churls.
   1184843|00000000||Why don't you carry a shield, sir?
   1184841|00000000||Are you a knight?
   1170772|00000000||Man… Bled to death. Big beast inflicted these wounds. Clear from the claw marks. Must have a toothy smile, too, judging by what ripped his throat open.
   1170774|00000000||Signs of a fight. Paw prints. Beastly ones - that's clear. Just on this spot, though. Hm, aerial attack, must've been.
   1170776|00000000||Blood. Of the fresh variety. Monster attack was recent.
   1186472|00000000||Says "Great White Terror" on the contract. Could be the same damn beast as in the notice, though.
   1174397|00000000||Camp's abandoned, but a lot of this damage is recent. Guess I arrived just a little too late. Should look around, still.
   1170780|00000000||Draconid, gotta be. Maybe a basilisk? Except… these prints don't belong to any variety I know. Just a liiiitle different.
   1206920|00000000||Should scour the local notice boards. Someone might've posted a contract for whatever lives here.
   1206918|00000000||Belongs to one big beast, this. Gotta be winged, given there's no paw prints. No scraps of humans, either. Interesting.
   1176133|00000000||Wh-wh-what are you doing?
   1176135|00000000||Boor! Pa-parvenu!
   1176139|00000000||Gree-greetings, witcher.
   1176137|00000000||G-g-g-g-ood day!
   1198867|00000000||You scattered all the hanses! Be praised, witcher!
   1176141|00000000||Th-the Guard must disband the va-vandaguilds. Or a witcher could do it!
   1176143|00000000||If n-no one b-breaks up the hanses, there will be t-trouble exporting wine.
   1144485|00000000||That's a good lad.
   1144487|00000000||Ptooey, blast, ptooey!
   1144489|00000000||My grandmother hits harder than that!
   1144491|00000000||I'll make your bum a trumpet!
   1144493|00000000||Nipping at my heels, wolfie?
   1144495|00000000||Very well. Time for a lesson in law and justice…
   1144497|00000000||Ooh, no, no, no! Put it away!
   1144499|00000000||Thrash him, boys!
   1144501|00000000||You! What the devil are you doing?!
   1192825|00000000||The duquessa's dead, a terrible tragedy… But order in the duchy must be maintained.
   1144505|00000000||Nothing to see here! Move along!
   1144503|00000000||Don't crowd around.
   1144507|00000000||Magic!
   1144509|00000000||Hurraaaah!
   1144511|00000000||Now you're kerflooeyed…
   1144515|00000000||How are things?
   1144513|00000000||Witcher?
   1161066|00000000||Her Enlightened Highness truly requires your aid.
   1185468|00000000||Dump it out your rump and fart to finish!
   1198595|00000000||So the witcher came to Monsieur de Bourbeau and said, "I've good news and bad news. The good news is I killed the monster that dwelt beneath your vineyard. The bad news is…"
   1198597|00000000||"…Your wife was diddling a farmhand!"
   1198599|00000000||That witcher from the North - he's here for good! The duchess gave him a vineyard for his service to the duchy!
   1198593|00000000||Have you heard about Sir Maximus Macrinus? Fourfingers' hanse murdered his whole family! Then crucified him on the gates of his vineyard!
   1198601|00000000||Truly? I find that hard to believe…
   1198603|00000000||What's that to do with me?
   1185476|00000000||Witcher! You freed us from the Beast - perhaps you might free me from my old ball and chain?
   1185472|00000000||I've this burning, stabbing sensation in my ribs…
   1185474|00000000||So that is who Her Grace summoned from the North…
   1185470|00000000||Geralt of Rivia, our hero!
   1185482|00000000||Ow, that hurts! What is it?
   1185478|00000000||Lebioda shower you with warmth!
   1185480|00000000||What's got you so excited?
   1180924|00000000||What… what are you doing?
   1180930|00000000||Wait one moment. You, sir, are the tourney's champion!
   1180932|00000000||The honorable Sir Ravix of Fourhorn! Accept my most sincere congratulations!
   1180928|00000000||{Ess'deireadh tùrnment y ess’creasa vor caer.} [This tourney must end, so we can go home.]
   1180926|00000000||{Esse’ionndrainn aep me weddin…} [I miss my children…]
   1180934|00000000||Watch it! Or I will--!
   1180938|00000000||{Ehh… Squess me.} [Errr. I beg your pardon.]
   1180936|00000000||Greetings.
   1165392|00000000||I don't work with witchers!
   1165390|00000000||You've got a headache, a toothache and a cock ache, as I see it!
   1165394|00000000||Times are tough, coin is tight, pay up front or no love tonight!
   1165396|00000000||Ugh, my belly's roiling…
   1161671|00000000||That's an outrage!
   1161673|00000000||Bad form, sir!
   1161675|00000000||Do something!
   1161677|00000000||Do what, exactly? Am I to jump in the water?
   1161679|00000000||Lodge an official protest!
   1161661|00000000||What the blazes?!
   1161663|00000000||Did someone just dive in the water?!
   1161665|00000000||Perhaps that's the way to do it?
   1161667|00000000||Sure, if you're a peasant.
   1161654|00000000||My, he's brave!
   1161656|00000000||Swim on, good man!
   1161650|00000000||Oh!
   1161652|00000000||I feel faint…
   1161646|00000000||Look!
   1161648|00000000||Scandalous!
   1161642|00000000||Is that not counter to the rules?!
   1161644|00000000||Who is that man?!
   1161699|00000000||That is not allowed!
   1161701|00000000||It will not do!
   1161695|00000000||What a scoundrel!
   1161697|00000000||Mmm-hm. But my is he manly.
   1198163|00000000||I love when all the courtiers get to mingle.
   1198165|00000000||So many new faces… Ooh la la.
   1198167|00000000||You take the high road, and I'll take the low road,
   1198169|00000000||And I'll be in Beauclair before you.
   1199395|00000000||But me and my true love shall never meet again,
   1199397|00000000||On the vine-covered slopes of Mount Gorgon.
   1198171|00000000||Hehehehe… O captain, my captain!
   1198173|00000000||You embarrass me, dear.
   1198175|00000000||As fable holds, the golden fish grants wishes.
   1199390|00000000||What, uh, would you suggest I request when I catch it?
   1198177|00000000||I shall tell you later, whisper it in your ear, tee hee hee!
   1043714|ca37d28d||Silvan
   1196315|00000000||Yeah.
   1196317|00000000||Heh, heh, heh heh, heeeh.
   1196319|00000000||Ah, horrible times!
   1196321|00000000||People! An affray!
   1182467|00000000||What's all this then?!
   1182475|00000000||I was in the middle of a round of gwent when the vampires attacked! And I had drawn such good cards…
   1182473|00000000||A lucky break - that's the only reason you won the gwent tourney!
   1182469|00000000||That gwent will be the end of me… I lost again…
   1182471|00000000||I wonder if I can get a loan from Cianfanelli… And if I were to put up my wife as surety?
   1182477|00000000||Careful, good folk!
   1182481|00000000||Huh…?
   1182479|00000000||Yes…? Oh, welcome!
   1166873|00000000||Kinda regret not risking it, now, not playing you for the sword.
   1166875|00000000||A well-deserved victory - congratulate I you.
   1209376|00000000||Glad I came here unarmed. Might've been tempted to raise the stakes, then lost big.
   1209378|00000000||Whereas for this reason selfsame, disappointed I am somewhat.
   1166877|00000000||Dammit. Not just out of the tournament, lost my sword, too.
   1166879|00000000||Thus in life goes it ever, one's fortune another's misfortune requires. For a match good, thank I you.
   1166881|00000000||Congratulations. Lucky I didn't bet my sword.
   1166883|00000000||A good match. Thank I you.
   1209372|00000000||Kinda regret coming unarmed, now.
   1209374|00000000||Offer I did…
   1188396|00000000||I am honored.
   1166893|00000000||With round one completed, the standings are as follows. Agnetha Skold and Eric van Vrog - both disqualified. Geralt of Rivia has defeated Hamal ogn Dangbahli of Ofier. In the semifinal, Geralt shall face the defending champion, Ambassador von Hinn!
   1188394|00000000||With round one completed, the standings are as follows. Geralt of Rivia - eliminated. Agnetha Skold and Eric von Vrog - both disqualified. Consequently, His Excellency the Ambassador of Nilfgaard shall now face Hamal ogn Dangbahli.
   1166891|00000000||As gwent is a gentleman's sport, we expect all its players to demonstrate impeccable manners, and we cannot tolerate any disturbances.
   1200053|00000000||Thus, by decision of Count Monnier, the contestants from Novigrad and Skellige are hereby disqualified.
   1169005|00000000||Gentleman's sport - bah! Well, I'm a lady. And we ladies don't give a flyin' fart about a tourney where any measly prick can accuse us of cheatin'!
   1166885|00000000||I'd never have lost if you hadn't cheated!
   1166887|00000000||In my land, folk who slander like that don't live long! 'Cause we don't let 'em!
   1169002|00000000||Accuse me of cheatin' again, and I'll cut yer tongue out.
   1166889|00000000||Enough! Hands to yourselves!
   1166869|00000000||Good match. Thanks.
   1166871|00000000||And upon your victory, congratulate I you. What drove me to wager a sword against you, know I not. Clearly to guide me the Universe ceased.
   1200051|00000000||Here, you may it serve well.
   1206936|00000000||Far be it from me to criticize your modus operandi, but… the searching, it took quite some time. Ah, I suppose we shall have to wait for the right light once we arrive.
   1100953|00000000||Painting this masterpiece gonna take long?
   1100955|00000000||A mere six hours. The sun won't allow us to work any longer than that. Oh, but the time will fly by! We'll chat, swap tales…
   1100957|00000000||Better yet, lemme down a potion. Time'll definitely fly by in a state of lethargy. And no need to swap tales.
   1100959|00000000||No, no, no! Your expression, your posture - they must be just so! You must look alive, with fire in your gaze! Lethargy is out of the question!
   1100961|00000000||Come on, give it some thought. You could title the painting "A Witcher Lying Senselessly on the Heath."
   1100963|00000000||You jest. Haha. A jesting witcher.
   1100951|00000000||We have had fantastic luck with the weather. The light is perfect, absolutely perfect!
   1165318|00000000||A feather… broken. There was a fight.
   1165340|00000000||You mean to cross the barbarous Barbarossa? Not on your life!
   1165328|00000000||But why keep her in a cage? Eggs from free range birds are so much better. Ah well. Where's the key?
   1185605|00000000||Outdated. Already freed the goose.
   1165314|00000000||Hmm. Doesn't seem to be at home.
   1165316|00000000||Perhaps she left some tracks behind? Go on, use those kitty-cat eyes.
   1165320|00000000||Goose feathers… must've been flapping its wings. Or did it just get plucked?
   1184190|00000000||Honk honk honk honk!
   1166055|00000000||Legs? In ruby red slippers?
   1168182|00000000||From a tale about a wizard from Ofier. You might not know it.
   1165310|00000000||Contract from a goose. That's new.
   1165312|00000000||Do you really aim to concern yourself with that?
   1166133|00000000||A true witcher should never abandon poultry in distress.
   1166135|00000000||Honk honk honk honk!
   1165362|00000000||You're welcome.
   1165364|00000000||Honk honk honk honk!
   1166065|00000000||Would've preferred a magic bean, but not about to complain.
   1165360|00000000||Look! She laid a golden egg for you! Haha!
   1167222|00000000||Heh. If only all my employers were that generous…
   1165344|00000000||Good thing you posted that notice. Never would've found you, otherwise.
   1165346|00000000||Honk honk honk honk!
   1165322|00000000||Hey, there, in the trees! Some kind of camp?
   1165330|00000000||Here it is. Got it.
   1165324|00000000||Defend the goose! The golden eggs will be ours!
   1165326|00000000||The goose is ours! Her golden eggs as well!
   1195206|00000000||Let me see! Come, now, papa!
   1195208|00000000||One moment.
   1195210|00000000||But you promised! I'll tell mama!
   1195212|00000000||Just a minute.
   1187911|00000000||This moonlight makes me oh so dreamy.
   1187913|00000000||Penny for your thoughts. Lemme guess - succubus twins?
   1187915|00000000||No. I was thinking about… oh, how anything can look interesting when properly lit.
   1187917|00000000||Even an old necrophage corpse?
   1188983|00000000||You've not an ounce of refinement in you, have you?
   1195019|00000000||Ahoy!
   1195021|00000000||Well, what's new?
   1195017|00000000||A thousand thunderin' sea devils!
   1195015|00000000||Argh, to hell with it!
   1195023|00000000||Ye whale dick!
   1195025|00000000||Hahahahaha!
   1195027|00000000||Help, me hearties!
   1186940|00000000||Hey, Edgar… Are the rumors true? Are there elven ruins somewhere in the woods?
   1195488|00000000||I doubt it, myself. But the wife, she went berry-picking once. Came back to say she'd seen walls 'midst the trees.
   1195490|00000000||And? Did she not go back to rummage? See if there was treasure to be had?
   1195492|00000000||No. I told her - there might be treasure, there might not be. Monsters, though, there'd be for certain. Best not venture close.
   1186075|00000000||Will you stay with us, witcher? Now that you've a vineyard?
   1186077|00000000||Hey! Geralt! All the best!
   1186071|00000000||That witcher's rather handsome.
   1186073|00000000||The duchess summoned him… I wonder what for.
   1192972|00000000||The noises at the cemetery… it's thieves ripping caskets from the ground, I'm sure. You only hear them at night, because they're scared of the Guard!
   1192974|00000000||You hear? The Ardaiso quarry's cursed. Cows fall upon it from the sky!
   1192970|00000000||The blacksmith's wife, she's always showing off their costlies. Yet I hear they bought it all with loans from Cianfanelli…
   1186081|00000000||Are you mad?!
   1186085|00000000||Hey there!
   1186079|00000000||Hullo!
   1192976|00000000||Lebioda's wounds…
   1192978|00000000||Who the devil knows? Perhaps it's true.
   1186083|00000000||Hey! You gray-haired chit!
   1193418|00000000||Hullo!
   1193420|00000000||Hmmm… Hm hm.
   1193422|00000000||Ah! Oh, help!
   1214430|00000000||Someone willing to pay me for resolving the problem?
   1097762|00000000||Not a soul. Strange.
   1112248|00000000||Doesn't look anything like a grave hag's lair, either.
   1096337|00000000||"Here lies Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María…" - yeah, that's not it.
   1209404|00000000||Hmm, noises started right around then.
   1096266|00000000||Louis de Corentin - "…died on the day of Saint Zoatham's Remembrance."
   1113951|00000000||All right. Gotta move one of them out.
   1096275|00000000||"Louis de Corentin. Raise your sighs to the Prophet Lebioda on his behalf."
   1096264|00000000||Pretty fresh. Funeral wasn't too long ago.
   1096268|00000000||"Here lies Margot de Corentin."
   1096260|00000000||Smashed. As if someone threw it against the wall.
   1096262|00000000||Hmm. Gold. Can't be grave robbers. None worth their salt would've left this.
   1096335|00000000||"Sir Conan of Braye End. Died of over titillation while witnessing an act of unicornipositusphilia." Interesting - but not what I'm looking for.
   1160537|00000000||Noise is clearly coming from that tomb. Impossible.
   1160541|00000000||Hm, something's not right. Need to hide, see how things play out…
   1179554|00000000||Right, dark now. Where could I hide…?
   1179556|00000000||Behind this statue, maybe…?
   1185984|00000000||I agree completely, young man - loess is clearly more adhesive than loam.
   1185986|00000000||Isn't that the truth! I noticed it myself. But clay, now that's a real pickle to clean off!
   1194746|00000000||Greetings.
   1194748|00000000||He's a horny one!
   1194752|00000000||I didn't do anything!
   1187009|00000000||And verily I say unto you, if men were but to let the Prophet Lebioda's teachings into their hearts, this world would be a more pleasing place.
   1196405|00000000||Thus raise your voices with mine - O Prophet Lebioda!
   1196407|00000000||O Prophet Lebioda…
   1196409|00000000||O Prophet Lebioda…
   1196411|00000000||I swear to live according to thy teachings.
   1196413|00000000||I swear to live according to thy teachings.
   1196415|00000000||And never to stray from the straight and narrow path which thou hast wrought for us.
   1196417|00000000||And never to stray from the straight and narrow path which thou hast wrought for us.
   1163022|00000000||Agh, dammit. Sure you left them here?
   1163024|00000000||Yes, right there! I'd prepared everything. Set it out, ordered and organized.
   1163026|00000000||Hmm, might've toppled downhill or something. Fine, I'll take a look around.
   1162972|00000000||Fine. I'll look around.
   1163119|00000000||Ugh. Really don't feel like it. You asked me to pose, not… investigate. Sorry, but I refuse to go looking for your paints.
   1163121|00000000||Do you mean that? Witcher, don't do this to me. I don't deserve this, it's-- it's not my fault. They were here, I swear, they--
   1163123|00000000||Next time, make sure you're prepared before you bother a witcher about something like this.
   1162978|00000000||Waste of time. Not about to go looking.
   1162973|00000000||Can't you use different paints?
   1163036|00000000||Wouldn't happen to have another set with you?
   1163056|00000000||And, uh, nothing you could use instead?
   1163052|00000000||My word! Would you really have me scrawl with charcoal like an animal?
   1161145|00000000||Ladies, gentlemen, my lieges… Forgive me for being forward… but have you perchance seen a set of paints and brushes nearby?
   1161147|00000000||Eugenie… I believe this peasant wants something from us.
   1161149|00000000||My paints, my brushes… I had prepared them, they-they were here.
   1161151|00000000||We've not seen any journeyman's tools, my good man. Of that I assure you.
   1161153|00000000||There a problem?
   1161155|00000000||Yes! An immense one! I cannot possibly paint without my… paints! I'm done for! Unless… you would be kind enough to locate them?
   1182332|00000000||I heard some Nordling drove off the Beast. This was you, yes?
   1182334|00000000||Strange land, yes, Nordling? One that cuts down its own heroes…
   1182330|00000000||{Esse liuet fear aep caer…} [So far from home…]
   1182328|00000000||{Ech, Toussentien esse liuet ferranch…} [Ehh, these Toussaintlies really rile me…]
   1182336|00000000||{Quess'aen a va?!} [What are you doing?!]
   1182338|00000000||You! Watch it!
   1182342|00000000||How go things, Nordling?
   1182340|00000000||{Que?} [What?]
   1156717|00000000||Your Grace… this might not be the best idea.
   1156719|00000000||I've made my decision. Prepare to depart.
   1170799|00000000||Geralt of Rivia, master witcher.
   1170802|00000000||I was not mistaken. You arrived and trouble followed soon after.
   1170809|00000000||Step aside. Got a matter for the duchess.
   1170812|00000000||At last, witcher. We've been on tenterhooks! Did you catch Milton's killer?
   1170795|00000000||Case is more serious than we thought. The Beast - I couldn't kill it, didn't manage.
   1170797|00000000||Case just got more complicated.
   1170796|00000000||Found the Beast. But that's it.
   1170814|00000000||Found the "Beast of Beauclair." Just couldn't kill it.
   1179215|00000000||We send you after a monster, and you return with nothing? We are very disappointed.
   1179217|00000000||Situation's not quite that simple. Beast's a powerful vampire.
   1179219|00000000||Pfff, is this a problem? Is it too much for a witcher? A monster slayer?  But everyone knows how to end a vampire. Draw him by trick into sunlight. Or arm yourself with ample garlic and drive a stake through its heart.
   1179221|00000000||Garlic's useless against vampires. Sun and stakes don't hurt 'em, either. Those methods - pure invention, only work in legends and fables.
   1179330|00000000||And buckthorn? When I was a child, grandmama Ademarta always claimed buckthorn drives off vampires.
   1179332|00000000||Silver sword's your best option for keeping them at bay. But it won't get the job done - 'cause only a higher vampire can truly kill another of its kind.
   1179227|00000000||Excuses… Your Grace, I shall assemble a battue, bring the matter to its end at once. The witcher need but tell us where to find this monster.
   1170863|00000000||Go ahead, send them to their death. Certain death.
   1170865|00000000||To a lone witcher, perhaps. To forty of my men at arms, but another skirmish.
   1170857|00000000||Go ahead. Let 'em go to their deaths.
   1170856|00000000||Stay out of this.
   1170859|00000000||Whoa, this is work for a witcher, not for your guardsmen.
   1170861|00000000||Yet when a witcher fails, my guardsmen must step in. I'll take my best - forty hardened veterans. No vampire can stand up to that.
   1179334|00000000||Forty, fifty, a hundred - doesn't matter. Won't make any difference against him.
   1179336|00000000||You have not seen my guardsmen in action.
   1179338|00000000||Can they fight fog? Hit a target that moves faster than the wind?
   1179341|00000000||How… what creature can do such things?
   1179343|00000000||Creatures like this one. Higher vampires, we call them. Each one's a little different… unique or exceptional, you might say.
   1179422|00000000||Some transform into giant bats, others communicate with animals, command them.
   1179345|00000000||Yet all are still brainless beasts.
   1179424|00000000||Dead wrong. Thinking of lesser vampires - alps, ekimmaras, katakans, for instance. They're ruled by instinct, sure. Attack anything that smells of blood. Higher vampires? They think. They employ reason.
   1179595|00000000||Monsters driven by reason… A curious contention. What, then, do you intend to do?
   1170932|00000000||We all await. You are holding things up. May we depart for Castel Ravello?
   1170934|00000000||Yeah, ready to go.
   1202759|00000000||Excellent. Give me a moment - I must don something more appropriate and concealing. Then we will be off.
   1170925|00000000||Let's go.
   1170936|00000000||Need more time.
   1170938|00000000||Make haste! Time is of the essence…
   1170926|00000000||Need some time.
   1199768|00000000||Your Grace, what you propose is far too dangerous. The witcher should go alone…
   1170920|00000000||It pleases me to see you gentlemen finally agree on something, but I've made my decision.
   1199770|00000000||We shall go, accompanied by the best possible escorts - you, captain, and Geralt.
   1171833|00000000||We will travel incognito. We've no wish to give the court any reason to gossip…
   1170922|00000000||For the duration of this mission I release you from your obligation to adhere to court protocol. In short, from now on I am Anna Henrietta, not Your Grace.
   1170924|00000000||Yes, Your Grace! Errr. Witcher, are you ready?
   1170912|00000000||Wait… Your Grace wants to go with me? Out of the question.
   1170914|00000000||I hope you do not suppose we will sit on our ducal hiney and do nothing while our duchy is in grave danger?
   1170909|00000000||What do you mean, "we"?
   1170910|00000000||This specific wine - tell me more.
   1180628|00000000||Sangreal - never heard of it.
   1180630|00000000||It's highly unlikely you've ever had a chance to partake of it. As I said, it is only ever served to the ducal family.
   1180634|00000000||Didn't stop it from ending up on that scrap of paper… unless, Your Grace's sommelier is mistaken.
   1180636|00000000||In matters of wine, Benoit is never mistaken. If he says it's Sangreal, it is Sangreal.
   1180638|00000000||We must ride to Castel Ravello at once, discover what has happened.
   1194177|00000000||Hmm… I admit to being swayed, witcher. You may be right… Do you know anything about the blackmailer?
   1194180|00000000||Got one lead - a few scraps of paper. Blackmailer wrote the names of the vampire's victims on them.
   1194182|00000000||One of them's stained - a drop of wine, looks like… So damn little to go on.
   1194184|00000000||You've no idea how wrong you are, my dear. Send for the ducal sommelier! Hop, hop!
   1194187|00000000||In Toussaint, wine is sacred. Here there is no such thing as "a drop of wine" or stains therefrom. They are stains from a drop of Est Est, Erveluce, Fiorano…
   1194190|00000000||Your Grace wished to see me?
   1194192|00000000||Witcher, show him the paper scrap.
   1194194|00000000||Benoit, can you determine which wine made this stain?
   1194197|00000000||Mhm… mm, yes, yes… The west bank of the Sansretour, that's rather obvious. Aged in barrels of Beauclair oak… Hue - deep burgundy, clarity - high…
   1194199|00000000||It's simple. Sangreal. The 1269 vintage.
   1194201|00000000||That's… That's impossible. The wine is produced at Castel Ravello. Especially and exclusively for the ducal table…
   1194203|00000000||Perhaps some Sangreal was stolen? We must go to the vineyard, see if there's not been an incident.
   1194171|00000000||I'll find the blackmailer, free the vampire's lover.
   1195171|00000000||You were to destroy him, not help him.
   1195177|00000000||No one else should die - that's most important. Soon as the woman's safe, he'll have no more reason to kill.
   1194156|00000000||Free the vampire's lover.
   1194157|00000000||An innocent woman's been abducted.
   1194151|00000000||Which is why that's my aim now - to prevent further attacks.
   1194155|00000000||Vampire's only half the problem. Blackmailer's at fault, chiefly. Kidnapped the woman to control the vampire.
   1194324|00000000||And what do you propose to do?
   1199826|00000000||Try to talk to him - that's our best bet.
   1199828|00000000||I cannot believe this… Her Grace summons a witcher to kill a monster. Instead, he wishes to chat with it!
   1194159|00000000||Know what I'm doing. His lover was kidnapped. He's being blackmailed.
   1194165|00000000||Blackmailed? Be so kind as to explain how a vampire might be blackmailed.
   1194167|00000000||Higher vampires, they're like us - motivated by emotions, not instinct. Not only are they intelligent to an extreme, they're emotionally… rich, capable of feeling many things. Even love.
   1199710|00000000||This one fell in love with a woman, a human. And he'll do anything to keep her from harm.
   1194265|00000000||You do not, I trust, suggest we let Milton's killer go free? Or wait until it murders again? We must render it harmless as quickly as possible.
   1179370|00000000||Wanna find him, try to talk to him.
   1179371|00000000||This is no common "monster."
   1179375|00000000||It's way beyond being some "monster." This is a powerful being that's walked the world for centuries.
   1181609|00000000||Impossible. If so great is their power, why have they not killed or enslaved us all?
   1179377|00000000||Don't usually meddle in our matters. Mostly stay out of our way 'cause they don't care about humans one way or the other.
   1181611|00000000||And they do not fear we shall wipe them out one day?
   1181613|00000000||Huh. They'd probably be pretty amused if you asked them that. They're well aware of their strength.
   1181615|00000000||Then what can we do? Do you have a plan?
   1156677|00000000||Your Grace, I have doubled the guard. The palace is secure.
   1156679|00000000||Mhm… And what of the funeral preparations?
   1156681|00000000||As Your Grace wished, the deceased will be buried with the highest honors.
   1156683|00000000||And our dearly departed Milton de Peyrac-Peyran shall posthumously receive the Order of Ademarta…
   1211169|00000000||Yes? Have you any needs?
   1211167|00000000||My Lord?
   1193514|00000000||Heeheehee!
   1193516|00000000||Achoo!
   1188214|00000000||It's all up to Vivienne.
   1188275|00000000||Doesn't matter what we agreed. It's Vivienne's decision. She can either try it or not.
   1188277|00000000||Of course. But I could not live in the knowledge it was I who brought an ill fate down upon her.
   1128853|00000000||Should try the water method.
   1187279|00000000||Method using a pool of water's better. Poses no threat to Vivienne.
   1188257|00000000||Naturally! You must know you can count on me. I shall bear it all. But Vivienne… I fear she might be too proud to agree to such a thing.
   1189479|00000000||I'll meet her after the last contest. Talk to her. She could agree.
   1187228|00000000||Sorry. Promised her I wouldn't tell.
   1187238|00000000||Vivienne gave me the details of her situation, but she did so in confidence. Promised I wouldn't tell anyone.
   1187240|00000000||But I am not just anyone! Why, I would do anything for her! I was the one to ask you to help her. You cannot shut me out now.
   1187251|00000000||I'm sorry. Look, in time, Vivienne'll come to understand what she owes you, I'm sure of it. But until then, you gotta understand the whole world doesn't revolve around you.
   1188212|00000000||How dare you lecture me! This is not the aid I sought! And to think I gave up my spot in the tourney to you! I regret it, now. Do you even intend to compete to the end?
   1206607|00000000||Or now that you've bound Vivienne to your terms, you no longer see the need?
   1173024|00000000||I don't back out of anything. I'll take part in the last skirmish. Besides, Vivienne'll be busy till the tourney's end.
   1187759|00000000||Indeed. In that case, you must meet the other knights of your team. They await near the arena's entrance, by the training ground.
   1202105|00000000||Got it. Thanks.
   1173021|00000000||Wanna finish the tourney.
   1173026|00000000||Tourney doesn't interest me anymore. I'll wait in the tent until Vivienne's done with all her duties.
   1187761|00000000||As you will.
   1173022|00000000||Backing out of the tourney. Gonna wait for Vivienne's decision.
   1187563|00000000||I'm counting on you, witcher. And I'm content we finally know something. What now? We know all, so you need not see the tourney through. You could withdraw.
   1187757|00000000||True, I shall get an earful from the herald should you fail to show for the last contest… but it's nothing I can't handle. So, what will it be?
   1128865|00000000||Best route? Ritual with the oriole egg. Surest method, won't put any third parties at risk.
   1188256|00000000||Third parties? I am no third party!
   1199916|00000000||Hmm… Lemme talk to her. Could very well appreciate your eagerness, change her mind. But it'll have to be her decision.
   1128854|00000000||Need to perform the egg ritual.
   1188250|00000000||Which method do you believe to be best for Vivienne?
   1188252|00000000||Don't know yet.
   1188254|00000000||But you've some notion, have you not? Do not tell me you seriously consider drastically shortening her life when I stand prepared to shoulder the burden!
   1188279|00000000||You mean… become a bird themselves…?
   1188281|00000000||Theoretically. See, curse grows weaker once it's transferred. Might end up as just an appetite for seeds and worms. All outcomes are on the table, though. Death included.
   1188283|00000000||I am prepared to sacrifice, give my life for her. Just as King Vridank's knight did for the beautiful Queen Cerro!
   1188285|00000000||Knew that already. But are you prepared to swallow bugs for the rest of your life?
   1188287|00000000||… Yes.
   1187255|00000000||Heard of one other method that could work. Curse could be lifted via her reflection, say, in a pool of water.
   1187257|00000000||Thing is, we'd need someone who'd willingly assume the burden of the curse, take it on in her stead.
   1188273|00000000||Tough case. Curse's hold on her grows stronger every day. And I'm a witcher, not a miracle worker.
   1188213|00000000||Spell's complicated.
   1127925|00000000||We were both right, actually. It is a curse. One that's transforming Vivienne into a bird. Her condition's getting worse.
   1127927|00000000||Gods! A curse that is a worse affliction than disease… What now?! Can you help her?
   1187245|00000000||That'll depend on her. I'll try, if she asks me. Significant risks involved, though - shortening her life to about another seven years included.
   1187247|00000000||What?! This is not what we agreed!
   1187229|00000000||A powerful curse afflicts her.
   1127921|00000000||Did you learn anything?
   1127923|00000000||Yeah.
   1187227|00000000||Then speak, man! Can you not see I am out of my mind with worry?! What ails her?!
   1201448|00000000||She asked me not to talk about it.
   1201450|00000000||But I want only the best for her! Perhaps I shall be able to help or… I don't know, console her, at the least.
   1171641|00000000||Blue bridge on a black field, three red diamonds on a white one.
   1171637|00000000||Woman riding a bear, yellow field.
   1171639|00000000||Need to find my tent. Should look around for the one with my crest.
   1104729|ef3c998f||Fire Swallower
   1198459|00000000||It's time I stepped out into the world and wandered. The duquessa's death marks the end here.
   1198461|00000000||Witcher, why did you not take the blow for the duquessa?
   1190451|00000000||Should I break one of my rules once, I am bound to break many more.
   1190449|00000000||A knight is one who does not what he wishes, but what he should do.
   1190457|00000000||You fight well, yet still, you shall perish!
   1190455|00000000||Defend yourself!
   1190453|00000000||Taste my cold steel!
   1190459|00000000||Good deeds are always rewarded.
   1190461|00000000||Peace and prosperity.
   1190463|00000000||That's enough!
   1212181|00000000||The young bootblack whose name Geralt never learned was an extremely charming scamp, in that cheeky, lovable rascal, street urchin sort of way. He also demonstrated striking entrepreneurial flair, so much so, in fact, that it got him into trouble at times. Geralt saved him from one such scrape by fending off a group of men intent on giving him a thorough tanning. The bootblack had done his share to deserve this, having spilled his wastewater in front of their shop every day in an attempt to muddy more boots and drive more customers his way.<br>
   1212182|00000000||Geralt took such a liking to this enterprising little shoeshine boy he decided to invest some coin in his business. He did not have to wait long to see the effects of this investment. The bootblack used these funds to improve his stall and purchase additional equipment. Business was booming!<br>
   1212183|00000000||Geralt’s path crossed that of the bootblack again later on. Once more, the reason had something to do with Dettlaff. The lad was able to tell Geralt and Regis how the letters with the Beast’s victims’ names on them had been delivered to Dettlaff. It can be truly amazing how much useful information one simple child laborer can possess.
   1212180|00000000||Bootblack
   1191379|00000000||Oh boy, oh boy!
   1191381|00000000||Show me your sword?
   1191383|00000000||Hahahahaha!
   1205382|06342f8d||Gueule
   1207166|4b5c4e7e||Slyzards
   1191816|00000000||All right, all right, already… You helped us. Thanks bunches. Happy?
   1191606|00000000||Welcome.
   1191608|00000000||Nice day.
   1191610|00000000||Simpleton!
   1191612|00000000||Don't kill me! I'll pay!
   1187543|42eb3a92||Exhibition Curator
   1173398|ca728647||Silly Bear
   1199131|00000000||Giving you one last chance - yield.
   1199129|00000000||The damned harlot got us into this… Kill him! Attack!
   1176376|00000000||Wasn't expecting to see you two here.
   1176378|00000000||We thought you could use our help, so--
   1176406|00000000||Witcher. This is no time to explain. Where is Rhena?
   1192505|00000000||Expect to answer a lot of questions inside.
   1192507|00000000||Let us go, then.
   1207972|b2d90a41||Matthieu Lessoc
   1028020|381b0ad1||Juggler
   1194526|00000000||Hm?
   1194528|00000000||Me strength's gone.
   1194530|00000000||Miserable. And hungry.
   1185259|00000000||Make like a ball of yarn and unravel!
   1198579|00000000||They say that witcher drove the vandaguild from Mont Crane! He killed Filibert Fourfingers, too, though before the bully croaked - chop! He made him Filibert Nofingers!
   1198581|00000000||Now Her Gracious Highness has ordered all the hills planted with garlic instead of vines. And every house in town must hang at least three bushels from its windows. To scare off the blood guzzlers!
   1198577|00000000||In my day, were those ever tourneys…! Once a knight's horse croaked on him. But he didn't back out, no, sir! He hired an ass from a peasant and, I kid you not, rode that ass to victory!
   1198583|00000000||But that is complete and utter claptrap!
   1198585|00000000||Bah! The nonsense that comes out of your mouth…
   1185267|00000000||Honestly? It's a shame you killed the Beast. Now we shall abandon all morality whatsoever!
   1185263|00000000||Sure, go on, drink up while you're young, coin in hand…
   1185265|00000000||Who would've thought? Knights trading in wine, while some witcher guards the common folk…
   1185261|00000000||Do you think the duquessa's death will change anything? Hardly!
   1185273|00000000||Aaah, the whole place is rubbed, botched and wanked…
   1185269|00000000||Your health - may you keep it ever more!
   1185271|00000000||Crikey! Help!
   1201362|00000000||He should've never taken this risk. Must've really wanted the armor.
   1209346|00000000||Looks like he came here to hunt the shaelmaar I slew.
   1209348|00000000||Cept he failed to make it home.
   1201358|00000000||Whatever beast the witcher was hunting, doesn't seem like he killed it.
   1205721|00000000||Gotta keep my eyes peeled.
   1201360|00000000||Left his school's symbol on the wall. Clever. Gotta keep a look out for more.
   1189647|00000000||More symbols… Where you gonna lead me?
   1201414|00000000||Collapsed building. Foundations probably caved in. Literally undermined.
   1201416|00000000||Cave entrance… Let's see if this witcher left any tracks.
   1204875|00000000||Must be the corpse of the witcher from the School of the Bear.
   1205650|00000000||I can probably make really good use of these diagrams.
   1205648|00000000||Remaining diagrams at the vineyard? Maybe I can find them.
   1194096|00000000||Aye, and pigs can fly!
   1194098|00000000||Fire be praised!
   1194100|00000000||Aaa, what?
   1194102|00000000||Good sir?
   1194104|00000000||Oooy!
   1194106|00000000||Please! Spare me!
   1194108|00000000||Heeeeelp!
   1191230|00000000||Wanna fight.
   1124780|00000000||The rules governing the Beauclair fist fighting circuit - are you familiar with them?
   1124782|00000000||Hmm, you fight… with fists… There much to add beyond that…?
   1124784|00000000||You must make a wager to join the contest. There are three champions. Challenge them all, defeat them honorably, and you may try your luck against the Maestro.
   1124733|00000000||Your mama…
   1124760|00000000||Guess you'd know - since your mom's a bitch.
   1124762|00000000||Ugh, pathetic. This'll be easy. What's wrong? Afraid? Gut feeling queasy?
   1124734|00000000||Think you're confused - that sounds a lot like your sister.
   1124768|00000000||Think you're confused, that sounds more like your sister. I'm immune to disease, but even I'd die if I kissed her.
   1124770|00000000||You aren't worthy to empty my sister's bedpan! You mange-ridden mutant! Not even a man!
   1196441|00000000||You're annoying.
   1197026|00000000||Now I know how you do it. Just annoy your opponents to death.
   1124776|00000000||Put up your guard!
   1124778|00000000||Finally…
   1191724|00000000||Let's end this pitiful farce. You, witcher, are the dullest man alive.
   1197031|00000000||Done with this. You're weak - just trying to avoid a fight.
   1196445|00000000||You're weak.
   1196443|00000000||Let's fight, already.
   1124731|00000000||Rather fight than chat.
   1124756|00000000||Fancy insults - not my thing. Know other more effective means.
   1124739|00000000||Bored of talking. Time to fight.
   1124736|00000000||Bored of talking. Time to fight.
   1196446|00000000||Let's fight, already.
   1196444|00000000||You're just too dumb to get insults this brutal.
   1197044|00000000||See why'd you say that, you dim flapdoodle. Too dumb to grasp insults this brutal.
   1191721|00000000||Ehh, I've got to admit - you know how to roast a man. You win.
   1197143|00000000||Mean we're not gonna fight?
   1197145|00000000||Why? I told you, you've won.
   1197007|00000000||Should've quit before we began - gonna make you wish you'd turned tail and ran.
   1197010|00000000||Why, you… bad, uh…
   1196442|00000000||Should've quit before we even began.
   1124764|00000000||Your bones look thin, your breathing's wheezy.
   1172071|00000000||Afraid one punch might kill you - it's got me uneasy.
   1124737|00000000||Afraid I might kill you - it's got me uneasy.
   1124738|00000000||Yeah. Because you stink.
   1124766|00000000||Yeah. You stink something vicious. It's making me sick.
   1197005|00000000||Pfff… Give it up, go home, your efforts are futile. Your wit's as flaccid as a wet noodle.
   1124772|00000000||Your mother must've walked many a wood alone. Got those nekker eyes, that nekker nose…
   1124774|00000000||My mother loved me, at the least. That's nothing any witcher can claim.
   1124735|00000000||Your mama…
   1124758|00000000||Your taunts? I've heard dogs retch things more profound. Hear how pathetic and stupid you sound?
   1191617|00000000||Well, how then is this for a clever tongue-twister - you're a bumbotching, blackened bile-filled blister!
   1124732|00000000||Hear how pathetic and stupid you sound?
   1124744|00000000||Fine. Let's start.
   1124746|00000000||Oooh! My knees quake like a carnival rattle!
   1124748|00000000||Let's get on with this ridiculous battle.
   1124750|00000000||I'm a top taunter, the best around - not one to be beaten by some inbred hound!
   1124707|00000000||Count me in. Sign me up.
   1124787|00000000||Don't want to fight just now.
   1124789|00000000||Should you change your mind, look in on us again.
   1124785|00000000||Rather not fight just now.
   1124708|00000000||Mancomb? Odd name.
   1124752|00000000||Mancomb? First I've ever encountered that name.
   1124754|00000000||One should never judge an opponent by his name. Master Mancomb is a saddler, though a valiant one at that. His blows are as fierce as his ripostes are sharp.
   1124726|00000000||Do you wish to jump in?
   1124728|00000000||Considering it.
   1124730|00000000||So you're not surprised, consider this as well - here intellect counts as much as strength.
   1191195|00000000||You see, Mancomb is no ordinary fighter.
   1160418|00000000||Ready to fight?
   1194532|00000000||Somethin's rank.
   1194534|00000000||*Sniff sniff sniff* Eurgh.
   1194536|00000000||Nothin' doin', somethin' reeks around here.

Together they charged the enemy trying to harm their queen.</i><br>– “The Kikimore Princess and the Mountain Giants” <br>Cornelius Briggs (dwarven children’s fable, fragment)<br><br>It is unknown how exactly it is kikimores communicate with each other. Autopsies are hampered by the high toxicity of their subjects. Scholars have established that kikimores do not seem to possess any detectable auricles. One amateur researcher, Count di Salvaress, put forth a theory in his treatise “A Microscope Among Monsters” suggesting kikimores have a highly developed sense of smell and use airborne particles undetectable to humans to transmit information. This theory has yet to be proved or disproved.<br>
   1208685|00000000||Kikimore warriors defend their nests from attackers. They attack somewhat slower than kikimore workers. They are able to spew streams of caustic venom a great distance and leap to attack. This venom is highly unique in that it reacts with a witcher's body to raise the level of his potion toxicity. They are covered with thick, hard armor which easily deflects blows from even the sharpest sword.<br><br>Kikimore warriors are protected by swarms of workers which obey their orders until they are themselves eradicated.<br><br>They are completely immune to the effects of the Axii Sign, but vulnerable to Igni, oils and bombs harming insectoids and blows dealt by a silver sword.

   1186023|00000000||I would hate to come off as impertinent, but was it not you who won the tourney, Sir Graylocks?
   1186021|00000000||Sir de Peyrac-Peyran dead… How the mighty fall.
   1186019|00000000||You'd best behave, friend. You're in Beauclair, see?
   1186017|00000000||Ugh, the dungboots that visit our town. They come but to pour wine down their peasant gullets and start quarrels.
   1192939|00000000||Did you hear? Some stranger from the North won the tourney. They say he's a… witchman, or something of the sort…
   1192941|00000000||Have you heard? It's raining cows at the Ardaiso quarry! Not frogs, not cats and dogs, but cows!
   1192943|00000000||I tell you, no man knows the day or the hour!
   1192945|00000000||The merchant, the one so giddy the hanse let him go? He drank himself stupid, fell in the lake and drowned!
   1186026|00000000||Whoa! Calm down!
   1186030|00000000||You must loosen up, else you'll pop a cork.
   1186024|00000000||Ahoy, ahoy.
   1192947|00000000||I don't give a fig one way or the other.
   1192949|00000000||You don't say?!
   1186028|00000000||Boor!
   1186764|00000000||Your muttering speaks volumes.
   1186762|00000000||Did you say something?
   1186766|00000000||You can drive the rube from the village, but you'll never drive the village out of the rube!

   1181202|00000000||What is this?!
   1181206|00000000||For the Beast, what bait will you use? We've not many rams, and virgins fewer still!
   1181208|00000000||Did you see, witcher?! Vampires all about! Every-diddly-where!
   1181210|00000000||My two coppers? Get your bum out of here, quick. The duquessa is apt to change her mind.

   1208908|00000000||Wandering about the slopes of Mount Gorgon, Geralt came upon some grim, foreboding ruins. He set about exploring them and nearly tripped over a corpse. As always, he searched the body for a journal or letter that could shed some light on the circumstances of the individual's death. This time, too, this routine paid off. He found a journal and a key…<br>
   1208909|00000000||The journal detailed an unsuccessful experiment that had resulted in Bastoy Prison being destroyed. The witcher also learned of a chest full of gold that remained hidden within the ruins.<br>
   1208910|00000000||Geralt located the chest. The key he had found with the journal worked like a charm. So the witcher scooped up the gold and ran off to spend it!<br>
   1208906|00000000||Read the journal.
   1208907|00000000||Find the treasure.
   1208911|00000000||The Toussaint Prison Experiment
   1189088|00000000||Wait here.
   1189091|00000000||Ah!
   1152578|00000000||I'm here.
   1192510|00000000||This belong to you, maybe?
   1192512|00000000||It did. But you may keep it. I've a new one.
   1154558|00000000||I do not know you. I've done you no harm.
   1164967|00000000||Yet first you butchered a bruxa who was dear to me. Now you pursue me. Why?
   1154560|00000000||You've killed four innocent people. At least.
   1154562|00000000||And you? How many innocents have you cut down?
   1154564|00000000||Many.
   1154638|00000000||Plenty. Even more of the guilty, though. You're next.
   1154704|00000000||Hm, I think not. You see, I've something to do still.
   1154706|00000000||More murders?
   1154708|00000000||Just one.
   1171232|00000000||Not counting yours.
   1154565|00000000||None.
   1154641|00000000||I don't kill innocents. Murderers, though? You bet.
   1154928|00000000||I'll soon be done. I've but one left. And you, should you not stand down.
   1154930|00000000||And once you're done, intend to leave, go kill somewhere else?
   1171643|00000000||No. I intend to live.
   1154932|00000000||Happily ever after.
   1154628|00000000||Not here to talk about me.
   1154630|00000000||Yet that is exactly what we are doing. So, did they send you after me? Who are they?
   1154632|00000000||What do you mean, "they"? Duchess hired me. You've been murdering her subjects.
   1154634|00000000||Hmhmhmhm, is it as simple as that?
   1154636|00000000||I would ask you to convey to the duchess that I've but one victim left, but…
   1169921|00000000||You'll not get the chance.
   1154563|00000000||Conversation's not about me.
   1208783|00000000||Ach!
   1208785|00000000||What the botch?
   1208787|00000000||Ugh!
   1208789|00000000||Aaauugh!
   1208791|00000000||What was that?!
   1152631|00000000||I won't let you kill again!
   1197677|00000000||Some knavish knight abducted poor Jean Louis! Apparently, the rogue burned with passion for the hairdresser, but Jean Louis rejected him…
   1197679|00000000||Did you hear about Madame de Bourbeau? She left her husband and ran off with some farm boy!
   1197675|00000000||Two of those purportedly virtuous knights pummeled each other over a dockside whore. Apparently, they argued who would go first!
   1186822|00000000||A Beast like that probably has no one to split a bottle with.
   1186824|00000000||What is they call you? Gervant?
   1186826|00000000||Come, I must give you a squeeze, hero!

   1178273|00000000||<i>The best defense against spotted wights? Stay calm and leave them alone.</i><br>– fragment of a treatise on spotted wights by Roderick Giligan.<br><br>Spotted wights were a subspecies of wight which the witchers drove to extinction. They were larger than their unspotted kin and owed their names to their numerous blotches and effusions. Spotted wights would most often dwell in derelict cemeteries and empty wildernesses, yet at times took to living in abandoned human domiciles. There they would indulge in their greatest passion: creating brews from their own emissions.<br><br>When not disturbed, spotted wights would not act aggressively. If threatened, however, they became very dangerous indeed. In the colder months or when faced with an unseasonable chill, they would slip into a state of lethargy, making them easy targets. Even during their active periods, it is said the witchers found a surefire way of besting them, based around careful casting of the Yrden Sign – or at least, so claims witcher lore…
   1208960|00000000||Whenever on the one hand witchers swear they have driven a certain species of monster into extinction and one the other someone claims to have seen a member of that species walking around in apparent health, most likely we are dealing with a curse. This rule of thumb showed its worth with the spotted wight from the Trastamara estate. It turned out this creature was in fact a woman transformed into a monster by a curse many years prior, as punishment for refusing food and shelter to a wandering beggar.

   1181794|00000000||I'm not at all fond of that chain you wear. It clashes horribly with my dress.
   1189428|00000000||But it's my dynastic crest…
   1189430|00000000||I don't like it.
   1181796|00000000||Very well, darling. I shall put it away.
   1181798|00000000||My mother's invited us to afternoon tea tomorrow. She would like very much to meet you.
   1181800|00000000||But I told you, my dear. We're expected tomorrow at a Mandragora soirée.
   1201762|00000000||Well… take care, you two… love birds.
   1201748|00000000||Good luck.
   1201747|00000000||Noticed any changes? Any symptoms?
   1201750|00000000||Noticed any changes? Anything strange on your body? Troubling symptoms?
   1201752|00000000||Ah… Hm, how shall I put this? Ahem… I've grown some feathers… well, down, to be precise.
   1201754|00000000||Whereabouts?
   1201756|00000000||Ahhh…. Why mention it. It's such a minor a problem.
   1201758|00000000||Personally, I like it.
   1150480|00000000||Greetings, witcher.
   1150482|00000000||You're well? Everything seem in order?
   1150484|00000000||We are. And it is. I thank you again, Geralt.
   1181802|00000000||For a boy, I'm most fond of Vivaldi. And our daughter we shall name Marilla.
   1181804|00000000||Yes, my beloved, yes.
   1206989|00000000||Get out! Begone!
   1206991|00000000||Out! Now!
   1206993|00000000||Yes? You've a concern?

   1202751|00000000||Move, witcher!
   1202755|00000000||Witcher, we must find Rhena! Quickly!
   1202747|00000000||Come, Geralt, we must hurry.
   1176384|00000000||Gotta move on. Get into the keep…
   1202662|00000000||Need to get into the keep.
   1202664|00000000||They shall pay. For everything.

   1144473|00000000||I've got something of my own to pull out!

   1165386|00000000||What's your wish? A dash of wine and some slap and tickle?
   1165388|00000000||I can see you slurping me with your eyes, White One!
   1172867|00000000||Geralt read it, and all became clear. An unhappy, unrequited love had pushed the young man to commit suicide. Ah, I know so many stories that echo this one… Yet this one differed from the others in that evil powers were involved. The journal also mentioned a stash of buried jewels. So Geralt resolved to learn more and directed his steps towards the estate the diary described.<br>
   1172868|00000000||Geralt explored the Cutterin residence and found the treasure mentioned in the journal. Content with this surprising find, he set off in search of new challenges.<br>
   1172866|00000000||Wandering about the primeval forest that covered the duchy's frontier, the witcher made a discovery most macabre. Deep in the forest, a small hut. Alongside the hut, a tree. Upon the tree, a hanged man. On the ground directly beneath the corpse lay a journal.<br>
   1172869|00000000||Read the notes.
   1172870|00000000||Find the jewels.

   1207198|00000000||<i>They say the dead like quiet. I don’t know about the dead, but wights certainly do.</i><br> – Heinrich Von Grott<br><br>Though wights are ghastly and threatening in appearance, one should not approach them with sword drawn or attack them unprovoked. Left alone, they present no serious danger to anyone and are far more interested in mixing noxious brews in cauldrons than in fighting. This species mainly lives around ancient burial sites, though they have also been spotted near more recently-founded cemeteries and wherever mass graves can be found.<br><br>Wights spend the winter months in a state of lethargy very similar to human sleep. They live strictly solitary lives -- in fact, it is practically unheard of for these creatures to appear in groups. Yet when they fear their territory is threatened (and it is enough for one to step foot in a wight’s territory for it to feel threatened), wights transform into dangerous foes and even abandon their solitary ways to summon other monsters to their aid.<br>
   1208884|00000000||It is a certainty that if a wight finds itself in danger, it will immediately spew out an ectoplasmic solution which near instantaneously transforms into barghests. These beasts obey the wight and attack anyone it deems a foe. If one of them is killed, the wight tries to replace it at once.<br><br>The best strategy when fighting such a wight is to take out the monsters guarding it with the Axii sign before attacking the wight itself. Wights are resistant to poison, but vulnerable to silver.

They are quick, agile and, like all cats, diabolically cunning. In many less-than-thoroughly-urbanized areas, folk still believe panthers are the stranded souls of those who die in their sleep. Superstition thus holds anyone perishing in this way should be dragged to the nearest woods and left there without a burial. The panther-spirit of the deceased may then devour its own body, thereby passing on to the nether realms.<br><br>This belief must be eradicated by any means, for it leads to epidemics of cholera and other contagious diseases born of rotting corpses.<br><br>Besides, it is patently ridiculous, given panthers are not necrophages and will not consume carrion of any sort. They prefer more spry and lively prey, such as deer or even humans, provided they are not ill and do not stink too badly.<br>
   1208645|00000000||Panthers (and their tawny-coated cousins, mountain lions) are incredibly swift and able to sneak up on prey undetected to gain the advantage of surprise.<br><br>As soon as they enter open terrain, they leap to attack with astonishing speed, mauling their prey with their sharp claws, long teeth and the sheer force of their momentum.<br><br>Panthers are known to retreat mid-fight, yet do not let yourself be fooled into a false sense of security. This is but a ruse to allow them to attack again, by surprise. Never drop your guard until you see the animal drop dead.<br><br>Panthers are vulnerable to the effects of all the Signs, as well as bombs and oils.

   1196269|00000000||Witcher.
   1196271|00000000||Greetings.
   1196273|00000000||Hey!
   1163955|00000000||Geralt… I'd never wish to give the impression I do not enjoy your company - the truth is quite the opposite, in fact - however…
   1195918|00000000||Yeah, I know. Dettlaff's not likely to show up long as I'm here. But five minutes won't save us, will it?
   1195972|00000000||I suppose not. I was wrong to press you to go. You wished to ask something…?
   1209033|00000000||But while we're at it, be so good and explain to me how it was you acquired that startling scar on your face. Forgive me for being direct, but it's tormented me for some time, now.
   1209038|00000000||Ugh, long story, actually. Let's just say I struck up with some unsavory folk. No worries, though. I'll get out of it.
   1163959|00000000||Just wondering… what if Dettlaff doesn't show?
   1195974|00000000||He'll show.
   1195977|00000000||Ugh… Tell me, how's this work? When I need a short answer, concise, quick, you're likely to give me a scholarly lecture. But when I could use some details, elaboration, all's I get is a few grunts. What's that about?
   1195979|00000000||Allow me to explain. When speaking of facts, tangible matters, I do indeed strive to express myself precisely and at length.
   1195981|00000000||However, when our discussions center on affairs of the intuition or things vampiric, my utterances are indeed towards the taciturn. For even the longest discourse would not allow me to explain to my interlocutor any issue of this purview satisfactorily.
   1195983|00000000||Therefore, I repeat - Dettlaff will show. Sooner or later.
   1195125|00000000||What happens if Dettlaff doesn't show?
   1163957|00000000||Take care, Regis.
   1153891|00000000||So long.
   1195124|00000000||How'd you and Dettlaff meet anyway?
   1195987|00000000||Been meaning to ask you… how'd you and Dettlaff meet?
   1195989|00000000||Hm, hm. A somewhat… uncomfortable subject.
   1195991|00000000||I'm all ears and I got time.
   1195993|00000000||As you well know, during my teething years I had a… spell… during which I abused blood. Among vampiric youth I was, all false modesty aside, rather popular. I ran with the plasma crowd. I made a great many acquaintances… one of whom was Dettlaff.
   1195995|00000000||But… our paths soon diverged. You see, our band had an appetite for chasing youthful capers. Blood-guzzling contests, that sort of thing - "let's turn into bats and terrify the ladies." Dettlaff thought it all foolish. He was right, of course… though I only came to understand this later.
   1196011|00000000||Sorry… just can't imagine you as a young vampire rabble-rouser, renegade, punk.
   1196013|00000000||You know of our exceedingly long lifespans… They allow us plenty of time to change. I, for one, thank the gods for that.
   1195985|00000000||Yes, Geralt?
   1191518|00000000||Greetings.
   1191520|00000000||Hmm…
   1195774|00000000||You're pushin' it, friend.
   1195776|00000000||Gonna kill you.
   1195778|00000000||Fuck!
   1195780|00000000||I'm runnin' outta patience.
   1195782|00000000||That's right.
   1195784|00000000||Your choice, you pleb.

   1207037|00000000||<i>Well, since it seems this hair won’t be pulling up any knights in shining armor, might as well put it to some use.</i><br> – the last words of Longlocks.<br><br>Everyone knows love stories can have tragic endings, but few would think this also applies to princesses from fairy tales created to relive a set happy ending over and over again. Longlocks had the misfortune of becoming just such an unlikely tragic heroine. After the duke’s daughters grew up and the Land of a Thousand Fables went feral, Longlocks, whose prince never came and who suffered greatly from her loneliness, decided to hang herself by her own braid. After she died, her ghost stayed to haunt the castle in which she had awaited her suitor.

   1124933|00000000||You're tormented. By what?
   1115776|00000000||Forgive me, but I must ask directly - are you a man? I… I no longer trust my senses.
   1164653|00000000||Not exactly. I'm a witcher. Quite a few folk think I don't deserve to be classified as a member of the human species. Know some personally.
   1164662|00000000||A witcher…? But no, nor can you help me.
   1164664|00000000||We'll see. Just tell me what the problem is.
   1164560|00000000||No. I'm a witcher.
   1164561|00000000||Yes.
   1164659|00000000||Yes. Meaning, I'm physical, no specter or vision, if that's what you fear. Don't trust your senses? Why?
   1164825|00000000||A foulness, a demon or wraith, haunts me. Grants me no rest. It wants something, I sense this, but know not what. Each day it appears, tarries, then leaves. It's here now - there, beyond the trees.
   1164564|00000000||Don't see a thing.
   1164809|00000000||Of course not. It cannot be seen.
   1164811|00000000||Yet you see it…?
   1164818|00000000||Only when I drink the brew. Which brings a pain to my head, nausea. But I endure these to keep an eye on the wraith, my tormentor.
   1142038|00000000||What's the demon look like?
   1125052|00000000||This demon of yours… can you describe it?
   1125054|00000000||It is an enormous horse, its hoof beats pounding in the dark. It gallops to me, stops, stares… then runs on.
   1125148|00000000||Sure it's not just a wild horse, run-of-the-mill?
   1142044|00000000||The creature is not of this world. When it gazes at me, a terrible chill pervades my soul.
   1191732|00000000||It is evil condensed, its eyes black, void… Each time it comes, terror grips me, I cease what I'm doing, still my breath and heart.
   1142023|00000000||The brew - what's it made of?
   1142026|00000000||What's your brew made of? Gotta wonder what's causing such strong visions. You drop in some mushroom? Chumbertub? Dancing dewlap?
   1142028|00000000||Close. The common graytop. I see you know your herbs.
   1142042|00000000||Graytop? Variety's extinct, if I recall correctly.
   1170073|00000000||Nearly, but not quite. I was able to grow a few from dried spores. I'd hoped a brew of graytop would reveal this nightmare. I was not wrong.
   1170075|00000000||Far as I know, graytop produces some powerful side effects. Though it can, in fact, reveal the hidden, the immaterial…
   1187476|00000000||Yes, I see the evil… Better that than to know it is there, but not know where.
   1188942|00000000||A king's ransom, that!
   1188944|00000000||I feel we could agree, were you to go a few lower.
   1125021|00000000||Fine. You seem sure something's out there. I'll see what I can do.
   1142058|00000000||Start by taking a look around.
   1125018|00000000||I'll try to help.
   1125029|00000000||You're taking hallucinogens, a steady diet. Stop and your specter problem'll go away. Farewell.
   1125019|00000000||Stop taking hallucinogens. Problem'll go away on its on.
   1188938|00000000||Let's talk about my pay.
   1188940|00000000||Need to talk about how much I'll get paid, first.
   1188952|00000000||Is it gold you want?
   1188954|00000000||Orens or Novigrad crowns. Florens'll work, too.
   1188956|00000000||I've none of any coin. I've nothing, in fact. Just… potatoes in the cellar. A good crop this year. Tend to this quickly, completely, and several sacks will be yours. Agreed?
   1191730|00000000||If that's the case, no pay required. Need those potatoes more than I do.
   1191726|00000000||Don't need any pay.
   1191725|00000000||Fine. Potatoes it is.
   1191728|00000000||Don't have a choice, I guess. Potatoes it is, but how many?
   1188948|00000000||Unthinkable. What good is your aid if I starve come winter? Take what I offer. or begone and leave me in peace.
   1188946|00000000||Agreed. That many I can spare.
   1146930|00000000||Witcher. Will you help me after all?
   1165580|00000000||La, la la, la laa la la!

   1198381|00000000||Thanks, good game.
   1198383|00000000||Bollock blisters, what hurts most is fuckin' Skellige won. But as they say, "tough shite." Congrats!
   1198385|00000000||I won! Now youse can shove all this Skellige mince up yer arses!
   1198387|00000000||You won 'cause you played better, not because the faction's weak.
   1199940|00000000||Aye, right, I knows what I saw.
   1198389|00000000||Well played, thank you for a scintillating game. I trust my victory has convinced all doubters of the value of the new faction.
   1198391|00000000||Ye won 'cause ye played better. Even if ye hadnae played as ploughing Skellige, ye woulda won anyhow. Congrats all the same - Yaki Rafiberg's no sore loser.
   1198393|00000000||C'mon, lads! Let's get soused!
   1198399|00000000||No, you must stay, for I wish to treat you all to a tipple! We must toast the premier of the new faction! And if anyone wishes to play a friendly match of gwent, I see no reason why not!
   1167723|00000000||Thank you for everything, witcher.
   1200116|00000000||No problem, had fun.
   1200113|00000000||No problem.
   1200114|00000000||Didn't all go as planned.
   1200118|00000000||Don't think that went exactly as you'd planned.
   1200120|00000000||What matters is we played gwent, and I presented the Skellige faction.
   1167743|00000000||You proved yourself a true gwent master. Here, the grand prize - you earned it.
   1167745|00000000||Thank you very much, Count.
   1198401|00000000||Yet most important of all to me is that you fulfilled my brother's wish, so I would like to give you something else.
   1199942|00000000||The most precious card of his collection. May it serve you well.
   1199944|00000000||Thanks. It's an honor, count.
   1167747|00000000||I am glad to have met you. I desire to do one more thing for you, witcher. Such is my nature. Is there any way I could be of service?
   1167749|00000000||During the tournament I lost my silver sword. I'd like to get it back, because that's how I earn my wages.
   1167751|00000000||I believe I shall be able to help.
   1167753|00000000||Would you be so kind, good sir, as to agree to return Geralt his sword - in exchange for a blade once belonging to the famed knight Rydygier?
   1169526|00000000||Yes, but the sword of Rydygier in the sands of time sank…
   1169528|00000000||I assure you, that is far from the truth. In that case… it's settled.
   1167755|00000000||Fine is this blade, may it continue to well serve you.
   1167757|00000000||Thank you, count. And you, sir.
   1167759|00000000||Generosity is a virtue.
   1167777|00000000||Thank you once more for deigning to take part in my little tournament. I hope we shall meet again.
   1167779|00000000||Who knows… farewell.
   1167735|00000000||I'm sorry you did not manage to qualify for the finals. I'd hoped to face you, but participation alone counts for something. Here, a consolation prize.
   1167737|00000000||Thanks.

It is rare indeed, however, to come across an isolated individual, for kikimore workers usual move in groups of a few to a dozen or so members. The only defense against a swarm of kikimores available to a normal person is to flee. And not even that is guaranteed to work.<br>
   1208688|00000000||Kikimore workers listen to orders given by kikimore warriors. On command, a swarm of workers might begin burrowing tunnels near potential prey to allow for a surprise mass attack. Eliminate the warrior guiding a swarm, however, and the workers will disperse and cease digging.<br><br>Kikimore workers are nimbler and quicker than warriors.<br><br>They show complete immunity to the Axii Sign, and when they dig tunnels, they are invulnerable to all the other Signs as well. Poison also does them no harm.<br><br>A good method for fighting them is to use the Igni Sign as well as oils and bombs meant to damage insectoids.

   1198562|00000000||The duchess means for that witcher to settle here permanently. She gave him a vineyard for that very reason. Now that we've him to protect us, all those erring knights - woosh! - can retire early!

   1212623|00000000||While seeking a bit of respite amidst the forests that covered the slopes of Mount Gorgon, Geralt ran into… a dead man and a pack of barghests! Once he had dealt with the spectral canines, he decided to search the pockets of the unlucky traveler. The witcher hoped he would find something that would shed some light on the deceased's last days alive.<br>
   1212624|00000000||The dead man proved none other than a treasure hunter. That, at least, is how I would like to think of and term him (for there is no honor in speaking ill of the dead). His notes indicated that he and some others of his ilk had dug up an elven cemetery near the  village of Fox Hollow. However, they had dug up one jewel too many…<br>When the feelings of guilt and shame had grown to be too much, and the expedition's members had begun, one by one, to disappear, Alistair Carnarvon, for that was our deceased hero's name, had decided to inform a group of scholars at Castel Graupian of his find. Said scholars, he believed, would look to the ancient necropolis and extend their care over it. Alas, he had never managed to reach the scholars, and the treasures he had left behind in the camp were now ownerless…<br>
   1212625|00000000||Geralt found the camp as well as a field that had been dug up thoroughly. Strewn about it were the urns and remains of elves who had been buried there. The chest Alistair had left behind contained no burial jewels. It was, however, full of gold and highly interesting diagrams. The witcher concluded he was free to take it all, and in doing so he would not disturb the Aen Seidhe who lay there in eternal slumber.<br>
   1212626|00000000||Read Carnarvon's journal.
   1212627|00000000||Find the treasure hidden in the treasure hunters' camp.

   1201973|00000000||At a sacred site of the cult of the Prophet Lebioda, Geralt stumbled upon the remains of one of the prophet's most fervent adherents - a monk known as the Great Beggar. Alas, the poor man had been bricked up alive and left to starve in the wall of the chapel, so his restless soul promptly attacked the witcher. Geralt knew that the only way to help the Great Beggar's soul to find peace was to give his remains a proper burial.<br>
   1201974|00000000||Luckily, Geralt did not have to search far for an appropriate sarcophagus. He laid the Great Beggar's bones in a grave within the chapel, thus securing his rattled soul's eternal rest.<br>
   1201975|00000000||Find an empty sarcophagus and place the bones in it.

   1115578|00000000||What's this about?
   1100637|00000000||Monsters! Monsters, there, in the cave!
   1101362|00000000||We managed to flee. But Hugo remains inside!
   1153831|00000000||Hugo?
   1153833|00000000||Our brother! He's still in there, inside!
   1101366|00000000||Help us! Find him! We'll pay you for your toil!
   1101468|00000000||What attacked you? Exactly.
   1097683|00000000||Notice what attacked you?
   1097685|00000000||There was no time! We ran for the exit as soon as we felt the earth quiver! But Hugo, well, he went the other way.
   1168229|00000000||So, monsters crawl out of the ground?
   1168231|00000000||I… I suppose… In truth, I don't know. We just ran, did not look back.
   1153872|00000000||Why'd you go in there to begin with?
   1153874|00000000||Why'd you even go in there?
   1153876|00000000||We… lost our way…
   1153878|00000000||Mh. Mistake that cave for the highroad?
   1153880|00000000||By the hair on my chinny chin chin, what difference does it make whether we went for a stroll or to gather sewants? Hugo remains inside, in grave danger! That's what matters!
   1153882|00000000||Will you go in after him or not? Every second could be vital!
   1162032|00000000||You the ones looking for someone to escort you?
   1162034|00000000||You post that notice? About an escort?
   1162036|00000000||Yes, we did! And not without cause, it seems! We waited some days, yet when none answered, we risked the expedition unaccompanied.
   1162038|00000000||Fools we were. We'd have done better to show patience, wait… Poor Hugo - left to an unknown fate!
   1179425|00000000||Let's talk about my… fee.
   1179427|00000000||I could look into it… but it'll cost you.
   1179692|00000000||How much would you take?
   1179429|00000000||Alas, that is not an amount we could ever muster. Might you take a little less?
   1179431|00000000||This, this is more than we hoped to spend, but minimally so. Might you drop your price a bit?
   1164200|00000000||You're back! Will you find Hugo? Save him?
   1164328|00000000||He's still in there! Alone! He'll likely die if you don't help!
   1100657|00000000||Fine. I'll look for him. You two stay out here.
   1164201|00000000||Fine. See what I can do.
   1101467|00000000||No time, can't help.
   1093884|00000000||Come on. You two made it out. Your brother will too. I'm not needed here.
   1153896|00000000||But--
   1093890|00000000||It's no use, Auguste. The witcher clearly refuses to aid us. Perhaps another will read the notice, come along.
   1153898|00000000||But should you change your mind, we'll be waiting here!
   1164202|00000000||I'm not needed here.
   1186938|00000000||My fee - let's talk.
   1179435|00000000||We are not fashioned of gold. We cannot afford this amount.
   1179433|00000000||A reasonable price.
   1101466|00000000||Fine. I'll help.
   1194080|00000000||Greetings.
   1194082|00000000||What do you want?

   1194086|00000000||Why don't y'all just get off my back!
   1194088|00000000||Oy!
   1194090|00000000||Bobbery!
   1194092|00000000||Help! Good folk!
   1207711|00000000||No! No! Leave me be!
   1207713|00000000||Monsters attacking!
   1207715|00000000||Run! Flee! They'll cut us down!
   1183486|00000000||Not your concern, neither of those things.
   1173608|00000000||Neither's your concern.
   1173610|00000000||No concern of ours, you say… Perhaps not. But we've got eyes… and can see those razors you got on your back right clear.
   1173616|00000000||He's a witcher. Boholt and his boys, he's their mate. Heard of him. Geralt of Rivia's the name.
   1171322|00000000||We'll take it on together.
   1171320|00000000||We'll go at it as a bunch. Just stay clear of my sword.
   1173795|00000000||Right, now, lads. You've heard the specialist.
   1197352|00000000||There.
   1197354|00000000||Grab your ballies! Shoot the bitch down!
   1196955|00000000||All good and fine, but the monster's not in its nest. Gotta track it down first.
   1196957|00000000||Not at all necessary, Geralt. We looked into it, gave it a think. Traders used tannin to lure the beast. Who says we can't do the same?
   1196959|00000000||You got any tannin?
   1197349|00000000||Came into a bit, aye. Here! Willin' to do the honors?
   1171318|00000000||Use your crossbows. Keep her on the ground. Good idea.
   1173766|00000000||D'you say "her"?
   1173768|00000000||It's a female, yeah.
   1173770|00000000||Hear that, lads? We've a learned witcher here. A hundred spans out an' he's spotted what the lizard's got between its legs.
   1173784|00000000||Right, now, lads. You've heard the specialist. Ready your crossbows.
   1171321|00000000||Use your crossbows.
   1171304|00000000||Beast has to die. We work together, we'll make quick work of it.
   1175796|00000000||After all I told you of Iocaste, you would murder her?! Oh, you will regret this, friend! I know folk! I shall tell them you slew the last surviving specimen!
   1173654|00000000||Sorry, master di Salvaress. Actually, not sorry. A monster's a monster. Silvery, plaid or polka-dotted… last or next-to-last specimen - doesn't matter. It's a dangerous predator that kills humans. Enough said.
   1175804|00000000||Herbalists, alchemists - I know many! They will despise you! I shall tell them of a heartless cur who cares not an ounce for balance in nature. You shall pay arms and legs for their wares. More!
   1171308|00000000||Somebody plug this lordlin's gob, eh? Right, master witcher. How do we aim to fight the filth?
   1173656|00000000||We've crossbows. Could ply it with bolts while you do the hack and slash. Or all go at it as a bunch, blades in hand, fire in our hearts. You decide, you're the one with experience.
   1171237|00000000||Beast needs to die. Let's do it.
   1183635|00000000||Don't need any more coin.
   1183646|00000000||Don't need any more. Rather you paid it out to the families of your pet's victims.
   1183648|00000000||Noble of you, master. I shall take the advice to heart.
   1175740|00000000||Iocaste has flown her nest.
   1175742|00000000||Must've sensed a threat. Likely to return eventually, though.
   1183631|00000000||She'll return. Always does. I suspect I might even know where she's gone. I tracked her a way and believe she might have found a new mate. It's an ordinary basilisk, not a silvery one…
   1187856|00000000||But something might come of it, who knows. Iocaste could lay new eggs. Perhaps produce an entirely new crossbreed?
   1183633|00000000||Sure hope not. Take care.
   1183644|00000000||Thanks.
   1183634|00000000||Thanks.
   1171425|00000000||You spared Iocaste, I thank you. And be assured I'll take great care she not dine on any other souls.
   1173839|00000000||Gotta try harder, figure out a way to keep folk out of this area.
   1171427|00000000||That I shall do. Master, you must accept more, be it a symbolic sum. Had you not come along, the Reavers would surely have slain my Iocaste.
   1171310|00000000||Basilisk lives for now. We're not gonna kill it.
   1171314|00000000||A witcher defendin' a beast? Ever seen that, lads? You like them peaches?
   1171316|00000000||Argh… No scrappin' with filth today, it seems. But, but… you made some mention o' coin, as I recall.
   1183584|00000000||I did indeed. And a word once given…
   1183629|00000000||Your share, witcher.
   1183912|00000000||Hahaha! Easiest job I've ever done. Godspeed, witcher. Strange workin' with you. Strange but nice.
   1183914|00000000||Godspeed, boys.
   1171238|00000000||Basilisk's not to be killed.
   1173618|00000000||A professional. Good you came along. Can take on the brute together. Talk is the venom's somethin' horrifyin'.
   1173621|00000000||Could use another pair of hands. Fee what we've gotten from the guild, we'll share it fair and square. You in?
   1173623|00000000||Gentlemen, this hurts my ears and pains my heart! You aim to kill Iocaste? It cannot be! The creature is protected!
   1183566|00000000||If you fear to lose the guild's reward, I shall repay it. And reward you doubly to leave the beast be! You cannot slay the last living specimen of a near extinct subspecies.
   1175903|00000000||Willin' to pay, are you? Long as we do nothin'? That's rather novel. What say you to that, master? Far as I know, beast's culled the human race by five already.
   1183541|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. I'm a witcher. Know your brethren in arms - Boholt, Kennet and Desbrut. Newboy, too.
   1183545|00000000||Aaah, you're that witcher! Aye, Boholt mentioned you. Said you swing a mean sword.
   1183485|00000000||Geralt of Rivia. We've got mutual acquaintances.
   1171288|00000000||Jamor, Auwry, prepare the equipment. Beast's wandered off somewheres. We gotsta lure it back.
   1171290|00000000||And who might you be?
   1171292|00000000||Funny. About to ask you the same.
   1171294|00000000||They call us the Reavers.
   1183484|00000000||Reavers? Wouldn't happen to hail from Crinfrid, would you?
   1171296|00000000||Aye, we do. But how's it you know? And again - who the hell are you?
   1197116|00000000||Corpse… a mercenary's, seems. Shredded. Basilisk has left its nest, clearly.
   1207189|00000000||Butchers! This is barbarous! What did she ever do to you?! Stop! My Iocaste! Do not slay her!
   1207191|00000000||Wretch's got somethin' in that skulls of 'ers. Not about to roost in its nest with warriors on the prowl after it.
   1207262|00000000||It's afeared, all right. On account it senses we're true Reavers!
   1207264|00000000||Damned right!
   1211098|00000000||The vault is closed.
   1211100|00000000||It's all shut up. Step away, please.
   1186704|00000000||Death has taken Her Grace. We must drown our sorrows in drink…
   1186706|00000000||This marks the duchy's end. Its final hour!
   1186702|00000000||Wine - sunlight captured in a bottle.
   1186700|00000000||Art is not life's bread and butter but its fruit and wine.
   1186708|00000000||Go on! Kill me! Do the deed!
   1197299|00000000||My, my… That is quite the tale.
   1197297|00000000||Ehh, poppycock…
   1197288|00000000||The Monnart Brothers now make cognac so exquisite the emperor himself has put in an order!
   1197286|00000000||That witcher's been here before… As I recall, he slew a few beasts and stashed a pile of coin at Cianfanelli's!
   1197301|00000000||De Bourbeau's got horns from here to Mont Crane! His wife's been frolicking about with some stablehand!
   1186712|00000000||Yes, sir?
   1186710|00000000||Greetings and welcome!
   1194960|00000000||Bah!
   1194962|00000000||Hmph.
   1194964|00000000||This must be a mistake!
   1194966|00000000||Oh!
   1209585|00000000||You can't pull one over on me, witcher. I can see you're a killer.
   1209587|00000000||Stocks and the whip await those running riot! Our duchy values peace and quiet!
   1209583|00000000||Geralt of Rivia, slayer of the Beast. I am in your debt. We all are.
   1209589|00000000||Look lively! Rush at him, boys!
   1209593|00000000||Mumsy!
   1209595|00000000||You're one fast son of your mum!
   1209597|00000000||Did that hurt? Dammit, did it?!
   1209591|00000000||Toussaint!
   1209599|00000000||No!
   1209601|00000000||Come, now, keep calm!
   1209603|00000000||He shall not escape!
   1209605|00000000||Witcher! You'll put someone's eye out!
   1209607|00000000||Spells! He's hexing hard!
   1209609|00000000||Is that how it's to be?!
   1209611|00000000||That's more like it.
   1209615|00000000||Geralt of Rivia, perchance?
   1209613|00000000||At your service, witcher.
   1169844|00000000||According to some philosophers, everything we do in life leaves a permanent trace in the delicate matter which makes up our souls. Evil deeds, especially harm done to innocent creatures, can torment the soul of a sinner and cause it to remain restless, even after death.<br><br>While traveling through Toussaint, Geralt discovered there might be a grain of truth in these theories and folk beliefs. He came across a hermit whose sleep was troubled by some invisible phantom.<br>
   1169845|00000000||Geralt determined this phantom was an umbra, the ghost of a recently-deceased knight who had committed a terrible deed while alive and now visited the hermit to demand forgiveness. In his wraithly form he drank her blood and systematically deprived her of life energy.<br><br>The umbra appeared to the hermit as a horse, for the evil deed the knight had committed was to flog his own mount to death. The knight’s spirit was unaware of the demonic role he had assumed in the afterlife.<br><br>Geralt managed to figure out the key to freeing the knight’s ghost was to forgive him in the name of the hermit.

   1175134|00000000||We shall talk later. Let's find Dettlaff. We're close, I can feel it.
   1183022|00000000||We've no time to lose. It's not far, from what the lad said.
   1183829|00000000||Sure hope we don't scare him off…

   1206979|00000000||This is it for you, pal!
   1206981|00000000||Come on! Come tae daddy!
   1206965|00000000||Scalp the wee shite!
   1206970|00000000||And what might you want?
   1206968|00000000||Welcome to Cianfanelli Bank.
   1206972|00000000||Get out. That's your lot, chum.
   1206974|00000000||I thought we'd seen the last o' your mug.
   1206978|00000000||What can I do for ye?
   1206976|00000000||All in order?
   1186065|00000000||Pass a glass, fast!
   1186063|00000000||Tipple a tiddle of wine!
   1186069|00000000||Do you know the colors I would see on the duchy's banners? Red, white and rosé!
   1186067|00000000||Never you worry! The air here is such that one is never hungover!
   1177740|00000000||What's the hurry?
   1177738|00000000||Greetings.
   1177744|00000000||I must look to the pickers, make certain they don't snip clusters touched by mold…
   1177742|00000000||Of course I can tell they malinger, but who am I to judge?
   1158031|00000000||Ugh. Stinks.
   1163245|00000000||Water-logged, both hands amputated. Body was quartered, just as I thought.
   1158024|00000000||[Examine chest.]
   1158036|00000000||Body was chopped up after death.
   1166835|00000000||Blows struck with great force, but bones sliced through, not crushed.
   1166837|00000000||Creature that killed him had long claws, sharp as a witcher's blade. First sank its claws into the victim's heart.
   1166843|00000000||No bruxa did this.
   1158022|00000000||[Examine head.]
   1158039|00000000||Laid in water for some time. Head's swollen, and something took a few bites out of it.
   1166839|00000000||Hm. Something in the throat.
   1166841|00000000||A pouch. Bulging with coins.
   1187290|00000000||Nilfgaardian florens… from several different provinces.
   1175265|00000000||If the murderer did this, means we're dealing with a sentient, thinking beast.
   1185035|00000000||Nothing interesting besides the purse in his throat.
   1193745|00000000||[Examine the severed hand.]
   1208949|00000000||Third hand. A spare? Except it's clearly not the victim's. Guardsmen must've not noticed it as they picked everything up.
   1193749|00000000||How's this possible? Still warm. Blood's still flowing?
   1193947|00000000||Several monster species can regenerate. Never heard of that happening to their severed limbs, though. Or of their limbs seeming completely alive after so much time.
   1194384|00000000||Examine the tissue more closely later. Might learn something.
   1158021|00000000||[End examination.]
   1158041|00000000||So, murderer was clearly a monster, but not a bruxa.
   1160787|00000000||But then why'd the bruxa come here for the severed hand? And who does the hand belong to? Why the hell's it still warm?
   1194381|00000000||Now, pouch shoved down the victim's throat - what's the significance? And why was he chopped up into pieces?
   1166867|00000000||Lots of questions, no answers so far. Need to know about the other victims. I'll ask Palmerin to get me in to see the duchess.
   1179260|00000000||Hand from the bag didn't belong to this victim.
   1179262|00000000||Hm. Seems the bruxa was placing a third hand in her bag…
   1158049|00000000||Both arms separated from the torso.
   1202688|00000000||What the kusse is that?!
   1202690|00000000||We've to help them! Come, follow me!
   1202694|00000000||Arseritters are here already! Come, now, to arms!
   1202700|00000000||Mon-- Monsters! Leg it!
   1206063|00000000||Come back, cowards!
   1202702|00000000||Monsters! Monsters approach!
   1202704|00000000||They've demons with them!
   1202706|00000000||Gods have mercy!
   1203450|00000000||They will kill us all!
   1203452|00000000||Heeeeelp! They'll cut us down!
   1202692|00000000||Something's afoot… We must help them!
   1197218|00000000||Relax. Now we wait.
   1197223|00000000||Ah, our favorite vintner.
   1197226|00000000||It's not him.
   1190048|ef4b0c09||Big Bad Wolf
   1195766|00000000||That Filibert von Wittan, Fourfingers - how did he wind up with the moniker?
   1195768|00000000||He had four fingers.
   1195770|00000000||Well, that's a bumload of help. I know he was missing one. What I don't know is how he lost it.
   1195772|00000000||He didn't talk about it, nearly ever, didn't like to. Once he claimed some wench had bit it off. But he was drunk, so it was probably wishful thinking.
   1193641|00000000||Kill the monsters which have infested the grotto.
   1193642|00000000||Return to your contract giver.
   1193634|00000000||Proceeding on his way, Geralt encountered one in need, as he had many times before. I must emphasize that though ostensibly cool and aloof, the witcher, in fact, has a heart of gold. Thus none should wonder that he agreed to help the anxious vintner. For a modest fee, of course.<br>
   1193635|00000000||Without a moment's hesitation Geralt plunged into the darkness of the Grey Grotto and cut to bits the monsters that had made their lair there…<br>
   1193636|00000000||…For which service he received a generous reward! Then the witcher, his spirits lifted, set off down his Path!<br>

   1165296|00000000||Hey there, handsome!
   1165294|00000000||Ask nicely!
   1155453|00000000||Will you look at that!
   1169890|00000000||Don't see anything here.
   1155455|00000000||These're hoof prints. Not just any old horse's, either. These were left by an astral being, otherworldly. We gotta follow them.
   1155457|00000000||Geralt, look! This here's definitely a clue.
   1155439|00000000||Geralt, we gotta inspect this area closely. I'll look for clues. You stand there and… well, just stand.
   1155441|00000000||Right.
   1164839|00000000||Dead moths - often mean a phantom's nearby.
   1169896|00000000||Thanks, Captain Obvious. Now what about the smell? Same whiff I caught at the cemetery in Vizima, when we were hunting ghouls.
   1191767|00000000||The smell of… death.
   1170128|00000000||Smells normal to me… Not taking me for a ride, are you?
   1194909|00000000||Uh seriously?
   1164841|00000000||All right, now I know what we're up against.
   1176195|00000000||Yes?
   1176193|00000000||Lovely weather.
   1176199|00000000||Criminy, it better not rain.
   1176197|00000000||If it rains, the fields will flood, the vines will absorb, and the wine will turn out watery…

   1144933|00000000||Yaaaawn - huh? What?
   1144937|00000000||Ehh, ahem. Now what will you be needing that blade for, eh?
   1144941|00000000||I'll blow your house down!

   1207196|00000000||<i>It was horrifying to watch... that gentleman suddenly turned into a ghastly beast, with claws, and... tore those men to shreds with the precision of a master butcher…</i> <br>– a witness to Dettlaff's attacks<br><br>Dettlaff is a higher vampire and one of the most terrifying creatures the world has ever known. Some vampires of his sort live among men easily and inconspicuously, sometimes even gaining the respect and admiration of their community. Yet even the most civilized vampire can be incredibly dangerous if provoked, and Dettlaff... Dettlaff was far from civilized.<br><br>When in his two-legged form, Dettlaff strikes in surprising and unique ways, so one must be extremely alert and attentive. His razor-sharp claws, wielded with great strength and precision, are his chief weapons, yet he can also wield weapons of human devising with extraordinary skill.<br><br>Like all higher vampires, Dettlaff can turn into fog and envelop opponents. When fighting a vampire in this form, one must watch out for magic puddles and attacks from the air. When wounded, Detlaff tends to assume his winged form, using these powerful appendages to stun his foes near effortlessly.<br><br>One must remember higher vampires are immortal creatures and thus do not fear for their lives while fighting, meaning they take every risk. They are able to turn invisible and can regenerate strength during combat. All in all, they are supremely difficult foes, even for a witcher.
   1207195|00000000||Dettlaff van der Eretein
   1191110|00000000||Hello-ee!
   1191112|00000000||Hiya!
   1191116|00000000||Mhm?
   1191124|00000000||I've heard of you.
   1191126|00000000||Hahahahahahahahahaha…
   1191128|00000000||Now, now.

   1171570|00000000||Yes? What is it?

   1180960|00000000||You were saying?
   1180962|00000000||Mhm, what, what?
   1201185|00000000||One could put forward the brashly contrarian thesis that a stay in a prison would be a welcome change for a witcher. I know, I know, but bear with me: remember, a witcher spends his entire life, or at least a good part of it, wandering around trackless wildernesses and sleeping with no shelter but a hedgerow or a few bare branches. Therefore, a penal institution, which by definition will have walls, and most likely a roof as well, will at least protect him from strong winds, unexpected morning rains and the droppings of passing birds. Ergo, it would present an upgrade in terms of comfort… though at the price of a downgrade in terms of freedom.<br><br>While becoming intimately acquainted with the charms of prison life, Geralt found a secret stash, used by inmates for purposes of trade.<br>
   1201186|00000000||The witcher puzzled out what to do to use the stash to make a trade. A certain fellow inmate greatly desired a hammer and chisel, having had enough of the prison’s hospitality and wishing to take his leave of the establishment. Geralt placed these objects in the stash, and in return received… a placard.<br>A very interesting placard, in fact. An object of great desire in its own right.
   1208691|00000000||Geralt decided he did not care to check how much a hammer and chisel could fetch in prison currency.
   1201181|00000000||Search for a hammer and chisel.
   1201182|00000000||Hide the hammer and chisel in the stash.
   1201183|00000000||Wait seven days.
   1201184|00000000||Check the prison stash.
   1201193|00000000||Read the notes.

   1162210|00000000||Should've kept it all with you, not left it lying around. Followed some paint tracks to a nekker lair. Seems the beasts made off with your supplies.
   1163313|00000000||Used it to paint a fresco on one of the cave walls. Looked something like a… battle scene to me.
   1162212|00000000||Impossible. They splashed paint on the wall in a rage. Unimportant. In any case, it's a good thing you found the basic colors.
   1163420|00000000||Shall we? While waiting I spied a superior spot.

   1176513|00000000||Tell the birds you're ready to meet Regis.
   1176430|00000000||Return to Orianna.
   1188922|00000000||Meet Regis at the docks.
   1189934|00000000||Geralt had waded through the city's vampire-infested streets to reach Orianna's estate. The vampiress, however, was hardly eager to help the witcher find the Unseen Elder. She was on her way out, about to leave Beauclair for the orphanage she maintained outside the city walls. Anxious about what she might find there, she had neither the time nor the desire nor the patience to listen to the witcher's arguments. Geralt had no choice but to accompany Orianna, hoping to convince her along the way.<br>
   1189935|00000000||Orianna's concerns had been completely justified. One of the vampires Dettlaff had summoned - a garkain, Geralt concluded, based on the clues he found - had perpetrated a bloody massacre. Enraged by what she found, Orianna pledged to help the witcher find the Unseen Elder - on one condition. Geralt had first to bring her the head of her wards' murderer. If I know Geralt, however, he would have hunted the bastard down without the promise of any reward.<br>
   1211061|00000000||Geralt had slain the garkain, but when he rejoined Orianna, he learned the old vampiress was, in fact, not much better than the brute she had asked the witcher to hunt down and kill. Though his hand itched to grab the hilt of his silver sword once more and tend to Orianna as he had tended to the garkain, he was well aware saving the city's inhabitants was far more important at the time. Nonetheless, I suspect the witcher and the vampiress will meet again one day…<br>
   1211064|00000000||As the witcher met once more with Regis, two possible paths lay before him. He now had to choose between meeting with the Unseen Elder or finding Syanna.<br>

   1156416|00000000||Leaping Lebioda! We're saved! My hero.
   1200476|00000000||No hero. Just a witcher. Slaying monsters is my job.
   1200478|00000000||Brave and humble! Oh, my! Oh ho hooo…!
   1156425|00000000||Run this vineyard all by our lonesome?
   1156427|00000000||Ooh, no… My father's the vintner. Oh, an excellent one, too. I merely help out.
   1198889|00000000||So where's your father?
   1198891|00000000||In the hospital, after he was wounded by those monsters. But he gets better by the day!
   1156420|00000000||You run the vineyard alone?
   1156429|00000000||Take care.
   1200498|00000000||Please do stop in if you're ever around.
   1156421|00000000||Farewell.
   1156419|00000000||What've you got to trade?
   1156423|00000000||What're you offering, what can I buy?
   1200484|00000000||The best herbs in all Toussaint!
   1156418|00000000||Hail, my hero.
   1198887|00000000||Witcher! Hero! Come visit with me!
   1198300|00000000||Our duquessa…
   1198302|00000000||What now? Without our duchess…?
   1178117|00000000||Eat, drink and be merry! Thus spake the Prophet Lebioda!
   1178119|00000000||The duquessa! Our sweet shining sun!
   1178121|00000000||Where's the fire?!
   1178123|00000000||Someone please summon the Guard!
   1198304|00000000||Yes? What?
   1178127|00000000||He-llo!
   1178125|00000000||Kindest regards.

   1191040|00000000||Never thought I'd live to see times like these.
   1191042|00000000||I can't believe it. I simply can't.
   1191050|00000000||Sigh…
   1191044|00000000||Master witcher?
   1191046|00000000||Yeees?
   1191048|00000000||Ah yes, good day.
   1191052|00000000||Well, well, Geralt of Rivia in the flesh.
   1191054|00000000||Ah, sorry.
   1191056|00000000||Watch out!
   1191058|00000000||Someone help me!
   1201127|00000000||Oh, witcher, greetings! Kind of you to come. Matilda and I, we've a surprise for you.
   1201125|00000000||See you're doing well.
   1201129|00000000||Hm. You two seem to be getting along.
   1201131|00000000||We are. There came a point we realized we had no grounds to quarrel. Things became altogether… pleasant.
   1201133|00000000||And a bit spicy.
   1201135|00000000||Romantic. Quite.
   1201137|00000000||Got it. Needn't say more. Glad things're going well for you.
   1201124|00000000||What's this surprise?
   1201139|00000000||Butcher of Blaviken.
   1201152|00000000||Maybe… Butcher of Blaviken?
   1201154|00000000||A strong name. I like it!
   1201140|00000000||White Wolf.
   1201156|00000000||Why not… White Wolf.
   1201158|00000000||Wild, with character! It fits perfectly!
   1201146|00000000||If you wouldn't mind, we'd like to send a few bottles to your home every so often.
   1201148|00000000||I'd be honored, thanks.
   1201150|00000000||No, we thank you. Take care, witcher.
   1201142|00000000||Call it… Geralt of Rivia.
   1201144|00000000||Geralt de Rivia! Perfect!
   1201138|00000000||Geralt of Rivia.
   1201113|00000000||What's the surprise? Some new monster I need to kill?
   1201115|00000000||No, something far more pleasant.
   1201117|00000000||We've produced a wine. According to the best sommeliers, it might just dethrone Est Est.
   1201119|00000000||We owe this success to you, so if you'd agree…
   1201121|00000000||We'd like to name it after you.
   1201123|00000000||What shall we call it?
   1205435|00000000||Witcher! A word! We've got something for you! It will only take a moment, I promise.
   1202258|00000000||Naughty kiddies!
   1202260|00000000||I'll teach you to misbehave!
   1202262|00000000||Hoo hoo ha!
   1188599|00000000||Watch it.
   1188603|00000000||The Butcher of Blaviken called to be the savior of Toussaint? Interesting…
   1188607|00000000||You ought to rot in chains, witcher.
   1188605|00000000||They say a great deal about you, witcher. And whisper even more.
   1188601|00000000||We all trusted you, witcher. You let us down.
   1199004|00000000||Please, good folk! I've nothing of value! It's but a piece of a monument!
   1199008|00000000||Save me, sir! Help!
   1199010|00000000||Saint Lebioda sent you! I must now repair my wagon. They await me at the building site!
   1188613|00000000||Leave me in peace, witcher.
   1188609|00000000||Greetings.
    360354|00000000||So long.
   1188611|00000000||Do not force me to summon the guardsmen!
   1191883|00000000||Any tidin's?
   1191891|00000000||Fuckin' hell. That's some heavy shit.
   1191887|00000000||Ah fuck…
   1191885|00000000||Whoa! What's all this… Relax, mate!
   1191889|00000000||Smash your gob!
   1168461|00000000||I beg your pardon! That I wish to make my beloved's name known the world over, to bring her glo--
   1168504|00000000||Find some other way to prove your valor. Only thing you've proven so far is that you're a fool.
   1168507|00000000||You do not mince words, master. In Toussaint one might demand satisfaction upon trampled ground for a lesser slight.
   1179584|00000000||Yet… there is truth in what you say, I cannot deny. I survived with my life by a hair. It is time… time I returned home.
   1168502|00000000||Wanna prove your valor? Go back to your betrothed and be honest, tell her you're not ready to marry.
   1168500|00000000||Shut up and listen. Crests, scrap metal armor, swooning damsels - all that's nothing to do with hunting monsters. Which is work, damn hard, dangerous and thankless work - that you're just not cut out for.
   1168470|00000000||You are blind to my predicament. Once I return, I will have no recourse. She will drag me to the nearest shrine, while--
   1168459|00000000||Take my advice - grab the damned head and cut the shit.
   1168435|00000000||Take the damned head, go back to Beauclair.
   1168463|00000000||Uh, can't say I see it happening, your success. But do what you will. And good luck.
   1168465|00000000||My thanks, master. To fight at your side was an honor.
   1168467|00000000||Mhh… Must have really cold feet. Frozen.
   1168436|00000000||Whatever. If you don't want the trophy, I'll take it.
   1168432|00000000||High time you returned to Beauclair, brave knight.
   1106023|00000000||Nay, oh nay. The head of this beast is a trifle, wholly inadequate to express the love I harbor for my betrothed.
   1168434|00000000||The world awaits! Ahem. To honor her, I shall cut down another, more terrible beast!
   1105962|00000000||Time to head back to Beauclair.
   1105983|00000000||Why not choose a less fearsome beast?
   1105986|00000000||Why the challenge? Couldn’t 'ave gone after a something less formidable? A werebbubb, for instance?
   1105989|00000000||Why? For… for the beast must match in ferocity the very ardor of my affection, and…
   1105991|00000000||You're blushing, sir knight.
   1106015|00000000||Agh… It's my betrothed. The thing is, she champs at the bit to get married, when we've not known one another but two years!
   1138424|00000000||So I vowed to slay Grottore. Thought it would buy me time. To battle such a beast, why, it could take months…
   1106017|00000000||Mhm. Especially at the rate you were going…
   1152393|00000000||Please, you must accept this trifle… as a token of my gratitude.
   1105953|00000000||Ughh… Ooph… By my troth, the damned brute was sturdy!
   1152335|00000000||I… I'm grateful, witcher. You aided me greatly.
   1198927|00000000||You're looking well, top form, my dear! Cheeks ruddy as strawberries, smile wide as a watermelon!
   1198929|00000000||Oh, you rogue! But it's true, I do feel better. Now that peace has come to the cemetery, I sleep well at long last.
   1198931|00000000||That witcher from the North, he cleaned the place out.
   1186405|00000000||Why so pale? Are you well?
   1195513|00000000||No… I've trouble sleeping…
   1195515|00000000||Ahah, the pitter-patter of little feet…
   1195517|00000000||Were it only that… I live near the cemetery. Every night I awake to screams, bloodcurdling cries. Ghosts, no doubt.
   1195519|00000000||Come, don't be foolish. It must be the drunks from the auberge nearby.
   1182388|00000000||It's not bad, is it? In other words, it could be worse!
   1182386|00000000||{Fion, maerche! Toussaint!} [Wine, women! Toussaint!]
   1182390|00000000||Hey, now!
   1182392|00000000||{Vatt'ghern?} [Witcher?]
   1055096|472fdbf5||Girl
   1126337|00000000||To honor our entrants, praise each fair knight, we shall feast from eve till dawn's first light! The finest of wine and food shall be served, if you've blood in your veins, come collect what's deserved!
   1182344|00000000||I congratulate you. Here, your prize. A saddle adorned with your crest.
   1182346|00000000||Many thanks.
   1182348|00000000||By the way… my maid saw a man with white hair sneak out of my tent. Would you know who it might have been?
   1182350|00000000||No idea.
   1205086|00000000||How juvenile.
   1126342|00000000||A failure, a loss, a tragic trip - let us hope with his sword he makes no such slip.
   1126344|00000000||Come with me to the feast. We shall await Vivienne together, wine in hand.
   1188577|00000000||Lead the way.
   1126346|00000000||Congratulations on your win! In stellar style, no less! Ahh, I no longer regret I was not able to participate - almost!
   1201863|00000000||We must drink to this, come with me to the feast. We shall await Vivienne together.
   1201865|00000000||Lead the way.
   1126340|00000000||A race of such style, such grace, such speed - to watch was a pleasure, a treat, indeed!
   1191802|00000000||You've shown great valor, so much we ought to have witchers errant, not knights! None of that lot came forth to help us!
   1166389|00000000||It should be right around here.
   1184883|00000000||Vampires walked a dusty trail, "Oh, how boring," they would wail.
   1184885|00000000||Bored to tears, bored to death! Soon but one vampire was left. This last one, small and withered, shoved an onion down his gizzard!
   1184881|00000000||Pyew! Stinky!
   1184889|00000000||Yes?
   1184887|00000000||Bye, baby Bunting, papa's gone a-hunting!

   1162773|00000000||Listen, good folk! Listen here! Would you spare a copper?
   1162775|00000000||A coin, or I'll spew on your boots.
   1175530|00000000||Not frightened of a vampire? Really?
   1175538|00000000||A higher vampire and you were unimpressed? Don't know if that's brave or just plain foolish.
   1175540|00000000||I've always had a way with ostensibly dangerous quiet types.
   1175542|00000000||That supposed to about me, too?
   1175548|00000000||Oh bother - I hate to disappoint you, Geralt, but your belly button is not the center of the known world. Though, you do remind me of him a bit - stifling all emotions inside you, ever feigning indifference.
   1175572|00000000||You see, when I met Dettlaff, I… somehow I knew - call it intuition - that he meant me no harm. That he was trying to frighten me off for he, too, was scared. Now do you understand?
   1175585|00000000||I guess.
   1154040|00000000||It's time to go. Just a bit more work and we'll be able to say sod off to this fecking Fablesphere.
   1154042|00000000||It's time we moved on. Come.
   1175577|00000000||Got a history with Dettlaff, now, so this meeting'll be different. Not afraid?
   1175579|00000000||I can handle him.
   1175581|00000000||Mhm. Sure about that?
   1175583|00000000||You look at him as a witcher and see a monster. I… I know what he's really like. You needn't worry.
   1175505|00000000||Not afraid to meet Dettlaff?
   1175506|00000000||Aimed to use him from the start?
   1175508|00000000||To use him - was that your plan from the start?
   1175510|00000000||No. At first I was simply intrigued. Do you know the story?
   1175515|00000000||It was in Metinna, a few years past. I'd gone there to pass some loot off to a fence I know.
   1175517|00000000||We were hashing out the terms, when in walked Dettlaff. He said he'd come to sell a silver candlestick. He gripped it through a cloth. That caught my eye.
   1175519|00000000||I followed him out, observed him from a distance… but he caught on quickly.
   1175521|00000000||Yeah. Superhuman senses'll do that.
   1175523|00000000||He turned down a blind alley. I followed. He jumped out from behind a crate, baring his teeth. I suppose he'd wanted to frighten me… Alas, he didn't in the least. After all, I'm a monster too, am I not?
   1175524|00000000||What happened then?
   1175532|00000000||What happened then?
   1175534|00000000||We talked. Then met up - once, twice, three times… enough that he became infatuated.
   1175536|00000000||I truly enjoyed it at first. But only at first. He did not love like a man, but like an animal. Madly, deeply, unconditionally. Wildly.
   1175558|00000000||To return such a feeling - anyone would be hard pressed… Let alone someone as twisted as I am.
   1175560|00000000||So, there came a day you just up and disappeared.
   1175562|00000000||Yes. There was no other way. "Let's just be friends," or "I don't deserve you" - he'd never have understood that sort of thing.
   1175564|00000000||But then, once I'd decided to return, clean up some old affairs… I remembered him. And concluded he could still be of use.
   1175566|00000000||Playing with fire, that.
   1175568|00000000||Definitely. And either I'll get burned, or I'll burn all else down. No other options.
   1152576|00000000||So?
   1154038|00000000||Got the bean, but Longlocks… hm. Seems she got sick of waiting for a knight in shining armor.
   1167337|00000000||Can you blame her? Men these days… dandies and fops, all.
   1175498|00000000||That why you cozied up to a vampire?
   1175500|00000000||Dettlaff… was a tool. And only a tool.
   1175502|00000000||Too bad he didn't know that.
   1175504|00000000||I trust no one. Learned that long ago. Now it's his turn.
   1208533|e3605a49||Handsome Jacques
   1195586|00000000||Elekheshebh, sarabah durendum!
   1195588|00000000||Kalabathi sta!
   1199032|00000000||Sabeshkehee, beshkehee, kha!
   1195582|00000000||Look at the mage! I believe he's casting spells.
   1195584|00000000||Yeah… we'll see.
   1195594|00000000||The dolphins… that is no ordinary illusion . The man is a true artist.
   1195596|00000000||Mhm… impressive.
   1195603|00000000||Ah, how beautiful…
   1208889|acc7239c||Barber
   1185295|00000000||Never, ever trust a woman! Remember that!
   1185293|00000000||Every single lady keeps a devil somewhere shady!
   1185297|00000000||We live in foul times, foul, I say!
   1185299|00000000||Eh, blast my bum with a ballista!
   1194539|00000000||Akh akh akh akh!
   1194542|00000000||Sweet mother of man…
   1194546|00000000||Deliver us from evil…
   1194544|00000000||What?
   1194548|00000000||Oh, you don't mean to!
   1194550|00000000||Don't do it!
   1194552|00000000||Good folk, help!
   1191842|00000000||They scoffed at you, a migrant from the North, but if you hadn't come, they'd still be wetting their britches with fear! Thanks, sugarpuss!
   1202196|00000000||Greetin's, witcher.
   1202198|00000000||I've heard so much about you, witcher.
    336175|d2589ac1||Florist
   1179158|00000000||Curses, try to surround him!
   1179160|00000000||Nooooooooo!
   1195605|00000000||You nit, you louse, you cur! You slaughtered Starling Straggen's hanse?!
   1179164|00000000||Saintly scrotch! He's fast!
   1179166|00000000||It was that close!! That bloody close!!
   1179168|00000000||I shall kill you. Know why? Because I'm bored.
   1179162|00000000||Crikeys! Help!
   1179170|00000000||Blimey, twoot-sniffer's fast!
   1179172|00000000||Ooph, crikey!
   1210195|00000000||Can't sightsee, can't get lost. More and more folk dying every minute. Need to tend to the vampires - them and Dettlaff.
   1210198|00000000||Ugh… Healing potion… gotta drink one.
   1210262|00000000||Dammit. Lost some gear… Ugh… Need to find it.
   1211058|00000000||Wounds're bad… Least it didn't suffer long.
   1210193|00000000||Gotta get back and stop Dettlaff.
   1199029|00000000||I thank you for your help, witcher…
   1189282|00000000||But what if he doesn't come?
   1189284|00000000||He'll definitely come. Don't worry.
   1189286|00000000||How can you be so sure?
   1189288|00000000||Brother dearest… trust me. He promised me he'd meet with you, and so he will.
   1189276|00000000||Are they even? Because the right cuff seems somewhat higher to me…
   1189278|00000000||It's fine, relax. Master Bouvaux is a generous patron and a truly wonderful man.
   1189280|00000000||It was thanks to him I had that exhibition in the palace gardens…
   1189510|00000000||Was that not just after you went off with him to Belhaven for a week?
   1189512|00000000||Ehh… well…
   1189514|00000000||Exactly. I would rather not go anywhere with him, so I must make a good impression.
   1186688|00000000||Defeating the Beast, it was undeniably a feat. But to get Liam and Matilda to bury the hatchet…!
   1186686|00000000||Smashing work, witcher. To take down the Beast…
   1186684|00000000||Women love tears, men prefer wine.
   1186682|00000000||A bottle of wine's enough for two, provided one's not drinking.
   1186690|00000000||But… whatever… What's the problem?!
   1197108|00000000||Not bad…
   1197106|00000000||And you believe this tripe?
   1197114|00000000||So it turned out Count Crespi incited the feud between Coronata and Vermentino. Hehe. Sly old goat… May he rest in peace!
   1197112|00000000||In the North there's a land, Velen it's called, where bellies are pinched so tight, folk don't drink wine, distilling instead hooch from tree bark and old boot lacings!
   1197110|00000000||And Madame de Bourbeau, it seems, was letting some filthy farmhand mow her grass! They went at it so loud, old Bourbeau thought he had a monster in the cellar!
   1186696|00000000||Give this man some wine!
   1186692|00000000||Hey there!
   1186694|00000000||Whoa, friend! Calm down!
   1213849|b4b15713||Patient
   1209552|00000000||Hep-shoop, tam tah ree ree, hep-shoop!
   1209550|00000000||Long live Duquessa Anna Henrietta!
   1209548|00000000||A tip of the hat to the tourney's victor.
   1209554|00000000||Now! All together!
   1209558|00000000||You sow-shagging scallywag!
   1209560|00000000||You're refuse! Swine will not eat you!
   1209562|00000000||Trah-la-fudgy-la!
   1209556|00000000||We'll teach you discipline!
   1209564|00000000||You're done for, murderer!
   1209566|00000000||What's the meaning of this? Well, witcher?!
   1209568|00000000||We can do it!
   1209570|00000000||The blade - put it away, witcher.
   1209572|00000000||Fairground trickery!
   1209574|00000000||Your choice. Come here!
   1209576|00000000||That's better!
   1209580|00000000||Yes, witcher?
   1209578|00000000||Talk to the commander.
   1191941|00000000||Where you walkin'?!
   1191943|00000000||C'mon, you fuck, try it!
   1191945|00000000||Lebioda wept…
   1157222|00000000||Praised be our Lord Lebioda! You come in his name, you are his avatar!
   1177516|00000000||Nope, just a witcher who happened to be passing through…
   1177518|00000000||By the Prophet's intervention! He was your guide, he nudged your footsteps here!
   1177520|00000000||If you say so…
   1177522|00000000||What shall we call you, hero?
   1177524|00000000||I'm Geralt. Geralt of Rivia.
   1177526|00000000||Geralt… Lovely it rings! Sacred it sounds. Do you thirst? Or hunger?
   1157231|00000000||Know much of the local history? Found a few elven scrolls while wandering around in the area…
   1157233|00000000||…
   1177528|00000000||These notes… they describe what happened to the elves who used to live here in Fox Hollow…
   1177530|00000000||I know nothing. Now would like ought to eat, or to drink?
   1157226|00000000||Found some strange notes nearby…
   1157235|00000000||Take care, now.
   1177532|00000000||You are sorely missed already!
   1157227|00000000||Farewell.
   1157225|00000000||Show me what you have.
   1157229|00000000||Hm. Lemme see what you're serving.
   1157224|00000000||Geralt of Rivia! Our savior!
   1209303|00000000||Milton and Palmerin? Here? Came a hell of a long way to see me.
   1209305|00000000||Need to find them, learn what they want.
   1175094|00000000||Sir knights, leave us be, we beg ye!
   1175096|00000000||I's afeared!
   1175098|00000000||We ain't in need o' no 'elp!
   1175088|00000000||You have suffered enough plunder! Enough rape!
   1175099|00000000||Fear not, for we shall spill only the blood of outlaws - to you, we grant liberation!
   1195435|00000000||{Ekh, ekh, ekh…}
   1195437|00000000||{Hrrrr..}
   1195439|00000000||Ptooey.
   1187740|00000000||Truly honored.
   1187747|00000000||Feels like a… second distinction, I'm honored. Thank you.
   1187751|00000000||I trust you shall make good use of it.
   1198498|00000000||Got bad news - Syanna was out to kill you.
   1198502|00000000||I am, and truly grateful, Your Grace… Sadly, I'm afraid I have to sour the mood.
   1198505|00000000||It's Syanna… she plotted to have you killed, Duchess. Planned to use Dettlaff. You were to be the Beast's fifth victim.
   1198508|00000000||This cannot be true. You're mistaken! You must be!
   1198510|00000000||I have proof.
   1198530|00000000||I do not believe it.
   1198528|00000000||You returned my sister to me, yet you also showed me her horrendous deeds.
   1198522|00000000||As head of state, I must judge her fairly. But she is my sister, thus my heart bleeds for her…
   1177130|00000000||Free to do as I choose.
   1177157|00000000||I'm not a prisoner. Free to do as I choose.
   1177133|00000000||Syanna's clearly guilty. That's all that matters.
   1177146|00000000||You Grace, Syanna's guilt is clear. None have cause to doubt it. But before you decide, you should hear her out. The right to a defense is hers, as it applies to all who stand accused.
   1177137|00000000||Your Grace, as head of state you should look first and foremost after your dominion.
   1181350|00000000||Syanna's actions, what drove them, be damned. She's a threat to your subjects.
   1188932|00000000||You are correct. They are what matters. I must not forget this.
   1198497|00000000||The good of the duchy, that's what matters most.
   1198496|00000000||Syanna should be punished like any criminal.
   1177141|00000000||No matter the mitigating circumstances, whatever they may be, Syanna is a criminal and should be tried as such.
   1181346|00000000||And punished as such. Her guilt is clear.
   1188928|00000000||Your words sadden me greatly, witcher, but I cannot deny their logic.
   1177187|00000000||Syanna… You shall be tried and given a fitting punishment. Yet we shall never cease to be family.
   1177189|00000000||As duchess, I shall have to judge you. But as your sister, I shall never stop loving you.
   1208013|00000000||Will you forgive me?
   1214927|00000000||I shall never forgive you.
   1208015|00000000||I'm sorry, dear sister… Can you forgive me?
   1192025|00000000||You were children, then. You and your sister both. Had no control over what happened.
   1192042|00000000||You're wrong, witcher. She had control. Remember, dear sister, the day they banished me from the palace?
   1191988|00000000||Of course, I'd had the idea to pelt the Nilfgaardian envoy with fish bladders… which we filled with rancid suet on a lark.
   1191990|00000000||And which you set afire at the last. To impress me, I imagine. And I admit you did. Hit him right in his hideous bald patch!
   1191992|00000000||Never laughed so hard in my life… But when it came time to find the culprit, you said not a word. I took all the blame and all the punishment.
   1191994|00000000||It's true… I did not stand up for you. I was too afraid…
   1192067|00000000||The council was unanimous. They listed all my offences - my flights from the palace, supposed acts of cruelty, "inappropriate" friendships…
   1192044|00000000||They cast me out… But you! The only one to understand me… you cowered in a corner, lifted not a finger to help. Not before, not after. You never tried to find me.
   1192001|00000000||That's not true. I searched for you! Sent out knights, gathered tidings from without… You did not wish to be found.
   1198556|00000000||Since the day you vanished, I have lived with the knowledge that I failed you.
   1191986|00000000||You were children then, both.
   1192098|00000000||Claim to understand all those you detested? Had killed?
   1192100|00000000||Claim to understand them all? Why'd you come back for revenge? Have them all cut down, then?
   1192102|00000000||They deserved my vengeance! They detested me, all of them, as long as I can remember! But Anarietta understood me. Once.
   1192104|00000000||She was all I could cling to… Her betrayal hurt the most.
   1177179|00000000||What is he talking about, Syanna?
   1177149|00000000||You know exactly what! I was forcibly exiled, remember? To your benefit. You knew well the throne would then be yours, though I was the elder!
   1191978|00000000||The ministers I can understand. They'd hated me since I was a child, thought me a poor prospect for the wife of a duke.
   1191983|00000000||I even understand our parents. I'd always sensed the problem - they simply feared me! For I dared to be free! That fabricated curse, it fell into their laps, a gift from above that brought relief. But you?!
   1191985|00000000||Your dagger hurt most. You were my Anarietta, dammit! My darling little sister! Now do you understand, witcher?! She betrayed me!
   1177144|00000000||Bitterness consumes Syanna. She had cause to resent many of the court of Beauclair. I know her reasons, understand them, even.
   1177159|00000000||But I can't condone the actions she chose to take.
   1177132|00000000||Syanna's crimes were horrible, but she had cause to feel pain.
   1198547|00000000||Thus I have asked Geralt to advise me, as one impartial. I shall now hear what he has to say.
   1198549|00000000||Nor does it let me believe you sought my demise. My heart yearns to know you were swayed by the monster Dettlaff. You yourself would never stoop so low.
   1177152|00000000||You have committed crimes, grave crimes. Yet you are my sister and my heart does not allow me to treat you as a common criminal.
   1177155|00000000||The duchess requested I be present.
   1177129|00000000||Duchess asked me to stay.
   1177126|00000000||The witcher will take part in our talk?
   1198512|00000000||If my presence'll help in any manner, of course I'll stay.
   1198514|00000000||We shall now question a person implicated in the murders which recently ravaged our fair city of Beauclair. Captain de la Tour, show Sylvia Anna in.
   1198524|00000000||You returned my sister to me, yet what you tell me now I find devastating. I've come to doubt that I can judge her fairly… I'd far prefer to learn you're mistaken, Geralt.
   1198526|00000000||I'm not. In fact, I'd recommend you be particularly careful around her.
   1207159|00000000||You exaggerate, witcher. She is my sister. I know well how to speak to her.
   1161532|00000000||In a moment I shall speak to Syanna. Will you assist me?
   1187743|00000000||Yes. Very. Heard a lot of good things about that appellation. Thanks again.
   1187745|00000000||Cheers.
   1187739|00000000||Can't wait.
   1187708|00000000||In more familiar terms, now, I thank you immensely, Geralt. Damien has your reward for you. After all, it was but a contract.
   1187714|00000000||Thank you.
   1187716|00000000||I've a small surprise for you, in addition. I give you more than a dozen barrels of Sangreal, a wine normally reserved for the ducal table.
   1187738|00000000||The gustatory experience of a lifetime awaits! Are you content?
   1192252|00000000||Geralt of Rivia, slayer of the Beast of Beauclair, step forth. Ahem!
   1192255|00000000||We bestow the distinction upon the witcher who saved Beauclair from the terrible Beast. Such is our desire.
   1192257|00000000||May this symbol serve as a reminder to all that the witcher shall forever remain a friend of Beauclair.
   1177824|00000000||In the guild's name, I beg your assistance, Your Enlightened Highness. Without barrels, production will come to a stop, and it will be the end of us.
   1180977|00000000||You lost them all in the fire? These are horrible tidings. We are most dreadfully saddened.
   1177826|00000000||Yes, Your Enlightened Highness, all. Once the beasts had clawed their way into the warehouse, the whole place went up in flames.
   1177828|00000000||I shall dispatch a palace guardsman to examine the site of the blaze. If things are as you say, fitting compensation shall be paid from the ducal treasury.
   1177830|00000000||Thank you, Your Enlightened Highness.
   1180992|00000000||Your Grace. Geralt of Rivia has arrived.
   1184940|00000000||My dear subjects! We come now to our next point of business. Of all the duties which fall upon my shoulders as the ruler of this dominion, this duty is dearest to my heart.
   1185879|00000000||For now, we shall award the Order of Vitis Vinifera, Toussaint's highest honor.
   1124379|00000000||I need Permit A38. Any chance you could issue me a copy?
   1135262|00000000||Fiddlesticks, I've just run out.
   1135264|00000000||Wait… really?
   1135266|00000000||Of course not! In truth, I've never had anything of the sort! This is the archive!
   1124065|00000000||Need Permit A38.
   1124392|00000000||Listen, say I made a small donation? To a certain member of the bank's staff?
   1124394|00000000||A bribe, sir? How dare you?! I truly cannot help! This is the archive.
   1124068|00000000||Any chance we can make a deal?
   1124381|00000000||That'll be all, thanks.
   1124383|00000000||Yes, yes, it's what they always say…
   1138582|00000000||And once you're upstairs, do tell them not to send every lost fool with a problem to me! I've work to do!
   1124069|00000000||Farewell.
   1124066|00000000||Looking for Form 202.
   1124406|00000000||Form 202… I could use a copy.
   1135268|00000000||Why come to me for a form at all? I have none. This is the archive. I've nothing you need and cannot help you.
   1124389|00000000||What is it? Folk are hard at work here.
   1186057|00000000||Knife - have you heard of such a thing?
   1186055|00000000||Fork - does the word mean anything to you?
   1186061|00000000||What a specimen… He scared the fright out of me!
   1186059|00000000||The North must be a terribly barbaric land…
   1093892|00000000||He shall perish in there if we don't help!
   1171744|00000000||Come scratch my danglies!
   1171742|00000000||Ehh, shod off…
   1193346|00000000||She give you some? Eh? For driving off the Beast?
   1171748|00000000||When the clock strikes six, ladies start to work their lips!
   1171746|00000000||Hey, Blondie! Who blows your porridge when the bears're out to forage?
   1124608|00000000||Greetings. Wanna join the lists.
   1124610|00000000||Naturally. We must first see to formalities, however. At Guillaume's request I have looked into your personal history in its heraldic aspects.
   1130943|00000000||Really. What'd you come up with?
   1124612|00000000||My findings show you may take part as Geralt of Rivia…
   1130945|00000000||What a surprise.
   1130947|00000000||Or as the honorable Ravix of Fourhorn. It's not every year we have a combatant who can boast of two crests! Which do you prefer?
   1124605|00000000||What'd you learn about Geralt of Rivia?
   1124614|00000000||Kinda curious what you could've learned about Geralt of Rivia.
   1124616|00000000||In the year 1267 a certain Geralt, a member of the witchers' guild, was knighted by Queen Meve and dubbed Geralt of Rivia.
   1130950|00000000||This was in honor of his distinguished service at the Battle of the Bridge, said structure spanning the Yaruga. But I wager you know of which battle I speak?
   1130952|00000000||Mhhh, yeah… Those were the days. Cahir and I led a fistful of Nordlings against an entire Nilfgaardian battalion. Won that battle just because we absolutely had to cross the river.
   1124606|00000000||What'd you dig up about Ravix of Fourhorn?
   1124632|00000000||Ravix of Fourhorn? How'd you manage to dig that up?
   1124634|00000000||Here in Toussaint, we treat heraldry very seriously. One visit to the Ducal Archives - that is all I needed to acquire the necessary information.
   1156914|00000000||"Ravix of Fourhorn" was the name under which you attended a feast honoring Princess Pavetta, daughter of Queen Calanthe of Cintra, on the occasion of her fifteenth birthday.
   1130954|00000000||That's actually right.
   1124619|00000000||The honorable Ravix will do.
   1124604|00000000||I'll be Sir Ravix of Fourhorn, but just for the tourney.
   1124603|00000000||Wanna join as Geralt of Rivia.
   1124602|00000000||I'm Geralt. Not about to fight under a false name.
   1201673|00000000||You may now take the shield bearing your crest.
   1201675|00000000||I'm a witcher. Shields aren't something witchers ever use in combat.
   1201677|00000000||Who mentioned using it in combat? Not I. The shield commemorates your participation in the tourney. You may take it as a souvenir.
   1201687|00000000||Hm. In that case, thanks.
   1185164|00000000||Have you been instructed as to the tourney's challenges, prizes and vows? If not, I do hope you will allow me to tell you about them.
   1185167|00000000||The challenges - tell me about them.
   1188525|00000000||Guillaume told me a bit about the contests. Rather make sure I'm clear on them, though.
   1129818|00000000||An admirable thirst for knowledge! There are contests three. A shooting range, where you will compete side by side with an opponent.
   1129820|00000000||A horse race, during which you will seek to complete the course within a specified time. Any targets hit with bolts or dummies felled with blade will increase the time you have.
   1129822|00000000||Finally, the group melee in the arena, crowned with a duel against last year's champion.
   1201683|00000000||As each contest ends, its results will be posted on the board outside my tent. This way all will be apprised of who leads at any given moment.
   1201685|00000000||Convenient.
   1185169|00000000||Vows - what's that about?
   1188521|00000000||You say something about vows?
   1124598|00000000||As is our custom, knights make vows to which they hold for the duration of the tourney. Each swears on something which to him represents his most cherished virtue.
   1185168|00000000||I'd like to learn more about the prizes.
   1188523|00000000||Gonna come right out with it - I'm a sucker for prizes.
   1173160|00000000||The winner of each contest shall receive a trophy.
   1173162|00000000||Whoever has the best result once all contests have played out shall face last year's champion in a final duel for glory and the title.
   1173164|00000000||Should you defeat the reigning champion, the grand prize will be yours. This year - a sword forged especially for this occasion by the one and only Cornelius of Assengard, a famed master weaponsmith.
   1192904|00000000||Her Illustrious Highness had it brought all the way from Nazair.
   1185177|00000000||Know all I need to.
   1185179|00000000||Feels like I know everything I'd ever want to know about chivalric tourneys.
   1185181|00000000||Splendid. In that case, you must make your vow. Upon what would you like to swear it?
   1124590|00000000||I'll swear on my lady's love.
   1157244|00000000||I vow on the love of my lady, whose name I choose not to divulge, to respect the chivalric virtues.
   1157218|00000000||I vow on the love of my lady, Yennefer of Vengerberg, to respect the chivalric virtues.
   1157220|00000000||I vow on the love of my lady, Triss Merigold, to respect the chivalric virtues.
   1124592|00000000||Rather not make any vow.
   1124630|00000000||Don't feel like making a vow.
   1157285|00000000||Custom allows even for this possibility.
   1157283|00000000||May the gods succor you in your endeavors to overcome. Sign here, please, then fill out these forms.
   1124624|00000000||That is all I need from you. Now, as arranged by Guillaume, you shall be fitted with appropriate armor for the tourney.
   1194969|00000000||Hm. Shiny.
   1130974|00000000||You have also been assigned a tent for the tourney's duration. It stands near the arena. Good luck!
   1124588|00000000||I solemnly vow on the heron that in competing I'll respect the chivalric virtues.
   1124589|00000000||I'll swear on the heron.
   1124591|00000000||I'll swear on Her Illustrious Highness' garter.
   1124628|00000000||I swear on Her Grace's illustrious garter to respect the chivalric virtues in competing.
   1208712|5a39f461||Beast of Beauclair
   1181264|00000000||Fair skies and two fathoms beneath your hull!
   1181266|00000000||Overhung? You look pale.
   1181270|00000000||Red, white, rosé…
   1181268|00000000||Achoo! A sneeze of that size deserves a drink!
   1135144|00000000||Got a problem with my account…
   1135147|00000000||Got a problem with my account. Wanted to withdraw some coin, see, but…
   1135149|00000000||Nae problem there, we'll get ye paid up in a jiffy! Just gonnae need tae settle yon tiny wee trifle…
   1135151|00000000||Heard that already. Permit A38, among others…
   1140356|00000000||Mah hands're tied without them, Geralt. But I see ye're a quick learner in the ways o' banking. Ye'll get them in a heartbeat.
   1135486|00000000||Ye tell 'em – dinnae disturb, but no… Always some bugger wha cannae stand tae wait.
   1140059|00000000||Plough me, who's this?! Hearty greetin's, master Geralt. Ye havenae paid us a visit in eons.
   1135156|00000000||Been a bit busy. But I'm back now, and I need your help with something.
   1135158|00000000||Course. Now do tell, how can I help ye?
   1135490|00000000||Master Geralt, how can I be o' service?
   1153810|00000000||Cianfanelli, no more excuses. Pay out my coin. Now.
   1153812|00000000||C'mon, master witcher, fir wye the ire?! There's nae need! We'll have it all for ye, just need tae see the necessary documents.
   1153814|00000000||Got a document right here means a hell of a lot more than any of your forms or permits. Have a look.
   1153816|00000000||H… Her Enlightened Highness… she's hired ye?
   1177860|00000000||Mhm. And as her personal emissary, I demand access to my account. Right now.
   1177862|00000000||A… Aye, master witcher. This way.
   1153753|00000000||No more excuses. What happened to my coin?
   1135145|00000000||I'll come back.
   1135160|00000000||Look in on you later.
   1135162|00000000||We're here to serve! And if ye've a matter for a high heid yin, make a beeline to yers truly!
   1177690|00000000||Greetings.
   1177692|00000000||Forgive me, I'm occupied.
   1198853|00000000||We… I… Thank you.
   1198851|00000000||You! You've the look of a knight! Over there! Monsters have come!
   1198849|00000000||You! Hey! With the blades on your back! Help us! Look! Monsters all about!
   1177694|00000000||Why must you push?!
   1177698|00000000||Layabouts, wonks, sluggards, skivers…
   1177696|00000000||Up to our necks in work, yet they had to drink themselves sick!
   1198845|00000000||What? Come to spy for Coronata?
   1177700|00000000||Calm yourself!
   1198847|00000000||To me, witcher, you've the stench of a Vermentino spy about you.
   1186884|00000000||Well, I never!
   1186882|00000000||The monster slayer!
   1186888|00000000||Witcher… you, I am sure, are no diddle-footed dancer.
   1186886|00000000||The witcher's not nearly as nasty as they make him out to be.
   1201458|00000000||Once you're lips have touched Geralt of Rivia, you will never cheat on it with another wine!
   1176772|f20861fc||Bear Cub
   1172809|00000000||Lebioda guide you!
   1172811|00000000||Witcher?
   1198485|00000000||A good thing you were in town when we were attacked by those… vampires.
   1172813|00000000||A witcher. The perfect killing device.
   1172815|00000000||Half the duchy's populace acknowledge only one remedy - wine.
   1172817|00000000||Calm yourself!
   1172819|00000000||Witcher!
   1126659|00000000||Ladies and gentlemen! The witcher defeats the previously invincible Still Waters! And what a bout it was!
   1191681|00000000||Freed of his vow, the knight can now show his face!
   1126661|00000000||Your blows are strong and true. My congratulations.
   1126663|00000000||Thanks.
   1170432|00000000||Have you naught to add? I'm a woman - no wry remarks?
   1170466|00000000||What for? It's the thirteenth century. Nothing peculiar about it. Women own taverns, run farms and… fight.
   1191683|00000000||Will you not claim there was no honor in fighting a wench?
   1191685|00000000||No. I'd expect to hear that from someone who was afraid to lose to a woman.
   1126677|00000000||Now only Colossus stands between you and a chance at the Maestro. Saint Sebastian - that's where you should go. Look for the largest courtyard.
   1126673|00000000||You've Colossus and Mancomb left to face. With that duo defeated, you can seek out the Maestro.
   1192170|00000000||Look for Colossus in the largest courtyard you can find in San Sebastian. While Mancomb you will find wandering about the docks south of Hauteville.
   1126675|00000000||Only Mancomb remains. You should look for him by the docks south of Hauteville. Once you've bested him, you can try your strength against the Maestro.
   1126679|00000000||A good fight, a sound fight. One that's earned you the right to challenge the Maestro. You've only dishonor to gain should you back out now.
   1191687|00000000||You'll find the Maestro by the docks.
   1126681|00000000||Still Waters handily defeats the witcher! The titan remains undefeated, his vow of silence still very much in force!
   1177512|00000000||You fight with honor. I must give you that.
   1177514|00000000||A robust fight with a most surprising finish…! A lady-knight! Who's ever heard of such a thing?
   1194418|00000000||Oi-oi-oi.
   1194420|00000000||A day like all others…
   1194422|00000000||Me bones're achin' again.
   1159482|00000000||Tracks…?
   1159478|00000000||Smashed padlock. Someone broke in.
   1200331|00000000||Noises could be coming from grave robbers. Can't know for sure, though. Need to wait till after dusk, to confirm.
   1208642|00000000||Grave robbers usually try to keep quiet, but who knows. Need to look around.
   1197586|00000000||Hm. Might be noisy, but doubt they're the source of the sounds in question.
   1159529|00000000||Strange. Can't hear anything now…
   1178568|00000000||Can't hear anything, but might want to look around anyway.
   1159486|00000000||Lots of tracks. Not much I can glean from them, though.
   1160686|00000000||Empty wine bottles, leftovers… Big to-do? Not likely…
   1197655|00000000||Bloomers? Yeah, romantic as all hell here.
   1159484|00000000||Trampled grass and… hm, bloomers? Not the kind of moaning he meant, though.
   1176594|00000000||Gotta come back after dark.
   1159480|00000000||Grave's dug up… Thing is, grave robbers don't usually wail and moan that much.
   1144917|00000000||Step away.
   1144915|00000000||Will you stop bothering me?
   1144919|00000000||Hide that bleeding blade.
   1144923|00000000||You just signed your death warrant…
   1144925|00000000||I want to kill him! Me!
   1144921|00000000||He's mine!
   1144929|00000000||I'm watching your flinty hide.
   1144927|00000000||Don't dare to think you've got carte blanche here!
   1144931|00000000||For bloody tripe's sake!
   1191092|00000000||How are you faring?
   1191094|00000000||Fortune favor you.
   1191096|00000000||Yes, master?
   1191098|00000000||La la la liii, ha ha ha haaa!
   1191100|00000000||What was that?
   1191106|00000000||Eyes see, ears hear, but lips are shut.
   1191108|00000000||Unbelievable.
   1191102|00000000||Mummy!
   1175222|00000000||Greetings… Akh akh.
   1175220|00000000||Yes…?
   1175224|00000000||Akh akh… Criminey, a worrying cough…
   1175226|00000000||Akh akh…. The Prophet Lebioda's lungs! I must see a medic.

   1180922|00000000||{Que?} [Yes?]
   1180920|00000000||{Ceádmil!} [Greetings!]
   1188998|00000000||Why men throw their lives away attacking an armed witcher… I'll never know. Something wrong with my face?
   1189293|00000000||Lake Merten wrote about, gotta be. Nice place. Pretty as hell.
   1200791|00000000||Merten's last stop…
   1213352|00000000||Leave me alone.
   1189931|00000000||It was painfully clear the audience with the duchess would not be a pleasant one. For Geralt and Regis had failed to establish Dettlaff's whereabouts, though not for lack of trying. Matters, alas, quickly took an even more tragic turn. When Geralt failed to deliver Syanna to the lover betrayed, he fulfilled his threat and sent down upon Beauclair and its environs a plague of horrid beasts. The witcher immediately resumed his efforts to find and confront Dettlaff.<br>
   1189932|00000000||Geralt had decided - Dettlaff could not be considered harmless. True, he was doubtless a sentient creature as well as Regis' close friend - but no. The witcher would resolve matters with his blade. To do this, Geralt would need to force Dettlaff to reveal himself, then to fight. And this in turn required him to find one of only a handful of ancient vampires remaining in the world. And the only one who could help him with the latter was that legend of the Beauclairois boheme, Orianna.<br>
   1189933|00000000||Geralt heeded Regis' advice and would seek to resolve the crisis through peaceful means. To do so, he would need to fulfill the vampire blackmailer's demand and free Syanna. He now needed to establish where this troublemaker was being held. The witcher suspected he could extract this information from Captain Damien de la Tour, the duchess' confidant in such matters.<br>
   1155906|00000000||Kill the vampire.
   1156371|00000000||Ask Orianna where to find the Unseen Elder.
   1173906|00000000||Kill the vampire.
   1172918|00000000||Kill the vampire.
   1153285|00000000||Follow Regis.
   1172820|00000000||Use your Witcher Senses to track down Damien.
   1173747|00000000||Kill the vampire attacking Damien's unit.
   1180368|00000000||Find Damien and ask him where Syanna is being kept.
   1173746|00000000||Follow Damien's unit using your Witcher Senses.
   1180794|00000000||Talk to the birds to inform Regis where he should meet you.
   1208532|00000000||Get inside the playroom.
   1180369|00000000||The Night of Long Fangs
   1182450|00000000||Whuh? What's this about?
   1182801|00000000||Jack be nimble! Vampires attacked the city?! Once again, I've slept through all the fun!
   1182457|00000000||Was that just a dream, or did you really slaughter the Beast?!
   1182452|00000000||In the forest, the mighty forest, the brown bear sleeps tonight…
   1182454|00000000||Blaspheming bunnies… could I ever use a nap!
   1182459|00000000||Huh? I'm sorry!
   1182463|00000000||Yaaawn… Witcher?
   1182461|00000000||Hullo, hullo.
   1191741|00000000||If not for you, witcher… Crikey! A thousand thanks!
   1188390|00000000||Let the tourney begin!
   1188392|00000000||In round one, Agnetha Skold faces Eric von Vrog!
   1200031|00000000||And Geralt of Rivia plays Hamal ogn Dangbahli!
   1166802|00000000||Let's grab a table.
   1166804|00000000||A wager would you wish to make?
   1166806|00000000||What'd you have in mind?
   1166808|00000000||Weapons do I collect, and your sword of silver my eye has caught. Should I win, I should take it. Should I lose, to you another, equally precious shall I give.
   1166814|00000000||Sword's how I earn my keep. Can't risk it, won't. I say we play for the normal stakes.
   1166810|00000000||No, let's play for the normal stakes.
   1166809|00000000||Agreed.
   1166812|00000000||All right. So it be.
   1209963|00000000||That is… no sword at your side have you, but a witcher you are, thus concealed them you must have…
   1209368|00000000||My swords, my concern. Don't need 'em to play gwent. Cards is all that takes.
   1209370|00000000||If you so say…

   1186507|00000000||Dyeing clothes a popular service around here? Never come across something like this before…
   1186509|00000000||For in the North all is gray, drab and muted… quite the opposite to Toussaint! Here, look around and you will see the green of verdant hills, the deep blue of the lake, and the blood red of wine! It's no wonder we love our dyes.
   1197524|00000000||A lady will change the color of her dress to match her mood. To green when she is jealous, to yellow when she wishes to radiate joy. A knight, in turn, might with color signal the nature of his vow - white to show he's made a vow of chastity, for instance.
   1197526|00000000||Hmm… need to stop introducing myself as the "White Wolf," then.
   1186502|00000000||Dyeing clothes - that a popular service around here?
   1186511|00000000||Gotta go. So long.
   1186503|00000000||Farewell.
   1186501|00000000||Show me your wares.
   1186505|00000000||Fine, show me what you got.
   1186500|00000000||Hm… What're you selling, exactly?
   1197514|00000000||Top quality dyes. Guaranteed to produce intense colors that never bleed!
   1197516|00000000||Ah. None for me, thanks.
   1197518|00000000||What do you mean?! Even the best warrior must look kempt, care for his appearance! For example, he might favor bright colors, to stand out from the crowd, or dark, to slip unseen through his lover's window by night.
   1197520|00000000||Hm… Usually focus on armor's other attributes, color's not so important… But I guess there's some sense to what you say.
   1197522|00000000||There certainly is! Please, peruse and purchase! You shall not be disappointed!
   1197528|00000000||What dye shall it be, sir? Aquamarine? Ashen white?
   1209925|416c104c||Hornitz
   1106145|00000000||Pure poppycock, you beard mangler! The latest rage! In some bumbotched Kovir?! We're in Nilfgaard, you bungmunch!
   1106147|00000000||What'd he do to you?
   1106149|00000000||What did he do? He coiffed me. Gave me a duck's arse, an ape drape, a beaver paddle! I don't even know! So ashamed I couldn't attend the tourney!
   1106151|00000000||I'd have proved my valor! Mademoiselle Vivienne de Tabris my prize! Then this scalawag with his talk of the rage! Missed my chance by the hair on my head!
   1163433|00000000||Got him back good, from what I can see.
   1163435|00000000||That is but the start. I've not yet decided if I shouldn't snip off something more.
   1093361|00000000||Listen, children, a story you shall hear, of a witcher who walloped a rogue knight's derriere!
   1093357|00000000||It's hair. It'll grow back. Really wanna kill a man because he gave you a bad cut?
   1106316|00000000||And who are you, gadabout, to lecture me, a heraldic lord?! We've a bleeding champion of the oppressed, men.
   1106318|00000000||At him!
   1093349|00000000||Hair grows back.
   1093348|00000000||Doesn't seem chivalrous…
   1093351|00000000||Doesn't seem terribly chivalrous. What about honor, your oath on the peacock, all that?
   1163451|00000000||I do vow on the noble bird I shall gut you if you do not skedaddle!
   1093353|00000000||En garde! Stand and fight! I challenge thee! And you boys dare not intervene! By golly, by gum, this will be chivalrous!
   1106250|00000000||Hands down I would have won that tourney. And had Mademoiselle Vivienne already warming my bed!
   1106271|00000000||"Trust me, sir knight, this coif is the latest rage. At the Koviri court they'll have nothing else. No damsel will manage to resist." Bollobobs!
   1107830|00000000||Not so close! I require a broad view of the action!
   1193410|00000000||Good morning!
   1193412|00000000||Ahahahaha! Heeheeheehee!
   1193414|00000000||Darnit!
   1193416|00000000||Noooooooooo!
   1201605|00000000||Don't mean to pry, Your Grace, but… curious how you met Dandelion. Mind telling me about it?
   1201607|00000000||So long as it's not a sensitive subject, that is.
   1201609|00000000||Oh, ancient history… My father announced a grand tourney. Julian was invited. He was to compose a song about a valorous struggle in the arena.
   1201623|00000000||What he wrote was the most beautiful love ballad I had ever heard. Haha. Papa was furious, refused to pay him.
   1201625|00000000||Ballad - about you?
   1201627|00000000||Not overtly. I was married to Raymund at the time, after all.
   1201647|00000000||Hmm. I get it.
   1132114|00000000||You meet Dandelion - how'd you meet?
   1201655|00000000||This tourney - quite a dose of pomp and circumstance.
   1201657|00000000||We cherish this tradition. My great-grandmama, Adela Marta, elevated it to its current status… For the longest time, she could not decide whom to wed. Meanwhile, her suitors, and there were swarms, often dueled one another.
   1201659|00000000||In their contests Ademarta saw an altogether comfortable way of picking the prime apple from the bushel of potential husbands, determining who had what she valued most in men - strength, valor and cunning.
   1201661|00000000||Thus she commanded them to take part in tourneys. Though in the end she chose none of them and wed instead the youngest son of Nilfgaard's reigning emperor, whom she met on a journey south.
   1201663|00000000||But Beauclair's inhabitants had begun to enjoy the knights' sparring?
   1201665|00000000||Very much so! And not only they. The year after, knights from far and wide gathered to face one another for sport and glory. And so it has remained. Though the prize has changed - the duchess' hand and half the duchy are no longer in the offing…
   1201805|00000000||Still, Beauclair's tourneys are famed the world over. Of that we are rather proud.
   1201621|00000000||Knightly tournament - seems like a big deal.
   1201597|00000000||Thanks for sparing the time, Your Grace.
   1201599|00000000||Duty calls?
   1201601|00000000||You got it.
   1201603|00000000||I understand. Understand and approve.
   1132115|00000000||See you later.
   1142556|00000000||Has Toussaint always been neutral?
   1132106|00000000||Can't help but wonder how Toussaint manages to stay out of every war. Nilfgaard's next door, yet it never comes to so much as a minor border skirmish. Not to mention a full-fledged invasion.
   1132108|00000000||Our knights guard our borders. And my cousin, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, assured me Toussaint would remain neutral and has kept his promise.
   1201643|00000000||I have oft tried to prevail upon him, in no uncertain terms, to tame his belligerence once and for all. Sadly, he has not heeded my pleas. To the world's great sorrow, I fear.
   1201645|00000000||Sorrow indeed, Your Grace.
   1132102|00000000||Yes, Geralt?
   1201593|00000000||Wanted to talk. That is, if it's no bother, Your Grace.
   1201595|00000000||Why ever would it be? I'm listening, what is it?
   1201567|00000000||What is it?
   1154660|00000000||Sausages, hams, pâtés!
   1201881|00000000||So long.
   1201883|00000000||To be frank, I think you're a wiener! Ha ha!
   1201885|00000000||See you later.
   1201887|00000000||Oh yes, you surely will! I can tell an obsessed sausage snarfer when I see one!
   1154663|00000000||Farewell.
   1154661|00000000||Like to buy something…
   1154665|00000000||Fine, show me what you got.
   1154658|00000000||Meat of the freshest sort! Hot sausage links! Ripe blood pudding!
   1192288|00000000||Makes you look dignified… and manlier than in real life.
   1192290|00000000||Does it? The painter's a friend of mine. Could be she gave me slightly broader shoulders… Meant well, I'm sure.
   1192292|00000000||Don't doubt it. But didn't I see this painting at your place?
   1192294|00000000||This is its perfect replica. And it's yours… to remember me by.
   1192260|00000000||Geralt! Here at last!
   1192280|00000000||A lot.
   1193976|00000000||You shouldn't have. Really. Not everyone likes seeing you first thing every morning.
   1193980|00000000||Come on, don't be dramatic - this is the guest room. If you ask me, it belongs here, fits this space like a warm glove.
   1192285|00000000||Not at all.
   1192304|00000000||Good. So Geralt, important to remember - if anyone asks, I'm not here.
   1208450|00000000||Last time I was in Toussaint, enjoying myself, true, Anarietta, that is, the duchess, got a little carried away. Banished me from the duchy on pain of death. Wouldn't want to ruffle her feathers without cause.
   1192314|00000000||Well? Going to show me around, tell me the story?
   1192316|00000000||Course. Let's go.
   1194020|00000000||Good. Well, now we've dispensed with all the formalities, I want you tell me all about what happened here.
   1194034|00000000||Right, now we've dispensed with the formalities, why don't you fill me in. What's been going on here?
   1194022|00000000||You oughta know. Got me out of prison, didn't you?
   1194024|00000000||But I want to hear your side, first-hand. And I'll be honest - intend to use every last bit in a new ballad.
   1194133|00000000||… Sadly, I wasn't able to save Syanna. Dettlaff showed her no mercy, no understanding… and you know the rest.
   1194137|00000000||What a tale…! Feel sorriest for Anarietta, poor thing. Oo… I should've come here with you. Might've pulled off some miracle together. Though, truth be told, I had my hands full back home.
   1192320|00000000||… Luckily, Syanna made up with Anarietta, seems to have abandoned her plans. She's locked up now, awaiting sentencing, really. Most think the duchess'll forgive her. Might take some time, but…
   1193943|00000000||What a story! Seems I missed quite a lot! Huh, shame I didn't ride here with you. Though truth be told, had my hands full back home as well.
   1192306|00000000||Wise. Especially since she's been through quite a bit recently.
   1192312|00000000||I've heard some rumors, but I'd love a first-hand account. Does it have the makings of a ballad?
   1194008|00000000||Now for some serious business. If anyone asks, I'm not here.
   1208452|00000000||Last time I was in Beauclair, admittedly enjoying myself, my Anarietta, that is, the duchess, got a bit carried away and banished me on pain of death. Wouldn't want to ruffle her feathers again.
   1194004|00000000||Now for some serious business. If anyone asks, I'm not here. Last time I was in Beauclair, admittedly enjoying myself, Anarietta…
   1192281|00000000||Not at all.
   1187615|00000000||Dandelion? What the hell're you doing here?
   1192266|00000000||I'm not here. I'm a figment of your imagination, 'cause you really want me to be here.
   1192269|00000000||Brought you a housewarming gift. It's also an illusion. How do you like it?
   1192277|00000000||Moving in…?
   1192279|00000000||Me? Hah, hardly! Brought you a little something. A housewarming gift. How do you like it?
   1192284|00000000||A lot.
   1193949|00000000||Good. So, some important business. If anyone asks, I'm not here. Last time I was in Toussaint, enjoying myself, admittedly, Anarietta…
   1193951|00000000||Dandelion…
   1193959|00000000||That is, the duchess…
   1193961|00000000||Dandelion.
   1193963|00000000||Got a bit carried away and banished me on pain of death. I wouldn't want…
   1193965|00000000||Dandelion. Anna Henrietta… she's dead.
   1193967|00000000||What…? But… how?
   1193969|00000000||Mhhh, c'mon. Got a story to tell you for a change…
   1193971|00000000||Sadly, I couldn't stop Syanna. She killed her own sister. Just one small consolation - Syanna's dead, too.
   1193973|00000000||Is that so…? Gods… what a terrible, terrible loss. She was the morning sun striking dew, a vibrant butterfly among dun moths…
   1208448|00000000||Should've ridden down here with you. Might've done something together to avert this. But I had my hands full back home.
   1196054|00000000||How's business? You and Zoltan still have your tavern? Or has he embarked on some new venture?
   1196056|00000000||You know him. We'll share a jug of mead and he'll go on about some new plan he's got. Nothing ever comes of it. So, we're still there.
   1208456|00000000||Recently, we discovered Novigrad's largest wine importer was a lying cheat.
   1196060|00000000||Watering down his wines. But so clever you'd never taste the difference.
   1196062|00000000||So how'd you figure out he was up to something?
   1196064|00000000||This one day I was feeling down in the muck. Decided to lift my spirits by… well, getting a little drunk. Actually, replace "a little" with "really."
   1208462|00000000||So I knocked back a bottle - nothing. Then another - maybe a slight buzz.
   1196066|00000000||Might not be a lightweight anymore. Could be those years of training have finally paid off.
   1196068|00000000||Come on! It took me five bottles to start seeing double.
   1208458|00000000||I thought, huh, might just be a weird day. So I tried the same thing the next morning. Exact same result.
   1196070|00000000||I told Zoltan. He tried it, and confirmed my findings. So we decided to ask the importer some tough questions. The man cracked.
   1208460|00000000||I threatened to tell everyone about his trickery unless he gave me a discount.
   1196052|00000000||You and Zoltan still in business?
   1194913|00000000||Plan to stay long?
   1194915|00000000||Don't know yet, but… might stay a little while. I've always loved Beauclair. The place is made for poets.
   1194925|00000000||What'll you do here?
   1194927|00000000||City's full of knights-errant, and they all want ballads immortalizing their deeds.
   1208454|00000000||Get this - I've already been approached by a knight who's spent years battling the weather. Says he's got a real bone to pick with gusty storms.
   1194931|00000000||Battles the weather? How's that work?
   1194933|00000000||Don't know. Promised to show me when the time was right. There's another who's vowed to move a mountain that's blocking his ailing mother's view of the sunset.
   1194935|00000000||So he's moving it. One stone at a time. Sole worry is that his mama won't live to see him finish.
   1194937|00000000||Hmm… You're right, prime ballad material there… Glad you came. We'll have some good talks.
   1194943|00000000||Plan to kick around Beauclair long?
   1194945|00000000||I rode here with the specific intention of staying a while. Priscilla voiced no objections. But since my Anarietta, that is, the duchess, is gone, there's no point.
   1194947|00000000||She meant too much to me. Can't possibly walk these streets now, knowing I'll never see her again…
   1194756|00000000||What'll you do now?
   1194939|00000000||See you later, Dandelion.
   1194941|00000000||See you, witcher.
   1194757|00000000||See you later.
   1194754|00000000||What've you been up to?
   1194759|00000000||What's new, old friend?
   1194761|00000000||Everything's fine, great. Thanks to you, I'm with a woman I'm entirely devoted to, surrendered my heart to.
   1194763|00000000||Didn't have all that much to do with that.
   1194765|00000000||If you hadn't been there, Priscilla would've died a cruel death. And right about now I'd be drowning my sorrows in some dive with piss-stained walls.
   1194767|00000000||Hope she's better.
   1194769|00000000||She had the best medics around. Wounds've all healed. She's confident, outgoing, she's got places to go and folk to see. And in the alcove…? I mean, can you imagine she--
   1194771|00000000||Dandelion, I can't imagine, and I won't…
   1194773|00000000||All right, but… your loss.
   1211082|00000000||How are you, old friend?
   1211084|00000000||Not well, unfortunately. After you left Novigrad, this one day, Priscilla was attacked. In the street.
   1211086|00000000||She was wounded badly, took a long time to recover. Luckily, she's better now.
   1211088|00000000||What are you talking about? Who the hell attacked her?
   1211090|00000000||Still looking for the bastard who hurt her. Once I find him, he'll regret what he did, regret the day he was born.
   1211092|00000000||Sorry, Dandelion. Sorry I wasn't around.
   1211094|00000000||Got your own problems, your own priorities. Can't expect you to be at my side whenever anything goes wrong. Besides, it's Priscilla, so I need to handle this.
   1194812|00000000||What's new, old friend?
   1194814|00000000||Everything's coming up Dandelion. Priscilla's much better and our relationship's a budding flower blossoming in the spring sun.
   1194816|00000000||You two still together?
   1194818|00000000||Don't act so surprised! The woman was made for me. As I was for her. She told me so.
   1194820|00000000||Know how many times I've heard that some woman was made for you?
   1194822|00000000||Ehh, love's blunders… Who's never made one? I hadn't met Priscilla yet. Now I know she's my heart's captor. You know, think we might get married.
   1194824|00000000||Congratulations.
   1194147|00000000||Dandelion, got a minute?
   1194149|00000000||For you, my friend, always.

   1191775|00000000||Pff. You cannot truly expect recompense, witcher. You merely did your job, your duty.
   1178528|00000000||Geralt and Regis then searched Dettlaff's hideout. Ironically, the "Beast" had made his lair in a storeroom above an abandoned toy shop. After thoroughly searching the site, the witcher and the vampire deduced that Dettlaff was being black-mailed. He had committed the murders in Toussaint at the behest of mysterious individuals who were holding his beloved hostage. Our intrepid duo resolved to split up. Regis would remain at the toy shop and hope Dettlaff would return. He preferred to speak with Dettlaff alone, without the witcher there to disrupt their tête-à-tête…<br>
   1189589|00000000||It proved quite the ordeal for Regis, a sacrifice one might say. But they obtained the last ingredient required for Resonance, and the vampire could prepare the concoction. Geralt drank a dose, and visions ensued. He saw Dettlaff meet and speak to a young bootblack. Then the witcher and the vampire set off in search of the boy.<br>
   1178525|00000000||The bootblack proved both pugnacious and resolute. Geralt and Regis were desperate to learn anything they could about Dettlaff. The boy sensed this and decided to take advantage. It was clear he would one day go far, such was the knack he demonstrated for business. As regarded the search for Dettlaff, Geralt and Regis learned he had brought his boots to be cleaned on a number of occasions. Each time, he had asked the boy to return them to an old, abandoned shop, where he was to leave them at the door. The witcher and the vampire set off to explore the site.<br>
   1188322|00000000||Use your Witcher Senses to look for clues in the toy shop.
   1161039|00000000||Find the bootblack who appeared in the vision.
   1161057|00000000||Visit the bootblack during his working hours.
   1178549|00000000||Pay the bootblack for information.
   1161058|00000000||Defend the bootblack from his attackers.
   1161071|00000000||Follow Regis through the city.
   1175132|00000000||Enter the toy shop.
   1161074|00000000||Search the toy shop using your Witcher Senses.

   1184875|00000000||Want to play tag? You'd never catch me!

   1208951|00000000||<i>You want a fine pair of boots, you say? Bring me the hide of a silver basilisk, and I’ll make you boots the whole world will envy.</i><br> – Anatole Vizholy, shoemaker from Beauclair<br>
   1208952|00000000||Geralt always liked looking at things that don’t exist. Be it a vampire with a human heart or the last basilisk of a species that no scholar has classified, discovering something thought not to be there to be discovered caused him great pleasure. That is why he took an interest in a contract which, at first glance, seemed banal, but proved to be very intriguing. It concerned the last basilisk of the nearly-extinct species Regulus Platinum.<br>
   1208959|00000000||The thin scales covering silver basilisks are thinner than those of their more common brethren, making them thereby easier to burn. The Igni Sign will thus prove very useful in a fight against one of their number.<br><br>Yet one must be especially wary of the monsters’ venom, which is much stronger than that found in their widespread kin.<br>
   1210296|00000000||In the end, Geralt decided not to kill the basilisk, for who in his right mind would raise his sword against a living legend?
   1212146|00000000||Geralt decided to kill the basilisk, the witcher trade not being one that makes room for sentiment.<br><br>He thus eliminated the last member of a species which now could definitively be classified as extinct.

   1189402|00000000||So young… so beautiful…
   1205120|00000000||It seemed as if matters had come to a head and the witcher would finally face he who had for some time succeeded in slinking from Geralt's grip like a snake. The Cintrian was to appear at a soirée hosted by "Mandragora" - an exclusive club that brought together all manner of artists who thought very highly of themselves. As I see it, they were a host of individuals whom nature had denied any significant talent. Thus, they opted not to produce more and better work, but instead to whimper into the ears of wealthy patrons - a practice for which I have always had the utmost contempt. But back to the Cintrian - Geralt and Anna Henrietta decided they would attend the soirée and nab this scoundrel dog.<br>
   1205130|00000000||The witcher was largely unaccustomed to battles in which lies, flattery and the occasional petty insult served as the combatants' chief arms. Yet with the aid of Anarietta (much better acquainted with this type of combat - mean retorts being her weapon of choice), he managed to blend into the members of Beauclair's boheme who had assembled and mingle largely unnoticed. Together, the duchess and the witcher searched for the Cintrian. He had reportedly arrived for the evening with the famed singer Cecilia Bellante on his arm. Alas, poor Cecilia had not known the evening would end in tragedy for her. Geralt found her, her throat cut just moments before, and set off in pursuit of her murderer.<br>
   1205135|00000000||The Cintrian had appeared that evening to steal the Heart of Toussaint, a ducal jewel in the possession of Orianna, the soirée's host. The witcher could not interrogate the thief, as he had died tragically while attempting to make off with his loot. Yet he had left behind a clue leading to Dun Tynne Castle, which the witcher made his next destination. Yet the assault on this fort manned by many knights would not prove easy. Ironically, Anna Henrietta made this so by giving Geralt an additional objective. You see, the thief had first obtained a barrel of ducal wine and then attempted to pinch a jewel that had in the past belonged to Syanna, Anarietta's sister. The fact of said sister's existence surprised me as much as it must surprise you, my readers. Who knew Anarietta had a sister, and what's more, one even more fiery than the duchess herself? These facts caused the duchess to suspect Syanna could herself be at Dun Tynne. So she ordered the witcher to go there and find her. As if these revelations were not enough, the evening ended in a philosophically complex scene featuring the duchess of Toussaint, several ancient higher vampires and a grumpy witcher sharing a table. The conversation proved both lively and varied, spanning matters ranging from the intricacies of combating monsters to the propriety of wearing deep-cut formal dresses.<br>

   1205746|00000000||Do not avert your eyes, help…
   1198457|00000000||My regards to the tourney's victor.
   1198455|00000000||Now that you've killed the Beast, will you not be bored here, witcher?
   1190435|00000000||A third cries out for a mercy blow, wanting death's peace to know… And those who were in fresh graves thrown, slowly march to lands unknown…
   1190433|00000000||At thunderous speed with lances they strike, many a knight will not leave with his life. A wild flash fills one man's eyes, through another's veins hot blood flies…
   1190441|00000000||Death!
   1190439|00000000||Come here! I'll cleave your pate!
   1190437|00000000||Control yourself, hound, or I shall tighten your lead!
   1190443|00000000||Whoa-ho, it seems we're in for trouble!
   1190445|00000000||Sir witcher!
   1190447|00000000||Hey! I spoke to you, sir!
   1162763|00000000||Oooooh, I'm fee fi fo famished.
   1162761|00000000||I'm - akh, akh - starving!
   1192850|00000000||If only those vampires had gobbled me down.
   1162765|00000000||My belly roars and growls….
   1162767|00000000||I would kill for a bite!
   1185285|00000000||Turtley dumpings!
   1185287|00000000||Beh, nonsense!
   1185291|00000000||Scrawny, gray haired, ill-favored…
   1185289|00000000||Tsk tsk. And he's to save us from the Beast? Why, he's just a… a molly-coddle.
   1187542|00000000||Look - I got a gift from a druidess.
   1196428|00000000||What is it?
   1196430|00000000||Powdered mushrooms.
   1196432|00000000||Oh, I don't care for mushrooms.
   1196434|00000000||They're not to be eaten, silly. Drink a brew made of this powder and you'll see things you'd never see otherwise.
   1196436|00000000||Like what?
   1196438|00000000||The other night, I saw the Prophet Lebioda himself. He came to my hut, his willy wagging free as the day he was born.

   1207228|00000000||Defend yourself, rogue!
   1207230|00000000||We shall teach you manners!
   1207224|00000000||The man needs to be taught a lesson!
   1207226|00000000||You shall regret your dishonesty, lout!
   1207232|00000000||He's a cheat! A cad!
   1207234|00000000||The impertinence!
   1179140|00000000||Left! Go left!
   1179142|00000000||The hanse never forgives, gray tufts.

   1179146|00000000||Shall we dance?
   1179148|00000000||Your stones are sweating, gray crotch!
   1179150|00000000||What?! Will you turn pansy and run?!
   1179144|00000000||Too too too too too…
   1179152|00000000||Onward, hanse! Together!
   1179154|00000000||Bumbotch me backwards!
   1208540|00000000||Hmm… Hey! Anyone here?!
   1208542|00000000||Dammit. Looks like I'm too late for the "test."
   1147830|00000000||You have proven worthy of wielding the blade. Beyond all doubt.
   1154568|00000000||Behold, your Aerondight…
   1160117|00000000||We've met before…
   1160119|00000000||Certainly. The hermit admitted he knew you, remember?
   1160121|00000000||The Lady of the Lake…
   1154571|00000000||It is I. Forget not that you are a man right and honorable, devoted to doing good. And for these reasons you received the blade. Now bear it.
   1160087|00000000||And I trust this time you shall not lose it…
   1199531|00000000||It seems failure is your lot in this quest, witcher!
   1199951|00000000||To lay claim to virtue is easy, to prove it, much harder! But perhaps one day… who knows.
   1213069|2b28ae42||Teacher
    591992|00000000||Ehhh!
    591980|00000000||Your arse is mine.

   1209216|00000000||Long years of solitary study tend to make mages somewhat eccentric. As the years pass, laypeople begin to irritate them more and more:  they are dense, unreliable, disobedient and determined not to understand the gravity of mages’ work. They display emotion when they should show discipline and self-mastery. No wonder mages have long considered the best companions to be artificial constructs they themselves bring to life and design to follow their rules and meet their needs. Professor Moreau was no exception in this regard. His golem was his dutiful servant and companion, in good times and bad. Moreau’s golem was also an excellent guardian: massive, unyielding and devilishly strong. All in all, he was a tough nut for a witcher to crack!
   1207981|00000000||Moreau’s Golem
   1191937|00000000||Hic-cup! Ehhe! Buurrp.
   1191933|00000000||What the hell?
   1191935|00000000||Uuuuuuh?
   1195421|00000000||Not jarred-off easily, eh?
   1195423|00000000||What? Smartass, eh?
   1195426|00000000||Not bad.
   1195428|00000000||{Hrr..pfu!}
   1195431|00000000||Kill!
   1195433|00000000||I'll kill you!
   1162201|00000000||Hmm, cave paintings… This here looks a bit like a nekker. Big blob's what… a troll?
   1163233|00000000||Nekkers depicting their victory over some trolls? That even possible - nekker propaganda?
   1171721|00000000||What? Wha?
   1171719|00000000||I believe I might… vomit.
   1193344|00000000||My little dumpling, my girl… the vampires ate her…
   1171725|00000000||Poopy bums and drooping danglies!
   1171723|00000000||Give your paunch a little squeeze, watch the water flee your wee! Heheh.
   1055186|3a515643||Nilfgaardian Noblewoman
   1150333|00000000||You're supposed to follow me.
   1178066|00000000||Why'd you make me watch that execution?
   1178068|00000000||So you'd know this is no almshouse for lost orphan boys.
   1178070|00000000||Wanted me to think I was next. Enjoy that? Getting a rise out of folk?
   1179747|00000000||You guessed it. The harlotshounds that land here, I detest them. So I do everything in my power so they'll know they're in the clink, not on holiday.
   1186003|00000000||Welcome! Welcome!
   1186005|00000000||Ehh, the world these days…
   1186007|00000000||Guard! Help!
   1192914|00000000||They say the Beast devoured Sir Milton, armor and all. Now the medics all fear it'll come to them, begging them to soothe its heartburn!
   1192908|00000000||Our barber got so sick, his medic told him he could drink no more alcohol. Not even a glass of wine with dinner. Just water! Like an animal!
   1192916|00000000||Can you believe the tidings from the quarry? A cow dropped from the sky in broad daylight? It's a miracle there weren't more dead!
   1192910|00000000||It cannot be!
   1192912|00000000||Inconceivable…
   1186013|00000000||Without Duchess Anna Henrietta, our duchy's no duchy at all!
   1186015|00000000||Witcher! Our duchess! How could you fail so miserably? You were to protect her!
   1186009|00000000||Summoning a witcher, was that truly necessary? And our knights, what are they - chopped liver?
   1186011|00000000||Ahh, pecker it all.
   1186756|00000000||So, the morning after, is it?
   1186754|00000000||You look thirsty, oh, thirsty, indeed…
   1186758|00000000||Est Est? Erveluce? They all taste like the cheapest plonk when they come back up!
   1186760|00000000||What's new, Silverlocks? Looking for diversion?
   1201460|00000000||Whenever troubles get me down, there's nothing like a quart of White Wolf to lift me right back up!
   1177674|00000000||Top of the tops to you!
   1177676|00000000||Can I do something for you?
   1177678|00000000||Smell that? Welcome to Toussaint!
   1177680|00000000||From buds to bottles - a marvelous process!
   1198837|00000000||Master, help! Monsters! There!
   1198835|00000000||Good sir! Help! Vileness in the fields! They're infested!
   1177682|00000000||Whoaaaa…
   1177684|00000000||Witcher… Calmer.
   1198839|00000000||Beware of the Vermentino folk. They're a vicious lot!
   1198841|00000000||Witcher, you must give the Coronata crew a wide berth! Vipers, to a man!
   1198843|00000000||None expected that finale! To reconcile Vermentino and Coronata…? Thank you, witcher!
   1198855|00000000||I thank you for the rescue! You're one fine fellow, witcher!
   1166071|00000000||This is no time to chat. We must find Joss.
   1166073|00000000||That's one bean down! Good work!
   1166075|00000000||Only one bean to go. Concentrate, Geralt!
   1166077|00000000||Just a bit more and I'll be free! At last!
   1166079|00000000||Go on. Jump in the well.
   1166081|00000000||Stop prodding me and find the beans!
   1195153|00000000||Down below lies your vineyard.
   1192869|00000000||Where we grow a strain of Carvanere, one of the world's oldest. Aged in oak barrels, it provides for an exquisite wine with distinct blackberry, wild cherry, plum and cinnamon notes. Marvelous!
   1193463|00000000||Have to try it one of these days…
   1192854|00000000||Baron Rossell ordered the vines in this part of the estate uprooted and olive groves planted in their place. They look beautiful, especially come spring.
   1193461|00000000||Don't look at all bad now, either.
   1192906|00000000||Madame Nina planted diminutive, delicate flowers and herbs here. One might say their aroma still hangs in the air…
   1193469|00000000||You're quite the romantic, Barnabas-Basil…
   1192893|00000000||Drank himself to death?
   1192895|00000000||Not at all. When found the next day, he had concluded he'd witnessed twin miracles - the water had been changed into wine, and he had survived. He retired to a monastery in the Dragon Mountains and began preaching the wisdoms of Lebioda.
   1189153|00000000||And welcome inside…
   1191614|00000000||Ah, how unfortunate, it seems I wearied you, sir.
   1199002|00000000||Time has not been kind to Corvo Bianco, but a bit of remodeling should do wonders. If you wish to discuss this further, I shall be in the house.
   1189162|00000000||Nice well. Picturesque.
   1189538|00000000||Yes, though it ran dry long ago. During the raucous feasts Master Bolius held, he would order it filled with wine.
   1189540|00000000||There's a tale about a guest, attending a Bolius ball for the first time and thus unaware of the custom. He had suffered great heartbreak and had decided to end his life by jumping into the well.
   1189542|00000000||The festivities were coming to a close and the well was nearly empty when the suicidal guest finally jumped. Instead of killing himself, he merely broke his legs. To numb the pain, he drank the wine.
   1189164|00000000||The cellars, voila. During Monsieur Bolius' time, wine was kept here, but Baron Rossell used it to store olive oil as well.
   1193376|00000000||I took the liberty of cleaning up the, ahem, mess which…
   1193378|00000000||I made while fighting the bruxa? Thanks, Barnabas-Basil. Appreciate it.
   1189145|00000000||This served as an additional wine cellar in years of plentiful harvests.
   1193442|00000000||Hmm… a bit of work, and it'll make a fine stable for Roach…
   1189143|00000000||The servants' quarters. I occupy the green home. With the duchess' permission, I have hired a full staff, their salaries to be paid from the ducal treasury.
   1193438|00000000||Nice of her.
   1193348|00000000||Not the most sightly part of the estate, I admit, but I think it worthwhile for you, as master of the domain, to know where the help stays.
   1189147|00000000||Monsieur Bolius' wife, Nina, kept a garden here… Ahh, a supremely lovely place, it was…
   1193444|00000000||Bit neglected, now.
   1195151|00000000||I agree. Yet nothing stands in the way of restoring it to its former glory and once again planting it with herbs and other vegetation.
   1189149|00000000||As you can see, the facade is, how to put it, slightly stained… But one cannot deny it a certain subtle, southern charm…
   1193448|00000000||True. Though it could use a bit of subtle paint…
   1192922|00000000||Follow me, please.
   1196725|00000000||Been a majordomo all your life?
   1196727|00000000||Yes, I come from a long line of majordomos. My father was a majordomo, as was my grandfather before him. As was my great aunt. In fact, she was the one to start the tradition.
   1196729|00000000||Great aunt?
   1196731|00000000||A hard woman. It is said that already as a child, she knew where she was going. And went there.
   1196807|00000000||When she arrived in Beauclair, she signed on as a chambermaid at one of the vineyards, then slowly worked her way up to majordomo.
   1196809|00000000||She dragged the rest of the family up the same path.
   1202293|00000000||Greetings, witcher.
   1202295|00000000||Good to see you, Geralt.

   1178904|00000000||I'll miss you, witcher dear.

   1178908|00000000||Ooooh! Eensie weensie witcher wants to die!
   1178910|00000000||All together, frick it!
   1178912|00000000||He's nearly snapped! At him!
   1178914|00000000||Oh, now you're kerfluffed…

   1144419|00000000||You can't pull one over on me, witcher. I can see you're a killer.
   1192769|00000000||Geralt of Rivia, slayer of the Beast. I am in your debt. We all are.

   1144427|00000000||Mumsy!
   1144429|00000000||You're one fast son of your mum!
   1144431|00000000||Did that hurt? Dammit, did it?!

   1144433|00000000||No!

   1144445|00000000||That's more like it.

   1144447|00000000||At your service, witcher.

   1208546|00000000||Milton de Peyrac-Peyran was a baron from Toussaint and a member of Anna Henrietta’s inner circle of knights. This good-humored nobleman never met an overloaded banquet table he failed to unload of its burdens, yet nor did he ever shirk a fight against heavily-armed bandits or any other enemies of the duchy. Geralt had met Milton years ago, under very peculiar circumstances that deserve to be recounted properly and at length. Their roads crossed again when Milton came to the witcher as the duchess’ envoy, to ask our hero to journey with him to Toussaint.<br>
   1208545|00000000||Milton made for good company. Was he also a good man? That I do not know. Geralt told me later some incidents from his past gnawed on his conscience. We shall never know precisely what moral burdens he carried, for Milton de Peyrac-Peyran perished in the palace gardens, the Beast’s fourth victim. May he rest in peace.

   1173624|00000000||The bruxa Geralt encountered and killed in self-defense at Corvo Bianco differed from other creatures of this sort. Firstly, it was more intelligent, capable even of articulating words in human language without much difficulty. What’s more, this bruxa was tied to the Beast, the mysterious murderer prowling Beauclair at the time.<br><br>Fighting it presented Geralt with quite the challenge. Like other bruxae, this one possessed strength and speed far above that of any human, could turn invisible and could attack using a sonic wave.<br><br>As is typical for all vampires, it sought to suck its victim’s blood. This meant the usual defense against those creatures, the Black Blood potion, was an effective weapon against it, as were the Moon Dust bomb and, naturally, the witcher’s trusty silver blade.

   1171599|00000000||Huh? Where?
   1171603|00000000||A nap - now that sounds lovely…
   1171605|00000000||A dram of wine and forty winks - I could go for that….
   1214633|00000000||<i>The spider shall never lie down with the fly.</i><br>– Ofieri proverb<br><br>A similar saying could gain ground in our land concerning arachnomorphs and everything unable to flee them – meaning most every creature in the world. True, the tillers of the earth and fellers of trees need not fear them in their daily labors, for arachnomorphs, as distant, post-Conjunction cousins of common spiders, strongly prefer deep, dark caves and unfrequented sodden swamps.  Anyone who does come across them, however, had best hope his conscience is clear and his worldly affairs are in order, for his life shall soon end, as not even the fastest man in the world can outrun them and only a few witchers can hope to slay them. Even worse are the more aggressive and dangerous kind known as arachnomorph colossi, which are capable of devouring an entire ox in seconds.<br>
   1214634|00000000||Killing an arachnomorph is no easy task, but there are two approaches which stand a chance of succeeding. Due to the astonishing speed with which an arachnomorphs can move, there is no point in chasing it – better instead to choose an advantageous position and wait for it to strike. The beast will most often try a surprise attack, throwing at its prey a web which will leave the entangled victim barely able to counter blows, let alone strike ones of its own. One should thus strive to attack an arachnomorph when steps back to start weaving its web, seizing this moment of vulnerability before it is too late.<br><br>Arachnomorphs suffer the effects of most witcher Signs: they can be stunned with Aard or trapped with Yrden, and the Axii Sign can also be used to momentarily neutralize them.  A wise tactic is to attack them with a crossbow or bombs and coat one’s blade with insectoid oil.<br><br>One must be exceedingly careful when fighting an arachnomorph colossus – such a beast needs no time to weave a new web, having within its sacs a virtually limitless supply of silk. It can also jump great distances to pin its victim to the ground. Only the Yrden Sign can hope to slow it.

   1182431|00000000||Wait! Hold on! Why the ire?!
   1182437|00000000||Now why'd you have to go and get our duchess' goat?
   1182439|00000000||You! Witcher! Where were you when the vampires came to gut us?

   1193510|00000000||My oh my, it seems rather a fanciful bouillon spoon… or a key of some sort! There's a note here…
   1199611|00000000||Yeah. Note led me here. Any idea what the key might open?
   1199613|00000000||Never seen it before. But you might search the cellars. The previous owner left all sorts of knick knacks there.
   1188495|00000000||I know you're busy, but… round of gwent?
   1181905|00000000||A round of gwent?
   1156070|00000000||See you later.
   1156062|00000000||Thanks, that'll do.

   1156064|00000000||What're you serving up today?
   1189585|00000000||In the vision Geralt had experienced after imbibing Resonance, he had also seen a mill. He soon reached this site and explored it thoroughly. After all, Dettlaff had recently been there himself. The witcher hoped to find clues that would lead him to the murderer.<br>
   1189586|00000000||Using his Witcher Senses, Geralt thoroughly searched the mill. It had been the property of one Count de la Croix, who had put it up for sale. And it was here that the unfortunate count had met his end, murdered in cold blood.<br>
   1189587|00000000||The witcher had found some interesting clues, yet he decided to continue the investigation elsewhere. He thus abandoned the lead he had found, related to Dettlaff's visit to the mill.<br>

   1133354|00000000||Thanks, I'm fine.
   1178174|00000000||I wish both combatants good fortune and fame.
   1128272|00000000||Now entering the grounds, a titan of infamy! Gregoire de Gorgon, victor of last year's tourney!
   1128270|00000000||The witcher of Rivia! Geralt his name! Though aged be his visage, do not disdain! His locks, true, are white, but he was born to fight!
   1128268|00000000||The brave knight Ravix hails from Fourhorn! It might sound fictitious, yet there he was born!
   1128530|00000000||Ravix of Fourhorn! This year's champion! A sight to behold! He defeated Gregoire de Gorgon!
   1133956|00000000||Hail Ravix! Avix! Avix! Avix!
   1128532|00000000||Geralt of Rivia! This year's champion! A sight to behold! He defeated Gregoire de Gorgon!

   1128571|00000000||As patron of this grand tourney, I've the honor to decorate our grand champion.
   1206959|00000000||His vow he made upon the garter of Her Illustrious Highness Anna Henrietta. Doubtless the duchess' grace carried him to this splendid victory.
   1206961|00000000||His vow he made upon the heron. Doubtless the gravity of his knightly pledge upon the noble fowl carried him to this splendid victory.
   1206963|00000000||He made no vow yet throughout the tourney demonstrated knightly virtue that doubtless carried him to this splendid victory.
   1206954|00000000||His vow he made upon his love for his heart's captor. And it was doubtless this vow that carried him to this splendid victory.
   1206957|00000000||He showed great courage, great strength, great composure. He fought nobly, with honor, and thus rightfully deserves the title of this year's champion of the arena!
   1206951|00000000||I need to talk to you.
   1206953|00000000||Not now! We shall meet later in my tent. I've duties to attend to. As do you. Folk regard you! The least you should do is wave.
   1171097|00000000||Pacing the grounds the titans locked stares, ferocious and spry as wolves hunting hares.
   1171105|00000000||Mesdames et messieurs! Our victor, our champion! The unequaled and silent Gregoire de Gorgon! Hip, hip, hurray! Urray! Urray! Urray!
   1171109|00000000||The crowd cries in shock! Sir Geralt seems weak! Will he survive? His fortunes look bleak!
   1171107|00000000||The crowd cries in shock! Sir Ravix seems weak! Will he survive? His fortunes look bleak!
   1171111|00000000||The grim giant Gregoire - never defeated. Yet what see we now? Could his strength be depleted?
   1205450|00000000||Shall we see upon this day, a giant not of iron but of clay?
   1201969|00000000||I should take this opportunity to remind all that today's tourney is brought to you by the Vermentino and Coronata vineyards! Remember, whether it's dessert or dinner, serve Vermentino and you're a winner.

   1181156|00000000||The duquessa's dead… I can't believe it.
   1181154|00000000||I've sharpened the swords, groomed the horse, oiled the armor…
   1181152|00000000||I've still to scrub the horseshoes, then drop the war hammer at the smith's and the caparison at the dyer's…
   1181160|00000000||Forgive me.
   1181158|00000000||Mhm?
   1188937|074b1a13||Mermaid
   1211165|00000000||I cannot let them see me, recognize the vampire in me. Apologies Geralt, you must manage alone. I'm certain you will.
   1175140|00000000||This is no time for idle chatter. We must find Dettlaff.
   1175138|00000000||Even if he's not here, surely he's left behind some clue as to his whereabouts.
   1157694|00000000||Attic. Let's go.
   1198639|00000000||Old toy. No use to anyone. Shame, must've brought someone joy, sometime.
   1198641|00000000||Hm. Sombody fixed this recently.
   1198643|00000000||No dust mark. Somebody moved this here recently.
   1205569|00000000||Nice little trinket.
   1205571|00000000||Sometimes I think I might end up like one of these toys…
   1157734|00000000||I find these puppets rather disturbing…
   1157736|00000000||Nice tune.
   1157738|00000000||Indeed. I'm not certain why, but it reminds me of home. Our true home, from before the Conjunction of Spheres.
   1157730|00000000||So this is his nest. Need to look around.
   1184783|00000000||This his lover?
   1184785|00000000||I don't rightly know.
   1161983|00000000||Reminds me of someone…
   1161985|00000000||Who?
   1161987|00000000||Not sure. Can't help feeling I've seen that face before, though.
   1161981|00000000||That Rhenawedd?
   1157742|00000000||I don't know. As I said, I never met her.
   1157740|00000000||Woman's likeness… Bit smudged.
   1173115|00000000||Won't budge. Gotta break it down.
   1173117|00000000||You might just as well stand out in the street, pound on a drum and holler, "Dettlaff, I'm coming for you!" A bit more finesse, I implore you.
   1173119|00000000||Let's hear your idea.
   1173121|00000000||Give me a moment.
   1173124|00000000||Nice. Ever consider becoming a burglar? Skill like that'd come in awful handy.
   1173126|00000000||I considered it briefly, but ultimately concluded it would be terribly dull.
   1184779|00000000||Come.
   1187347|00000000||He here? Sense him?
   1187350|00000000||*Sniff* No. He's not here. But he was here recently, his scent is still strong.
   1187352|00000000||Let's look around.
   1198682|00000000||Tools were used recently. Dettlaff unwind by fixing toys between murders?
   1198684|00000000||Really, now, Geralt, must you?
   1198687|00000000||Where've you gone? Geralt, we've not finished yet. Argh, I expect you to return.
   1173281|00000000||Need something, my good man?
   1173279|00000000||Oh, sir! It's you!
   1173283|00000000||Not even a prayer can save your derriere when your blade's dull!
   1173285|00000000||I once knew a man who skimped on his blade. Gods grant him eternal rest in peace.
   1150750|00000000||Come on. Show me your claws.
   1171834|00000000||It was a warm summer evening... or perhaps a cool yet sunny morning? The weather and time are of no import, what matters is that day Geralt received a letter full of kind words from his beloved Triss, who informed him about a most unusual discovery she had recently made. In some old manuscripts she'd found mention of research conducted by a Professor Moreau on witcher mutations. It seemed this professor's workshop could be found in Toussaint. Geralt, realizing the importance of this discovery, decided to find this laboratory. The first step would be to find the professor's journal which, according to Triss, had been buried with him.<br>
   1171835|00000000||It was a warm summer evening... or perhaps a cool yet sunny morning? The weather and time are of no import, what matters is that day Geralt received a letter from Yennefer, who informed him about a most unusually discovery she had recently made. She'd found mention of research conducted by a Professor Moreau on witcher mutations. It seemed this professor's workshop could be found in Toussaint. Geralt, realizing the importance of this discovery, decided to find this laboratory. The first step would be to find the professor's journal which, according to Yen, had been buried with him.<br>
   1171836|00000000||Geralt soon discovered not only he wished to find Professor Moreau's laboratory. When the witcher reached the cemetery, he found the professor's grave had been dug up and the journal was nowhere to be found. The only clue he did find was an inscription on a grave mentioning the legendary Dol Naev'de, the Valley of the nine, which had been flooded years before by the Sansretour River. Seeing no other way to find the professor's lab, Geralt decided to search for more information in those sunken ruins.<br>
   1189439|00000000||His path was riddled with traps and other such obstacles, but our brave hero had much experience in running even more difficult gauntlets. Tired in both mind and spirit from his efforts, in the end he made it to the professor's lab.<br>
   1189440|00000000||Searching Professor Moreau's lab gave Geralt a somewhat expanded view of the professor's past and his research. It seemed Moreau's goal had not been to discover how to strengthen the witcher mutations, but just the opposite, how to reverse them, so he could "cure" his son Jerome of being a witcher.<br><br>To Geralt's delight, the professor's plan failed to achieve its desired result. This failure could be of use to the witcher, however, for by mixing the professor's secret formula into his bloodstream he gained access to a whole range of new mutations. These promised to make him stronger, faster, more resilient -- in short, better. Geralt looked forward to putting them to the test in combat.
   1206618|00000000||As unlikely as it sounds, Geralt found the entrance to Professor Moreau's laboratory in the sunken elven ruins of Dol Naev'de. Things seemed to be getting more and more interesting, so the witcher did not hesitate to plunge onward…

Interestingly, Geralt had already happened on another wretch much like this one. As it was, both had been sent to a certain death by one Bella de Gunness! The thought that I myself could have fallen into this black widow's intricately spun web… it gives me goose bumps of the most chilling kind.<br>The unfortunate soul would do no more diving. Geralt decided to look for the chest full of valuables himself.<br>
   1165137|00000000||The youth had been sent to the river to fish out a treasure from a boat that had gone to the bottom years before. The unfortunate soul would do no more diving. Geralt decided to look for the chest full of valuables himself.<br>
   1165138|00000000||The boat wreck was swarming with drowners. Yet the witcher cut them down to the last in a flash. He then found the treasure and, wealthier by a tidy sum, set off for his next adventure!<br>
   1165139|00000000||Read the letter.
   1165140|00000000||Find the casket within the sunken wreck.
   1165135|00000000||The Black Widow
   1151846|00000000||Ard Feainn! Just what we needed… a witcher with stones of granite!
   1175240|00000000||That… bloede hanse had terrorized this land too long. Thank you for your aid, vatt'ghern.
   1151855|00000000||Show me what you're peddling, Nilfgaardian.
   1151850|00000000||Show me your wares.
   1151857|00000000||So long.
   1151851|00000000||Farewell.
   1151849|00000000||Nilfgaardian innkeeper? Strange find.
   1151853|00000000||A Nilfgaardian a long way from home… and he's not a soldier. Don't see that often.
   1175242|00000000||Warfare did not appeal to me. My vathair, however - meaning, my father…
   1175244|00000000||He fought at Sodden Hill. Survived despite a lung run through with a spear and a right hand that went missing.
   1175246|00000000||Yet the injuries meant he could no longer serve in the Impera Brigade. Here in Toussaint, the clime and wine bolster healing. And a war pension paid in Nilfgaardian florens buys much… An inn, for instance.
   1175248|00000000||I thank you, witcher, for your aid, for recovering my patrimony. Ard dank!
   1151848|00000000||Witcher! Greetings!
   1195192|00000000||Witcher! Witcher! A word, might I have?
   1205977|00000000||Perusing a notice board in Toussaint, Geralt found the appeal of a ducal clerk. The clerk was seeking all manner of vagabonds, knights errant and mercenaries. The posting did not seem to be an offer of witcher's work, even so Geralt decided to learn more about this mystery job.<br>
   1210087|00000000||The clerk needed assistance. He was to find a new owner and steward for the Belgaard Vineyard, which at the time remained the property of the duchy. The owners of two other vineyards were competing for control of Belgaard. They were Matilda Vermentino and Liam de Coronata.<br>
   1205979|00000000||Go to the place where the auction will be held.
   1205976|00000000||Wine Wars: Belgaard
   1187568|00000000||So I was walking through Tufo - you know, that bum sniffer's vineyard. And fatigue overwhelmed me, so I lay down for a nap in a haystack.
   1193660|00000000||Then, out of the blue, the stack, the field, it all started shaking! Dancing about! As if a hundred demons were marching underground.
   1193662|00000000||Suuuure… You were a few bottles in, your head started spinning.
   1193664|00000000||It was as real as you or I, I tell you! I swear it on Lebioda's lap! On the Good Tome!
   1153818|00000000||Oi… pumpkin… stop by my bunk tonight? You could rub my under-tummy, least until the clock strikes twelve…
   1163521|ca56cad3||Pixie
   1186643|00000000||Odor's dispersed, seems to be everywhere. Basilisk must be high in the sky.
   1197260|00000000||Simply refrain from provoking her! Harm her not, and she, too, will leave you untouched.
   1180087|00000000||I've long suspected they do it on purpose - scent their goods. They seek to lure the basilisk to destroy their wares. It allows them to demand compensation from their assurers.
   1180095|00000000||Busted barrels slimed with venom. Hallmarks of an attack. Basilisk must've caught the second victim here.
   1180099|00000000||Anyway, got two scents - venom and tannin. Oughta be enough to track the beast.
   1197292|00000000||Why track her at all? Iocaste is protected! Her death would forever destabilize the ecosystem. Who knows what would happen. I see unforeseeable consequences down the line.
   1180083|00000000||Busted barrels, content spilled all over. Must've been tannin in there, used to treat leather.
   1180085|00000000||Beast smashed the barrels. That's how the scent go on the scale.
   1183401|00000000||Iococo is so very curious. Strong scents, especially, intrigue her. The barrels - they must have drawn her in, drawn her to the caravan.
   1180103|00000000||Hear something, but it's no basilisk's screech. Human voices?
   1186645|00000000||Scent's perceptible again.
   1175320|00000000||Bloodstains. Clear as day.
   1180101|00000000||Just as I expected. Second victim… but relatively unscathed. Basilisk must've been dragging him back to its nest for later. Dropped him for some reason.
   1183447|00000000||Wonder why.
   1186560|00000000||Scale. Color's unusual. Silver? Never seen one like this.
   1180079|00000000||Basilisk scales're usually thicker, not nearly so fine. Could be more sensitive to fire, this one.
   1180081|00000000||Alas, it is true. Iocaste has a terrible fear of fire. She's a highly sensitive creature. Rid your mind of any thought to kill her - you would destroy the last of a species!
   1180089|00000000||Strange, these burn marks. Beast's venom make them? Subspecies must be highly toxic.
   1180091|00000000||It is so indeed. A wound from a sterling basilisk festers long.
   1180093|00000000||Need to brew a potion that'll neutralize that.
   1183399|00000000||Scale's scent is intense. Is that *sniff*… tannin?
   1178162|00000000||Mhm?
   1178160|00000000||Whatsit?
   1178166|00000000||Yaaaaawn…
   1178164|00000000||Ahh.
   1187619|00000000||Unexpected as ever.
   1192015|00000000||And beautiful as ever.
   1192017|00000000||Won't you even ask why I've come? Or how I found you?
   1192019|00000000||Wouldn't get a straight answer anyway.
   1192021|00000000||Quite true.
   1192023|00000000||Used to bother me, all your secrets… Now I know if you have something to tell me, you'll tell me. Don't need to ask.
   1192045|00000000||I missed you, Geralt. Madly.
   1192047|00000000||Come outside. We can hold hands and stare at the sky. Like in some shitty two-crown romance.
   1192115|00000000||Liking Toussaint so far?
   1192117|00000000||Hmm… The landscape's lovely and the towns are charming, no question about that…
   1192119|00000000||But…
   1192121|00000000||But the southern sun plays havoc with my wardrobe. To be blunt, wear black down here and you're pretty damn hot.
   1192123|00000000||Hmm… Might need to think about changing your color palette. Off white and pea-green, for instance?
   1192125|00000000||Mhm. And I'll wear scents distilled from turnips and daisies.
   1192127|00000000||I think I shall simply stay in the shade. And you'll bring me cool drinks. At regular intervals.
   1192129|00000000||Bring you whatever you want.
   1192049|00000000||Toussaint - like it?
   1192327|00000000||You know, feels kinda strange having a home.
   1192329|00000000||Mhm. I must say I never pictured you owning real estate.
   1192354|00000000||Was something of an accident… but I'm not about to complain.
   1192357|00000000||Yen… Back then, before we fought the Hunt… Said you wanted to run away with me, to the world's end. This vineyard… good enough?
   1192359|00000000||Hmm… Yes, although… there's one thing missing…
   1192361|00000000||Namely?
   1192363|00000000||I shall give you a hint. It's large, white… has four legs… Category - taxidermy.
   1192365|00000000||Oh yeah. The unicorn.
   1192367|00000000||Fine. You can bring it down here.
   1192369|00000000||I knew you'd see things my way.
   1192050|00000000||Having a house… feels… strange.
   1192396|00000000||Every thought this day would come? Me and you… Peace and quiet… bees buzzing, birds chirping…?
   1192398|00000000||I almost regret delaying so long before coming to you… I was quite the silly goose…
   1192400|00000000||You have doubts? Though I imagine it might've been hard, coming after me. Always were proud as a peacock.
   1192402|00000000||Please, Geralt. I'm not like other sorceresses to feel that following someone means my wings have been clipped.
   1192404|00000000||Ooh, watch what you say about your colleagues - remember, it's an ill bird that fouls its own nest.
   1192406|00000000||Well said, witcher. You're not only handsome, but wise, too… I feel a bit like the cat that got the canary.
   1192408|00000000||Yeah, and I'm… Hmm. Dammit. You win. This time.
   1192410|00000000||Hah!
   1192413|00000000||How'd that start, anyway? Our duels in wordplay?
   1192415|00000000||Forgotten? It was at a vernissage in Ban Ard. You started it to keep from going mad with boredom. I remember finding your sense of humor both groan-worthy… and somehow endearing.
   1192418|00000000||Never change, Geralt. I beg you.
   1192394|00000000||We made it. Found our happy ending. Who would've thunk?
   1192323|00000000||So… talk again later?
   1192325|00000000||Of course. I'm not going anywhere.
   1192051|00000000||Let's talk later.
   1192048|00000000||Brought a lot of books.
   1192110|00000000||Brought quite a few books… Lemme guess - working on a new spell?
   1192112|00000000||Not at all. These aren't grimoires, just pleasure reading . "The Name of the Orchid," "A Widower for Half a Year."
   1192157|00000000||Hmm. Always thought you too busy to make time for something as impractical as pleasure reading.
   1192159|00000000||Because I was. But now, I'm not.
   1192162|00000000||A few weeks ago I awoke to the realization that I know not what to do next. I have no plan, I have no goal.
   1192164|00000000||And you know what? I like that. Finally I can stop thinking about politics and focus on what's important to me.
   1192166|00000000||Which is why I came here.
   1192053|00000000||Can we talk?
   1192055|00000000||Always. With pleasure.
   1148067|34d1701f||Lucien
   1165572|00000000||When it comes to a lass, candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker! Heheh.
   1165570|00000000||If you've one jug of wine and one friend, drink the jug of wine and send the friend for another… Thus spake the Prophet Lebidoda.
   1165576|00000000||Take me home with you!
   1165574|00000000||I'm drunk and lonely!
   1114556|00000000||Griffin must've gotten to him. Horrible way to die. Though, his paintings'll probably start selling like hot mince pies, now.
   1199054|00000000||Good man, I need a fresh set of shoes for my mount. Promptly!
   1199056|00000000||At your service, sir. The racing model is one I recommend - light, durable and a mere fifty crowns apiece.
   1199058|00000000||I shall pay you double provided they are ready today.
   1199098|00000000||I could use one like you! To bring water from the well, to show off about town…
   1200059|00000000||Fried toad's eggs! Dragon's eyes on a stick! Come and get it! Fresh and wholesome!
   1200356|00000000||Geeralt! Geeralt! Geeralt!
   1198981|00000000||Fried endrega glands! Dog's nipples! Get them while their hot! Spiraled pig's ears! Wren's tongues! On sale now! Come and get them!
   1200558|00000000||A knight's body… Guillaume. Poor fool.
   1199094|00000000||Brave knights - what are they good for? They nail no barrels together, they sew no stockings… Parasites, leeches, that's what they are.
   1205088|00000000||Lost blood, lots of it. Wrung dry, you might say. Numerous wounds… must've fought a tough battle before he died.
   1199090|00000000||Hey! He fought in the tourney! He looked taller in the arena…
   1199092|00000000||I was there. Papa took me. I saw him fight the other knights! What a sight, what a bumbotching! Ooh!
   1199078|00000000||Ahh, the flower of chivalry… Strapping lads!
   1200358|00000000||Raavix! Raavix! Raavix!
   1199088|00000000||That gray-domed scoundrel - ever seeking Lady Vivienne. Some kind of maniac.
   1199096|00000000||Long live the champion!
   1199060|00000000||The archery - that's what I like. Maybe this year they'll pop off another onlooker?
   1199100|00000000||Troooy! Redaniaaa!
   1199102|00000000||Yap less, fight more, bumbotcher.
   1214803|24c09a0e||Dettlaff
   1193491|00000000||I'm bored!
   1193493|00000000||Hahahaha!
   1193495|00000000||Nice!
   1193497|00000000||Stole my brother's sling. Will you go rat hunting with me?!
   1193499|00000000||That hurt!
   1193501|00000000||Aaaaa!
   1193503|00000000||Help!
   1188641|00000000||Dark secrets taint even a fairytale duchy like Toussaint.
   1188639|00000000||Appearances deceive, witcher. Beware.
   1188645|00000000||Keep your eyes peeled, witcher.
   1188643|00000000||Do take care, witcher.
   1202374|00000000||Not likely to learn anything more here.
   1202372|00000000||Need to ask around. Locals might know something more.
   1145745|00000000||Any finds? Dried blood, knives flecked with flesh?
   1145747|00000000||We need more action, excitement, a twist. The pacing's all wrong.
   1147946|00000000||Pay me no heed. Pretend I'm not here.
   1191328|00000000||Shhhhh!
   1191334|00000000||Yeah!
   1191338|00000000||Oh no, not again…
   1191340|00000000||Heeey!
   1191330|00000000||Mum! Where are you?
   1191332|00000000||Saw a dead man yesterday! Smelled funny and had no eyes!
   1191336|00000000||Wanna go to the port? Maybe there's some new ships!
   1191342|00000000||Don't step on me!
   1191345|00000000||Help!
   1191347|00000000||I want my mummy!
   1191814|00000000||Oh, Geralt! I knew you'd save us!
   1188930|00000000||Bagatelle - where is she? She's not in her stall, not in the corral…
   1195358|00000000||His Lordship rode her into the ground. Fox hunting.
   1195360|00000000||But… I told him she had just foaled, that he must treat her delicately…
   1195362|00000000||You're a simple peasant - what can you possibly know?
   1207610|00000000||Gods, lend us verve!
   1190180|00000000||Gods, lend us verve!
   1198308|00000000||The hanses banished, the bandits disbanded! Long live Sir Geralt!
   1190186|00000000||I vow to fight the hanses to the death! Mine, or theirs!
   1198314|00000000||Her Enlightened Highness is dead… yet it is not fitting to wallow in mourning.
   1190188|00000000||I swear on my honor! I shall smash the plunderers, scatter them to the winds and drive them from our duchy!
   1190184|00000000||Yes, sir?
   1190182|00000000||Sir?
   1190196|00000000||Honor! The duquessa! Toussaint!
   1207604|00000000||Honor! The duquessa! Toussaint!
   1190190|00000000||You little imp…
   1190192|00000000||Don't move! I'll slit open your bowels…
   1207608|00000000||You little imp…
   1207602|00000000||Now for a lesson in manners…
   1207606|00000000||Don't move! I shall slit open your bowels…
   1190194|00000000||Now for a lesson in manners…
   1198310|00000000||I salute you, sir! And once more thank you for the rescue!
   1198312|00000000||I shall be your debtor to my dying day! I thank you for the rescue, sir!
   1190198|00000000||I appeal to you for peace.
   1190202|00000000||No carousing, sir.
   1207600|00000000||Courage!
   1190200|00000000||Courage!
   1184919|00000000||One little, two little, three little elfies…
   1184921|00000000||Mama called the medic, and the medic said - no more elfies jumping on the bed!
   1177600|00000000||Greetings, greetings…
   1177602|00000000||What might I pour for you?
   1198280|00000000||Dammit, what will become of us…? The duquessa, dead…
   1177606|00000000||I'll soon have to tap another barrel at this rate…
   1177604|00000000||Leaping Lebioda's heels! I failed to order more lamb and red…
   1177608|00000000||Bumbersnatch!
   1177610|00000000||Would you raise a ruck here? In my establishment?
   1202143|00000000||Hey…
   1202145|00000000||Oi…
   1202149|00000000||Swine!
   1202151|00000000||Fuck 'em! Hard!
   1202147|00000000||Minges!
   1208521|73976745||Still Waters
   1190064|002e456e||Brigitte
   1185225|00000000||Ooh la la!
   1198535|00000000||Rumor has it the emperor will turn the duchy over to its folk. After all, the duchess, her sister - all the ruling family are dead.
   1198537|00000000||That young countess, Isabella Marie de Cygne - they say she drags maids down to the old amphitheater to summon ghosts! By stripping them naked and pouring wine on their nips!
   1198533|00000000||They say that to touch such swords as a witcher wears on his back is to lose one's virility! And not even Reginald's jewels can help.
   1198539|00000000||Well! You don't say…
   1198541|00000000||Oh, fumbledungs… Is that true?
   1185233|00000000||I liked you from the start! Every witcher I've known has been a swell lad!
   1185229|00000000||Here is the hero we can afford! Witcher, open the unbelievers' eyes!
   1185231|00000000||Now I shall sing you a song!
   1198543|00000000||One, two, one, two, three! Five, six, seven, eight!
   1185227|00000000||What have we here?! The tourney's champion!
   1185239|00000000||Crying crayfish! Is that ever a cloudy frown!
   1185235|00000000||Greetings! And welcome!
   1185237|00000000||Why… it's… Help!
   1122296|00000000||One day, Geralt happened upon an unusual contract notice. Someone was seeking the aid not of some unnamed witcher, but specifically of the witcher named Geralt of Rivia. The notice listed no other details, so Geralt, admittedly intrigued, resolved to see what was it issue.<br>
   1155594|00000000||The individual so intent on employing the White Wolf and no other was a certain Count Beledal, a nobleman from Kovir. The aristocrat wished to embark on a nature trek with the legendary witcher, and my dearest friend, as his guide. As the count was offering an exceptionally generous fee, and the job seemed simple enough in its nature, Geralt did not take long to accept the job.<br>
   1155595|00000000||The excursion with the Koviri noble proved rather refreshing, though not nearly as safe and certainly not as boring as Geralt had initially assumed it would be. During its course, the witcher was forced to fight giant centipedes, to tame a number of panthers, and to attempt to control a flock of peacocks. In a word, he had a grand old time, while at the excursion's end his coin pouch grew markedly heavier.<br>Pleased with the excursion and with Geralt for proving a consummate professional, Count Beledal invited the witcher to attend a picnic he was to host the very next day.<br>
   1155596|00000000||To refuse the invitation of a luminary such as Count Beledal would have been tactless. Thus Geralt appeared at the nobleman's temporary residence at the appointed time. There he had an opportunity to view the paintings his host had produced based on the illusions he had captured during their excursions using the parestisomach. Grateful for the excellent job the witcher had done as his guide, the count decided to additionally reward him, granting Geralt one of his works.<br>

   1181017|00000000||Come to visit your grandpa's grave, I guess?
   1181331|00000000||What the poking devils? Who're you? Who sent you?
   1181333|00000000||So many questions, so few answers.

   1181337|00000000||Ehh, if I only had a crown for every time a bunch like this…
   1129303|00000000||Hit him harder!
   1207705|00000000||They're… they're horrors!
   1207707|00000000||Let me alone, beast!
   1207709|00000000||Stay away! Not a step closer!
   1205526|00000000||Passing by Castel Ravello, Geralt came upon a vintner in desperate need of help. The kind of help only a professional monster slayer could provide…<br>
   1205527|00000000||A professional of the highest order, the witcher quickly cleared Chuchote Cave of the dangerous arachnomorphs that had infested it.<br>
   1205528|00000000||Contented, the vintner immediately began to turn the cave into a wine store, though not before he had suitably compensated the professional who had helped him.!<br>
   1205529|00000000||Clear the cave of monsters.

   1153569|00000000||Joss can usually be found wandering the glade at the foot of the mount. It's some distance from here, past the witch's house, to the right.
   1151579|00000000||What… what the hell was that?
   1151607|00000000||The Wicked Witch. You've heard of her, haven't you? Now where did she put that key…?
   1153252|00000000||Listen, I… How'd you come by a weapon?
   1201561|00000000||It's Prince Charming's. He no longer needs it.
   1153256|00000000||Here it is!
   1153287|00000000||Akh akh akh… Thank you. She'd have baked me for certain if you'd not… Syanna? Is that you?!
   1153289|00000000||It's been years, Jack.
   1153292|00000000||H-have you come to play?
   1153307|00000000||No, I just want your beans. So you can breathe easy.
   1153317|00000000||Beans? What beans?
   1153319|00000000||Ahem. Try not to interrupt. Well, Jack, where are they?
   1153311|00000000||Beans? What beans?
   1153310|00000000||Breathe easy…? What's that about?
   1153313|00000000||Breathe easy… because you aren't here to play? What's that about?
   1153315|00000000||Jack knows what I mean. So he'll tell me where the beans are as fast as he can, isn't that right?
   1173615|00000000||Syanna, I… I'm sorry, but… but I haven't got them!
   1173628|00000000||Oh, something tells me you're lying. Perhaps you wish to play the old games after all, hm? "This little piggy went to market, this little piggy went home," for instance?
   1173630|00000000||I'm telling the truth! I swear it! Anarietta… She ordered them buried all over so you wouldn't be able to leave!
   1173640|00000000||Where?
   1173642|00000000||I… I don't know! But… Joss, the boy with the thing for wolves, he should know! He sticks his nose in everyone's affairs!
   1173644|00000000||He had better know! Because if not, I'll find you and we'll have ourselves a little talk, understand? Now shoo!
   1173646|00000000||Agh, all right… So why is it you're here?
   1153383|00000000||Searching for my lost childhood. Wound up at Kaer Morhen as a little boy, don't quite remember how. Never had any toys, never played any games…
   1153386|00000000||What do you think? Why might I be here?
   1153366|00000000||Came to look for my lost childhood.
   1153364|00000000||Came to free you.
   1153369|00000000||Came to free you.
   1153371|00000000||Nice of you, but a waste of your effort. I plan to free myself.
   1153373|00000000||You might, you might not. Bound to be easier with my help - as our most recent adventure amply showed.
   1153395|00000000||Mhm. Yet I still don't know why you even give a damn.
   1153397|00000000||It's Dettlaff. He's trying to force Anna Henrietta's hand. Wants her to release you. Summoned monsters to attack Beauclair.
   1166559|00000000||Sounds like Dettlaff, all right… But I doubt you came all this way just to bring me up to speed on current events. So get to the point, please.
   1153442|00000000||Isn't it obvious? Offering to be your ally. We both want you out of here. You, because you want your freedom back. Me, because as soon as you meet with Dettlaff, he'll put an end to the chaos in the city.
   1153445|00000000||You exposed me. I landed in prison because of you. Now you come to beg my help, I daresay? My, life is full of surprises, isn't it?
   1166562|00000000||Normally, I'd tell you to sod off. But… from what you say, folk are dying who have nothing to do with this. Not part of the plan. Dettlaff was only to kill those who deserved it. No one else.
   1173690|00000000||Fine, witcher… I accept your offer. Consider us allies. Shake on it.
   1173711|00000000||Those Dettlaff killed, what'd they do to you?
   1173714|00000000||Since you brought it up… The knights Dettlaff killed - what exactly did they do to you? Crespi, du Lac, la Croix, Peyrac-Peyran?
   1173718|00000000||Not a memory I enjoy revisiting, but… I suppose you deserve to know.
   1173735|00000000||When my parents disowned me, they ordered those very knights to escort me beyond the duchy's borders. All did so without uttering a single word in my defense.
   1173737|00000000||Like you said, they had their orders…
   1173739|00000000||Mhm. But Crespi was not ordered to beat me unconscious with a horsewhip after my first attempt at escape. And du Lac had no instructions to deny me food and abuse me.
   1173758|00000000||I learned something then - knights are not so chivalrous when no one's watching.
   1173773|00000000||Sorry, but… that's no excuse.
   1173775|00000000||I didn't tell you so you would pardon me. I was only hoping you would understand.
   1173760|00000000||No excuse for what you did.
   1173759|00000000||Explains a lot.
   1173778|00000000||That… explains a lot.
   1173780|00000000||Shocked, aren't you. You must have thought you had me pegged. Before bothering to hear my side. Everyone does that.
   1151582|00000000||This place, tell me about it.
   1153547|00000000||This place… Tell me something more. It's an illusion, right?
   1153549|00000000||Yes. Created by Artorius Vigo. Anna Henrietta and I would come here to play out scenes from our favorite fables.
   1153551|00000000||Witch didn't seem like she was playing.
   1153553|00000000||Magical entropy. Without maintenance, the spell gradually disintegrates over time. It grows wild.
   1153555|00000000||Your sister chose a dangerous place for your prison…
   1175263|00000000||It's deceptive. Provided I don't provoke them, the fairytale characters don't attack me. But you… you don't belong here. So you had best be on your watch.
   1153439|00000000||They exiled you because of the Curse of the Black Sun, right?
   1151613|00000000||Curse of the Black Sun - that's why you were banished, right?
   1153538|00000000||Mhm. Twisted princesses, mutants. I'm certain you've heard of us.
   1153540|00000000||Even met one of you. Renfri of Creyden.
   1153542|00000000||And? Was she truly monstrous?
   1153545|00000000||She was cruel, that's certain. But what caused it - the curse or what she went through… Asking myself to this day.
   1153562|00000000||You killed her, didn't you.
   1153564|00000000||Had no choice.
   1153566|00000000||Funny. Mum said the same when she tossed me out of the house.
   1151581|00000000||So, what's with these beans?
   1151609|00000000||So… what's with the beans? Mind explaining?
   1153513|00000000||Hm. Certainly. But you must gird yourself with patience.
   1153515|00000000||There are two ways out of this land. My darling sister blocked one when she tossed me in here. The other's up there… in the clouds. She made it hard but not impossible to access by concealing the beans.
   1153518|00000000||Still don't understand…
   1153520|00000000||Don't fret, just listen. That boy… that was Jack. Of beanstalk fame. You know the tale?
   1153522|00000000||Jack… climbed a gigantic beanstalk to a giant's castle, high up in the clouds…
   1153524|00000000||As we shall do if we can just find those blasted beans… There are three - one red, one blue, one yellow.
   1173679|00000000||Huh… Stalk won't sprout from just one?
   1166159|00000000||No, because it must transpire exactly as it did in the tale. Clear now? So, we must find Joss. Perhaps he will be able to help us. You lead.
   1198784|00000000||I've heard that, too!
   1198782|00000000||Beh, the worst sort of danglestones!
   1188797|00000000||Duchess Anna Henrietta's soul find rest…
   1188799|00000000||Oh, you gave those bumdiddlers a good reason to diddle their bums! You freed us of the hanses! I thank you!
   1200636|00000000||Master Liam and Maid Matilda - I've a feeling they're the apples of each other's eyes.
   1198913|00000000||Those Coronata folk are worse than… than the clap, cholera, plague and leprosy! Combined!
   1188795|00000000||Wine is better than stew, for stew you have to chew.
   1188793|00000000||My stomach growls like an angry wolf.
   1198788|00000000||An old friend saved the witcher from the noose. Some Julian fellow, who once courted the duchess herself!
   1198790|00000000||They hammer away again at the quarry! The witcher from the North's lifted the curse! The lads can go back to their labors.
   1198786|00000000||The innkeep's boy got so soused the other day, he tried to stick an egg back up a hen's hiney!
   1188803|00000000||Ohh, life.
   1188801|00000000||Tarry in good health.
   1086260|00000000||Blacksmith
   1199338|00000000||He's late…
   1199340|00000000||Relax. He'll come.
   1199342|00000000||There's something I'd like to know… How can you be so damned calm?
   1199344|00000000||Side effect of my mutations - we witchers rarely get the jitters.
   1199346|00000000||What if something has happened to him…?
   1199348|00000000||Captain seems like a man who can take care of himself.
   1199350|00000000||Perhaps he can, but this Cintrian appears to be no common bandit…
   1199352|00000000||He managed to steal ducal wine from under my guardsmen's noses. We only learned of it through a fortunate coincidence.
   1199354|00000000||And it was he who specified the victims for the vampire. One must be exceptionally confident to blackmail such a monster.
   1199356|00000000||He slipped up, and we'll use that.
   1199362|00000000||Sooner or later, everyone slips up. Cintrian stole the Sangreal - that was his mistake.
   1199364|00000000||Yet if we had not happened on the wine stain…
   1199366|00000000||You're right, we got lucky. Even so, still can't be sure he's behind the kidnapping, the blackmail.
   1199250|00000000||What'd you learn - tell us.
   1199256|00000000||Don't care. Down to business - you learn anything?
   1199258|00000000||I will start at the beginning…
   1199278|00000000||Gotta nab the Cintrian. Seems we have to go to that get-together…
   1199280|00000000||You read my mind, witcher. I shall gather my men, surround the establishment. Not a mouse will squeeze through.
   1199282|00000000||Out of the question! If the Cintrian truly does have men about the city, he will find out and escape once again.
   1199284|00000000||Duchess is right. Need to be careful. Best go there, blend in with the crowd.
   1199286|00000000||Precisely what we shall do.
   1199288|00000000||We, Your Grace?
   1199290|00000000||Geralt and I. In that sort of company, the witcher could use my help.
   1199292|00000000||Where's the event gonna be held?
   1199294|00000000||The Mandragora always assembles at the same place - a residence in Hauteville. It's a very distinguished district.
   1199296|00000000||Geralt, you must don appropriate attire. Then meet me in Hauteville, in Mountebank Alley.
   1199181|00000000||Need to nab the Cintrian.
   1199182|00000000||The Mandragora - what's that?
   1199184|00000000||The Mandragora - what's that?
   1199186|00000000||A club, an affiliation of local artists. Painters, sculptors, troubadours, and dancers.
   1199188|00000000||Never heard of it.
   1199191|00000000||They exude a mystique - consciously, I think - behaving like an exclusive cabal, artistic elites. Every now and again they mount soirées. Only wealthy patrons are invited.
   1199193|00000000||All arrive in elaborate masks, then drink and flirt.
   1199260|00000000||The port warehouse where the wine was delivered - we identified it, then learned who had hired it out. This proved to be a beggar, a stand-in.
   1199262|00000000||We found him, he admitted all. A man had paid him to sign the lease, a man he met while begging outside the Pheasantry.
   1199264|00000000||There, fate lent us a hand. A waitress recalled spilling wine on a nobleman who spoke with a Cintrian accent…
   1199266|00000000||What'd he look like?
   1199268|00000000||Her description was not helpful - handsome, well-dressed, with a beard, no distinguishing marks. This could be anyone. But she remembered his female companion very well, as she recognized her.
   1199270|00000000||On the Cintrian's arm was Cecilia Bellante.
   1199272|00000000||The singer? I've heard of her. She is said to be gifted, very.
   1199274|00000000||The same. We went to her home immediately. Cecilia was not there, but we questioned her servants.
   1199276|00000000||A chambermaid claimed Cecilia is to meet a Cintrian gentleman tonight. She'd invited him to a reception mounted by The Mandragora.
   1199252|00000000||Used to it. Not the first time I've been hunted.
   1199254|00000000||Must you always…? Now…
   1199249|00000000||Not the first time.
   1199368|00000000||Need to find the Cintrian - whether or not he's responsible for the murders.
   1199370|00000000||Even if none of it's his doing, he could still know our blackmailer's identity.
   1199372|00000000||Besides, it's one thing to know who ordered the killings. Other thing entirely, and just as important, is why they…
   1199374|00000000||Someone's coming.
   1199377|00000000||Captain, why so long? We expected you hours ago.
   1199379|00000000||This Cintrian does not work alone. We are fighting an organization, not one man.
   1199381|00000000||Bandits attacked us, not a small force, either. One of my boys has a broken arm, another, a shattered knee… lamed for life.
   1199383|00000000||And the word on the street is there's a hefty bounty on your head, Geralt…
   1199358|00000000||Still don't know this Cintrian's behind the kidnapping and blackmail. Might've just handled the theft of the wine.
   1199360|00000000||Even if it's so, he then sold the wine to the blackmailers. As I see it, that makes him an accomplice.
   1199355|00000000||Cintrian could actually be a middleman.
   1199385|00000000||Here at last…! We lack only Damien, now… I'm worried something might have happened to him…
   1199335|00000000||Her Grace awaits inside.
   1191820|00000000||You stuck your neck out for us, for the common folk… Thank you, witcher!

   1186748|00000000||Yes?
   1186746|00000000||Things are good.
   1186750|00000000||Oh, bury me beneath the willow, under the weeping willow tree. So she will know where I am sleeping, and, perhaps, she'll weep for me…
   1186752|00000000||My heart's about to burst from a surfeit of beauty!
   1201452|00000000||Let us drown our sorrows in White Wolf!

   1155817|00000000||So nice to see you again! What do you need?
   1155815|00000000||Welcome to my humble establishment! What land do you hail from?
   1184565|00000000||Ehh… Been on the road so long, don't know how to answer that. Let's just say I'm from the North.
   1184567|00000000||Aaah… Is it true what they say? About the war, death, destruction all about…?
   1184569|00000000||Exaggerated. Not by much, though.
   1184571|00000000||Ah, forgive my asking, but I've family in Aedirn, see. So I'm curious… But please do tell me what I can do for you.
   1155818|00000000||Mind showing me what you have on offer?
   1155822|00000000||Show me what you're selling?
   1184583|00000000||Friend, let's say.
   1184581|00000000||Of someone very dear to me.
   1184585|00000000||Ahem. At any rate, pretty town, Vengerberg. Also didn't suffer too much during the invasion, from what I know.
   1184587|00000000||Phew, that is a relief to hear! A weight off my shoulders, I tell you!
   1188490|00000000||You play much gwent? Up for a quick match. maybe?
   1181904|00000000||Round of gwent, what would you say?
   1155828|00000000||Should be going. Farewell.
   1155820|00000000||Farewell.
   1155819|00000000||Got family in Aedirn, huh?
   1155824|00000000||Mentioned you have family in Aedirn…? Whereabout? If you don't mind my asking.
   1155826|00000000||In Vengerberg. You've been there, perhaps?
   1184579|00000000||Uh, yeah. Number of times. It's the hometown of my… Hm.
   1205717|00000000||While roaming the slopes of Mount Gorgon, Geralt ran into a vintner who required a witcher's aid.<br>
   1205718|00000000||Our hero plunged into the depths of the cave, which proved to be a shaelmaar's lair. Geralt slew the beast, a feat for which a reward awaited.<br>
   1205719|00000000||Pleased, the vintner was generous, and our hard-working witcher, richer by a few crowns, went on his way.<br>
   1205715|00000000||Clear the cave of monsters.
   1205716|00000000||Return to the contract giver.
   1205714|00000000||Vintner's Contract: Duchaton Crest
   1194851|00000000||Fare thee well.
   1194853|00000000||Arrogant bastard!
   1194855|00000000||The impertinence!
   1194857|00000000||Auuuu!
   1161222|00000000||Go to the Unseen Elder's lair.
   1161228|00000000||Enter the Unseen Elder's lair.
   1161230|00000000||Defeat the vampires.
   1161231|00000000||Get out of the cave.
   1167522|00000000||Talk to the Unseen Elder.
   1174252|00000000||Open the entrance to the Unseen Elder's lair using Orianna's key.
   1176641|00000000||Meet Regis at the docks.
   1194318|00000000||Jump into the water.
   1184789|00000000||Reach the platform and get out of the cave.
   1210301|00000000||[Optional] Collect the items and gear you lost as you fell.
   1189937|00000000||Geralt now knew how to find the Unseen Elder's lair. He went to fetch Regis, and together they set off to meet the ancient bloodsucker. I can only imagine how difficult a Regis' predicament was. After all, he was about to help his dear friend set a deadly trap for another of his close comrades…<br>
   1189938|00000000||The Unseen's ghastly reputation proved entirely deserved. He had exactly no tolerance for unexpected guests. And he was mortal danger embodied. In the end Geralt managed to convince the creature to help him, but persuading the beast had almost cost the witcher his life. I have no doubt the witcher breathed a sigh of relief after their meeting, and drew comfort from the thought it would not be the Unseen he would face during the final confrontation at Tesham Mutna.<br>
   1210265|00000000||Regis had expressed some concerns about meeting with the Unseen Elder. These proved not at all unfounded nor in any way exaggerated. To say the ancient vampire treated his guests impolitely would be a gross understatement. In a matter of moments, the Unseen paralyzed Regis, while he took Geralt and, much as if he were a rag doll, hurled him to the floor of the cave. The witcher was hurt rather badly. Yet somehow he needed to find an understanding with the vampire…<br>

   1177732|00000000||I'm ears alone, witcher.
   1177730|00000000||Yes?
   1177736|00000000||Toussaint's best wines would be impossible without passion.
   1177734|00000000||Wine, like all things noble, requires patience.
   1163619|00000000||Impressive. You'd think you were in a winter garden.
   1164361|00000000||Cradle filled with children's shoes. Doubt I've ever seen a collection this grotesque.
   1186339|00000000||Something on the other side… Can't hope to get through. Neither sword nor Signs will cut this.
   1182632|00000000||Bones… human. Hollow inside. Marrow's been sucked out.
   1182636|00000000||Rusty armor - all that remains of the last thrill-seeker to make it out here.
   1165285|00000000||Dammit! Knight got ambushed.
   1168386|00000000||Ugh. Very well. To work, then. Gods, thy will be done!
   1163625|00000000||Clear as day, now. Spriggan, gotta be. Seems to be off somewhere, probably feeding. Need to lure it.
   1163629|00000000||Dead. Branches crushed his bones and internal organs. No sign of the monster. Hid, maybe?
   1163723|00000000||Perhaps we should turn back? If there's no beast, there's no beast. Damn shame, but we tried…
   1168376|00000000||Not so fast. Let's take a look around.
   1163615|00000000||Hm. Strange. No sign of Grottore.
   1163633|00000000||Decided to say hello, have you.
   1163623|00000000||Various sundries, some tools… Grottore must've taken them from its victims.
   1168384|00000000||They speak the truth about the villages. Grottore consumes babes.
   1163621|00000000||Bones… Small skull, fontanel's not completely closed. An infant, about a year, maybe.
   1163631|00000000||Burning bright and warm.
   1211063|00000000||Better see what happened to the knight.
   1152162|00000000||My eyes were not deceived! Yet - so far south?! You, sir, of all folk, in all your fame.
   1152165|00000000||Mhm. Me… south, in all my fame.
   1152169|00000000||Ach! I've heard so much! Why, when Master Dandelion tarried in Beauclair, not a day passed without him baying out a ballad in admiration of your deeds.
   1152172|00000000||Ahem… Yeah, unwelcome little habit of his. But… what can I do for you?
   1152174|00000000||Ahh. You see, my betrothed, François le Goff, vowed, in my honor, to bring me the head of the horrid beast they call Grottore!
   1152206|00000000||Mgh. Couldn't 'ave gotten you a bouquet… some sweets in a bag?
   1152208|00000000||Witcher, sir, you jest! A love most true demands proof through heroic deeds dedicated to the heart's captor!
   1152215|00000000||But alas… François has been gone a fortnight. Thus I must plead with you to see what's become of him. Could you? Would you?
   1105841|00000000||Do my damndest to get your fiancé back safe and sound. Just, uh… mind telling me where to look for him?
   1105843|00000000||I forget you come from afar and do not know our land. They say Grottore has its lair in the caves at the foot of the Gorgon Hills.
   1179566|00000000||That close to the city? Telling me no bold souls've ventured out to defeat the beast?
   1179568|00000000||Quite the contrary, plenty have. But none's returned. My concern is well-founded!
   1105851|00000000||I see. All right… High time I set off.
   1105073|00000000||Sure, I'll look into it.
   1152243|00000000||This Grottore - know anything else about it, mademoiselle? Judging by the name, guessing it lives in a cave.
   1152245|00000000||Yes… From which it prowls when hungry. By night, when all are asleep, it creeps into villages. Then, of a sudden, breaks open shutters, reaches inside and snatches babes from their cradles so quickly they've not the time to yelp!
   1152247|00000000||Hmm… Nocturnal, long prehensile arms, intelligent…
   1152249|00000000||François claimed he would cut the filth down in a snap, but he's been gone so long… Will you help, sir? I cannot sleep, I fear this worrying will be the death of me…
   1152210|00000000||This Grottore - know anything about it?
   1105080|00000000||Not saying no… but I gotta think about it.
   1105074|00000000||Need to think about it.
   1168347|00000000||My reward - let's talk.
   1168349|00000000||Rarely my wont to turn down a damsel in distress… even less so when there's a, ahem, prize involved.
   1168351|00000000||Ah! Naturally! Why, you, sir, are no knight errant, but a guildsman, an expert. How much would you need?
   1168353|00000000||Master, forgive me, but you ask much too much!
   1168355|00000000||A few crowns less, master, a fistful. I beg you so.
   1168359|00000000||Master, take no offence, I beg you… but clearly I am in no position to meet your expectation. I offer what I can, yet if it is insufficient to your mind, a must ask another's help.
   1168357|00000000||Yes. That amount I am prepared to pay.
   1105070|00000000||Ah, master. Will… will you help?
