    354979|00000000||Hello, witcher. Good to see you, but if you come to ask 'bout new finery for the feast, I'm afraid there'll be trouble. I've only two doublets left.

   1077486|00000000||Me savior! Greetin's to ye! So, in for a shear?
    577784|00000000||Get a haircut from you?
   1066792|00000000||Looking for a barber? Well, you've found one. Welcome! I'll ploughing shave the gentleman's noggin for half price!
   1066795|00000000||This is not what I wanted.
   1066797|00000000||What do you mean, not what you wanted? Are you cut and coiffed? You are. And even as even can be, I'd say.
   1066805|00000000||Mhm. Thanks a bunch.
   1066799|00000000||Mhm. Thanks a lot.
   1066798|00000000||Wrong cut, wrong coif.
   1066801|00000000||This is not the look I wanted.
   1066803|00000000||And this is not the fate I wanted. I was to be an alderman in Mahakam. Instead, I shave and cut tramps and ragamuffins! Life deals what it deals, you shrug and you take it!
    577814|00000000||Gimme a haircut? Uh, long as your hands aren't too shaky…
   1066793|00000000||Ah, welcome back to you! Satisfied customer always comes by again, eh?
   1066788|00000000||All right. How bad can it be?
