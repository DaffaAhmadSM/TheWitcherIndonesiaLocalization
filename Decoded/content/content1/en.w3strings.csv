    590999|00000000||What exactly were they talking about?
    591007|00000000||I hear right? They mention the Lodge?
    591009|00000000||Yes, and later Philippa said something about vision regeneration…
    591011|00000000||Think she was able to get her eyesight back?
    591014|00000000||Think Philippa pulled it off? Restored her eyesight?
    591016|00000000||It would be reckless, but not impossible. They seemed to say she was planning to implant tissue grown on precious stones.
    591018|00000000||Till now only Vilgefortz has ever managed. If she succeeded… well, I suppose congratulations would be in order.
    591012|00000000||Why would they talk about the Lodge?
    591019|00000000||Margarita mentioned Ida and Francesca, then Keira and Fringilla…
    591028|00000000||I've little doubt Philippa means to revive the Lodge of Sorceresses.
    591033|00000000||They weren't sure about Triss, excluded you right away…
    591035|00000000||I'd never agree to rejoin. Philippa believes only the Lodge can look after mages' interests effectively. I disagree and prefer to act alone.
    591036|00000000||Besides, the moment's inopportune. Reviving the Lodge would enrage both Radovid and the emperor. They're at a critical stage of their duel for influence, and neither would welcome a new player.
    591010|00000000||Wondering what to do with the crystal.
    591045|00000000||Fine, keep the crystal.
    591048|00000000||Yen, I've decided. I'll give the crystal to Radovid.
    591050|00000000||You're making an error. But it is your decision.
    591046|00000000||I'll give the crystal to Radovid.
    563765|00000000||I accepted a job, plan to finish it as best I can. Crystal needs to go to Radovid.
    563767|00000000||Very, very bad idea. You could harm not only Philippa, but Triss, me…
    563761|00000000||Gotta take it to Radovid.
    563759|00000000||Yeah, you keep it.
    563763|00000000||Right. It'll be safer with you.
    591001|00000000||Hm… Wonder what I should do with the crystal…
    591003|00000000||It cannot fall into Radovid's hands, not under any circumstances. You'd better leave it with me.
    590998|00000000||Wondering what to do with the crystal.
    563787|00000000||Dammit! That's it - I can't recover any more.
    519868|00000000||"The Northern Wars: Myths, Lies and Distortions." Historical treatise by Restif de Montholon.
    519879|00000000||Missing some pages.
    572808|00000000||Witcher George. High time we painted over that.
    572811|00000000||Mounted witchering just never took off.
    572812|00000000||Long, lonely winters breed some pretty strange ideas.
    332443|002e3ae9||Book
   1031476|00000000||Slow down! Rogues!
   1012975|00000000||No reaction from the Council, the Conclave?
   1012976|00000000||Do you jest? They asked Radovid to "intervene." Just after he'd appointed them.
   1012978|00000000||Later I learned priests of the Eternal Fire stood amidst the academy's ruins, promising the rabble that such a punishment awaited all mages and traitors.
   1012973|00000000||If you're here, what's become of Aretuza?
   1012974|00000000||The day I arrived in Novigrad, I received a message from Biruta Icarti. A short, curt note - "School overrun by Redanians. The libraries burn. Handful of pupils fled with Nina Vivero, the rest are dead. It is over."
   1012963|00000000||Aretuza, the school - what happened to it?
   1012980|00000000||Farewell, Rita.
   1012964|00000000||Farewell.
   1012962|00000000||How'd the witch hunters nab you?
   1012965|00000000||Thought Margarita Laux-Antille'd be among the last to get nabbed by witch hunters.
   1012966|00000000||Were it dependent solely on me, of course I would have. But you forget I had my students to consider.
   1012967|00000000||I knew the hunters would eventually reach Aretuza - it was but a matter of time. So when I heard Triss was organizing escapes to Kovir, I saw no reason to hesitate.
   1012968|00000000||I gathered my novices and we rode here to Novigrad. Sadly, we were caught and thrown in Deireadh before I could contact Triss.
   1012969|00000000||Didn't see any other sorceresses in there with you…
   1012970|00000000||Because they'd already been executed. Burned… alive… one after the other. The most talented girls in the North. Radovid was saving me for last.
   1012958|00000000||How're you feeling?
   1012959|00000000||Better, I thank you. If you'd not arrived in time, things might have ended considerably worse. I am your debtor.
   1028937|00000000||Thank Yennefer. It was her idea, her plan.
   1012961|00000000||Geralt. What can I do for you?
   1031674|00000000||Was chasing something when it fell. Probably sensed things could end badly, but the bloodlust was just too strong.
    385297|00000000||Triss' earring?
    444237|00000000||Good thing I found it…
    408102|00000000||Get it back to Triss.
    385301|00000000||[Take it.]
    408100|00000000||Might as well leave it. Triss must've thrown the other one away by now.
    385303|00000000||[Leave it.]

    577727|00000000||Been drinking again? Moving like a fly in tar.
    577729|00000000||Call that a strong blow?
    577731|00000000||Strong enough to break your guard.
    577733|00000000||Think I'm training Ciri tomorrow. She's likely to be more of a challenge.
    575089|00000000||Hear the old man fell asleep while teaching.
    575093|00000000||Maybe a storm's comin'.
    470780|00000000||You survive by stealing from others. This can't end well. You should ask someone for help.
    470787|00000000||Who'd help us? Who'd take us?
    544169|00000000||Once we've got all the hens, we'll go deep in the woods!
    470791|00000000||Petey says we's gonna hunt, wear animal hides, sew a tent outta leaves…
    544171|00000000||And never grow up!
    544173|00000000||Hmm. Last bit's most likely.
    544175|00000000||Good luck, I guess. And watch out for yourselves.
    470768|00000000||You should look for help.
    470739|00000000||Gotta go.
    470763|00000000||Time I was on my way.
    471842|00000000||You'll not tell anyone we's here?
    471844|00000000||I won't, but you be careful.
    470778|00000000||Time for me to go.
    470766|00000000||Where'd the wolf prints come from?
    470770|00000000||Where'd the wolf prints come from?
    470772|00000000||Da once hunted down a wolf, gave each of us a paw for good luck. We tied 'em to our shoes.
    470774|00000000||Cause wolves steal hens, right?
    470776|00000000||Sure, usually not one at a time, though.
    470747|00000000||Why're you in the woods? Where are your parents?
    470753|00000000||Soldiers caught 'em.
    470755|00000000||We was crossin' the river, but they spotted us. We ran, but mum and dad had bags. Told us to flee.
    470759|00000000||Lived in the woods alone ever since?
    470761|00000000||Sure. Find a lot of things, steal a few others… we get by just fine.
    470737|00000000||Why are you kids here?
    470733|00000000||Not gonna hurt you.
    471039|00000000||Then why're you here? That captain with the black mustache send you?
    470735|00000000||Don't know any captain. Followed the tracks of the hen-stealing monsters here.
    471041|00000000||Pff, you're a lot of fuss over a few skinny hens.
    470741|00000000||The old lady didn't like 'em much anyway. She were always yellin' at 'em. And she looks like a witch.
    470717|00000000||Watch out, Petey! He's got a sword!
    471021|00000000||A soldier!
    470719|00000000||He won't take us alive!
   1074151|00000000||Hm… Wonder if parrots do all right in mountain air.
    563535|5a32e0f6||Mercenary
   1027682|00000000||Good day, Gray One.
    579355|00000000||Ah. Finally here. Rules are simple. Choose who you're gonna run against, make your wager, then ride to Blackbough and back. First's the winner, second's a bleedin' cunt. Got it?
   1027684|00000000||So who you gonna race? Stutterin' M-m-matko? Iron-Arse Hans? Or Black Bogdan?
    579374|00000000||Iron-Arse Hans.
    579383|00000000||Let's see how that iron arse holds up. C'mon, Hans.
    579381|00000000||Spent half my life on horseback. Other half on the backs of ponies. You can't beat me.
    579384|00000000||Ride against Black Bogdan this time.
    579386|00000000||Take you for a ride, all right.
   1027686|00000000||C'mon, let's set the wager… and get racin'.
    579378|00000000||Y-y-y-y-you'll s-s-s-see I-i-i-i-i'll b-b-b-b-b-b-b… ehhh, fuck it.
    579376|00000000||I'll take Stuttering Matt.
    579373|00000000||Stuttering Matko.
    579364|00000000||Changed my mind, don't really wanna race. Have fun without me, gents.
   1021674|00000000||Changed my mind. Not gonna race.
    579375|00000000||Black Bogdan.
    470650|00000000||May they rot in shallow graves, the whoresons! They've nicked another!
   1073063|00000000||Thank ye, witcher! Ye ought to come by Mulbrydale, see me forge. I'll have somethin' for ye. A gesture of gratitude.
    574625|00000000||Sebaiknya tidak.
    574640|00000000||Sebaiknya tidak. Vesemir bilang kalau sampai itu terulang, dia akan membuatmu memakan semangkuk siput. Dilumuri garam.
    574641|00000000||Hahaha. Eeewwwww!
    576732|00000000||Tepat sekali. Jadi jaga kelakuanmu.
    576738|00000000||Tentu. Ini sekolah witcher atau pemandian elf?
   1058679|00000000||Tentu saja. [MULAI TUTORIAL]
   1058680|00000000||Tidak kali ini. [LEWATI TUTORIAL]
   1058682|00000000||Jangan sekarang. Percayalah, kau tak ingin membuat Vesemir menunggu.
    574642|00000000||Ayo. Kita akan berlatih dengan yang lain di halaman bawah.
    576736|00000000||Haruskah kita balapan?
    574633|00000000||Maaf saja tidak cukup.
    574635|00000000||Kau akan membaca "Ghouls and Alghouls" secara keseluruhan. Termasuk bagian lampiran.
    574637|00000000||Tidak, kumohon… Aku lebih memilih membersihkan kandang kuda!
    574639|00000000||Diskusi selesai.
    574619|00000000||Permintaan maaf saja tidak cukup.
    574605|00000000||Kau punya PR. Refleksmu masih lamban.
    574607|00000000||Mungkin untuk seorang witcher.
    574609|00000000||Pikirmu drowner atau striga akan baik padamu karena kau belum bermutasi?
    574610|00000000||Meski begitu kalau di posisimu aku akan lebih takut Vesemir daripada striga. Tak mematuhi perintahnya… Tidak bijaksana.
    574614|00000000||Tetapi… buku itu sangat membosankan!
    574616|00000000||Kau tahu itu bukan alasan.
    574618|00000000||Ugh. Maaf. Tak akan kuulangi.
    546852|00000000||Salah.
    546854|00000000||Sekarang aku mengerti kenapa kau begitu bersemgangat untuk berlatih. Serang!
    576696|00000000||Ha!
    576698|00000000||Kau tidak sedang dalam sirkus. Berputar-putar!
    546856|00000000||Salah. Gerakan kaki!
    576700|00000000||Cukup. Turun.
    546858|00000000||Dengan salto?
    546860|00000000||Menurutmu?
    576702|00000000||Lepas penutup matamu.
    312802|05e75e62||Harpy
    432580|00000000||Now - parrying. Ciri, see how Geralt holds his sword? Its angle?
    432582|00000000||Dodge!
    577761|00000000||Strong strikes, now. Give it all you got!
    577759|00000000||Quick cuts. One, two, three!
    546723|00000000||What the blazes are you doing?
    546725|00000000||Tomfoolery! Enough!
    546721|00000000||Stop showing off, Geralt.
    577969|00000000||Riposte. Strike, counter-strike!
   1057722|00000000||Fine, enough. Continue training at will!
   1058454|00000000||Hunuskan pedangmu, Geralt.
   1058458|00000000||Now, young lady, to bring the day to a close, we'll go over a few witcher's Signs. Let's start with Quen.
   1058460|00000000||Cast Igni, Geralt. I wanna see sparks fly!
   1058462|00000000||Aard, Geralt! Come on!
   1070598|00000000||Slow as a fly trapped in amber today… Do it again.
   1071561|00000000||Good!
   1071477|00000000||Yrden, now. Show her, Geralt.
   1071479|00000000||Time for Axii. Dammit, I hate this feeling…
   1071481|00000000||Throw a bomb. Don't worry, Ciri, Quen'll dampen the blow.
   1075088|00000000||Ugh… Axii can really muddle your mind.
   1075066|00000000||See this, Ciri? Couldn't move if I wanted to.
   1075064|00000000||Ciri, Quen is sometimes called the "witcher's shield." Now watch carefully to see why.
   1075062|00000000||See? If not for the Quen Sign, I'd be aflame by now.
   1075060|00000000||See that, Ciri? Aard will knock anyone or anything off balance, destroy their rhythm.
    467274|40b3f5c5||Refugee
    574124|00000000||Kita sudah memanjakannya.
    574263|00000000||Harus mengakui kita sudah memanjakannya.
    574265|00000000||"Kita" sudah memanjakannya? Aku sudah mengatakannya dari awal - Ciri butuh orang yang tegas.
    574267|00000000||Sudah mengatakannya, benar. Tetapi kau membiarkannya seperti yang kami lakukan.
   1044455|00000000||Hm. Baiklah, Kupikir aku juga pantas disalahkan. Tetapi ini harus berakhir. Sekarang.
   1048566|00000000||Membunuh monster bukanlah hal yang bisa dianggap remeh. Ciri harus mengerti itu kalau menjadi salah satu dari kita.
    574270|00000000||Sampai ketemu di halaman bawah.
    574257|00000000||Jangan marah padanya.
    574259|00000000||Kenapa tidak? Dia enggan melakukan apa yang diperintahkan.
    574261|00000000||Itu yang kau suka dari dia.
    574117|00000000||Jangan marah padanya.
    578211|00000000||Witcher tua tertidur nyenyak… Ciri menghilang entah ke mana, tentu saja.
    573920|00000000||Kupikir dia lebih suka praktik daripada teori…
    574106|00000000||Hm? Apa?
    573954|00000000||Waktunya bangun, master.
    573935|00000000||Pelajaran-pelajarannya sangat membosankan hingga membuatmu tertidur juga?
    573936|00000000||Menyuruhnya mencatat tentang "Ghouls and Alghouls"… Ingin mengistirahatkan mataku sejenak.
    574098|00000000||Huh. Membuatnya bekerja keras dengan buku-buku itu? Gak heran dia pergi.
    574100|00000000||John of Brugge kurang berbakat, benar, tetapi dia bisa dipercaya. Tidak seperti omong kosong yang mereka tulis saat ini.
    574126|00000000||Dia berlatih dengan pendulum, 'kan?
    574102|00000000||Berapa kali aku harus memberi tahunya? Jangan berlatih seorang diri, itu hanya menyematkan kesalahan-kesalahanmu.
    574104|00000000||Bawa gadis muda kita ke halaman bawah. Dia ingin berlatih? Dia akan mendapatkannya.
    478419|00000000||Where's you goin'? That's a place o' culture, not a trough for swine to trudge to…
    478437|00000000||Door on the left.
   1064835|00000000||This where Madame Irina's troupe performs?
    492248|00000000||Yeah. But you can only enter with a ticket. There's no performance now, mummers're just rehearsin'. Process is interestin' to observe, though.
   1040331|00000000||So. Want a ticket?
   1040310|00000000||No performance, said so yourself.
   1040312|00000000||You can still get a ticket. What'll it be?
    478435|00000000||Yeah, one.
    478436|00000000||Here. Just stay outta sight, eh? Awful bashful, these mummers in rehearsal.
    478430|00000000||Yeah, I'll take one.
    478432|00000000||No. No need.
    478433|00000000||So be it. But you'll not get in. Whores through a window - them you can watch gratis. These here're artistes.
    478431|00000000||No. Don't want a ticket.
    480265|00000000||Need a ticket?
    540303|00000000||Have a look, perhaps even procure?
    540302|00000000||Humblest greetings, sir! Care to peruse!
    541747|00000000||Greetings.
    540321|00000000||Salutations. Wither do you come from, and where will you go?
    541748|00000000||Hard to say. Seen a lot of the world and plan to see more.
    540322|00000000||As have I, as do I.
    540386|00000000||Take a peek, if you don't mind.
    540296|00000000||What're you offering?
    540393|00000000||Nice area. Business booming, I guess?
    540394|00000000||Travelers stream north, many refugees among them. They lack for near everything, so I make ends meet.
    540395|00000000||Any dealings with soldiers?
    540396|00000000||A bit of trade, a bit of bribery, extortion, too, at times. But all in all, I finish ahead.
    540298|00000000||Business booming?
    540397|00000000||So close to Novigrad… Wouldn't you rather trade inside the city walls?
    540398|00000000||The guilds entrenched there… why, their members fix prices to stifle any competition.
    546757|00000000||I do a robust trade here, with none to pester me, no walls to ring me in. The open's a pleasure in itself, I'm certain you agree.
    540299|00000000||Wouldn't you rather trade in the city?
    540385|00000000||Farewell.
    546750|00000000||We'll meet again, I know this.
    540300|00000000||Farewell.
    540297|00000000||Dangerous place, this.
    540387|00000000||Not the best place for a traveling peddler.
    540388|00000000||Profits lie amidst risk. True, the war's brought strife and hardship - but folk live on. And where there is life, there is trade.
    540389|00000000||Prepared to risk your life for a bit of coin?
    540390|00000000||Coin, my friend, is of little import. Hard as I try, I simply cannot remain still. So I wander, and wander, the world.
    546754|00000000||I see new places, speak with folk I've never known. It's what I like, and that's worth the risk.
    540384|00000000||Hahah. Mountains don't move and thus never meet, but men…

    578399|00000000||Isn't there something you ought to be doing?
    578620|00000000||Not now. Ciri awaits.
   1071630|00000000||Kau benar. Aku harus menemui Ciri.
   1071640|00000000||Ahh, yeah. Sebaiknya aku menemui Ciri.
   1071629|00000000||Mari sedikit nakal.
   1071632|00000000||Mari sedikit nakal.
   1071634|00000000||Aha! Jadi begitulah angin bertiup…
   1071642|00000000||Pergi dan berlatihlah dengannya. Lalu kembali. Itu akan memberiku waktu untuk berdandan.
   1071644|00000000||Dari semua wanita yang kukenal, hanya kau satu-satunya yang melakukan itu…
   1071646|00000000||Kau kenal banyak wanita?
   1071648|00000000||Apa itu penting? Hanya kau seorang yang kupikirkan…
   1071636|00000000||Aku sangat merindukanmu.
   1071638|00000000||Aku juga. Tetapi kita akan punya banyak waktu untuk itu.
   1071628|00000000||Ingin bersamamu sedikit lebih lama.
   1071433|00000000||Dengar, kurasa Ciri bisa menunggu sedikit lebih lama.
   1071435|00000000||Itu gak baik. Keterlaluan.

    591090|00000000||Tengkorak burung… dalam kristal hitam. Mengapa kupikir ini milik Yen?
    577144|00000000||Kau tau itu gak lucu.
    577145|00000000||Itu memang bukan lelucon, tetapi untuk membuatmu bergegas. Ini sudah tengah hari.
   1059264|00000000||Pfff…
   1059266|00000000||Kau berjanji dengan Ciri akan berlatih dengannya.
    577169|00000000||Pergilah, sebelum Vesemir membuatnya bosan dengan buku-buku itu.
    577154|00000000||Jadi… sampai nanti?
    577155|00000000||Mmh. Sampai jumpa.

    515166|00000000||Oh, got a signal…
    515165|00000000||Nothing here…
    515167|00000000||Signal's growing stronger…
    515168|00000000||Can't be far now.
    515169|00000000||Ah, there you are…
   1065315|00000000||Aha… Getting warmer… warmer… Hot.
   1065341|00000000||Ugh… Damn cat. Ffwsshht!
   1056125|00000000||Shit. Lost the signal…

   1020642|00000000||Leo's grave… A senseless death, could've been avoided.
    573897|00000000||"Ghouls and Alghouls, or the Vile Denizens of the Necropolis," by John of Brugge. Intriguing title, boring as shit.
    573899|00000000||A drowner… with a mustache and glasses. Ciri at work.
    573901|00000000||Illustrated atlas of insectoids - from "arachas" to "Zerrikanian Xanthogramma."
    573903|00000000||Ciri's notes. Pretty… chaotic.
   1045978|00000000||Hmm… Some intense studying going on here.
    573895|00000000||"Brother Adalbert's Bestiary." A classic.
    590026|00000000||…Francesca's equally hesitant. Neither she nor Ida wishes to decide blindly.
    590027|00000000||They'll stop hesitating as soon as we convince Keira and Fringilla.
    590028|00000000||Fringilla's on our side. She'll join us as soon as she's finished some business in Nilfgaard.
    590029|00000000||Wonderful, that leaves Keira. The problem is, I've still no notion where she could be.
    590030|00000000||What about Yennefer and Triss?
    590031|00000000||Yennefer's never belonged to the Lodge, and Triss… Well, we shall see. I must regain my vision. I can go to Novigrad then to see Arthur de Vleester. The word is Triss is also carousing about the city.
    590032|00000000||You still insist? Phil, pardon my saying so, but you will never regenerate your eyes on your own.
    589901|00000000||Vilgefortz did it. I'm employing the same method - cultivating tissue on precious stones.
    589902|00000000||It's madness… …need… ...ower… ...ut your…. …reat dange…
   1075855|00000000||Hm. Impressive specimen.
   1028457|00000000||This the katakan you had a contract for?
   1028458|00000000||Mh. A month of tracking, stalking, but I finally dropped the son of a bitch.
   1028502|00000000||Congratulations. Can't help wondering, though - why'd you keep the corpse? Aim to stuff it, hang it above the mantle?
   1047877|00000000||Hm, not a bad idea. Gotta finish the autopsy first, though.
   1047879|00000000||This one was quicker than most. Quicker and stronger. Wanna examine it thoroughly.
   1047921|00000000||Open its gut.
   1047932|00000000||So? Anything interesting?
   1047934|00000000||Errr, bits of undigested food. A few decades worth, looks like. Human hair, a belt buckle, a few coppers… and a gold ring.
   1049082|00000000||Want to give it to Yennefer? Oughta be as good as new once you polish it a bit.
   1047936|00000000||No, thanks. She only wears silver.
   1047938|00000000||It's her loss. Rest is perfectly normal - except for its gnarled liver. Seems it had a penchant for the blood of drunkards.
   1047887|00000000||Open up its gut.
   1075859|00000000||Not sure I'd 'ave managed without the alchemist's help.
   1047950|00000000||So how'd you take it down?
   1047952|00000000||Heh, long story. Tell you another time.
   1047940|00000000||Nice claws. Fifteen inches, I'd say.
   1047942|00000000||They grow its whole life. This one was about a hundred, hundred ten years old.
   1047946|00000000||Pretty muscular legs. Calves and feet especially.
   1047948|00000000||Lemme tell you, this sucker was fast. One second here, there the next, always in the shadows. Could barely see it.
   1047888|00000000||Let's look at those claws.
   1047956|00000000||Think I've seen enough for now. This was an old one. Experienced.
   1047963|00000000||Hm. It'd be nice to figure out a way to determine a katakan's age based on its tracks. Avoid running across one like this unprepared.
   1047965|00000000||It would, I agree. But later.
   1075857|00000000||See you, Eskel.
   1047889|00000000||That's enough for now.
   1047886|00000000||Let's examine its head.
   1047913|00000000||Let's examine its head.
   1047915|00000000||Long whiskers… Protruding frontal lobe, but that's normal. Long ears… and an earring?
   1047917|00000000||Mhm. Seen that before. Some of them like shiny objects. Like magpies.
   1047919|00000000||And in the maw… yellowed, dulled teeth. Missing its upper front teeth, lower incisors…
   1047924|00000000||Clearly not a flosser. Fine, let's move on.
   1047900|00000000||Mind if I have a look?
   1047902|00000000||Wanna do the honors?
   1047904|00000000||No, thanks. You cut, I'll grab a bite to eat.
   1047880|00000000||Lemme have a look.
   1047894|00000000||Right, leave you to it, then.
   1047881|00000000||Leave you to it.
   1075861|00000000||Change your mind? I was just about to start.
   1028500|00000000||Hey there, Geralt.
   1028505|00000000||Mind if we talk later? Need to clean up before we train.
   1056879|00000000||Going to get Ciri?
   1047896|00000000||Mhm. Vesemir wants her to practice.
   1047898|00000000||I'll join you. Soon as I clear the table.
    470706|00000000||Wolf prints, and small footprints next to them. But no signs of struggle…
    470708|00000000||Now just little footprints. Not your typical werewolves - if that's what this is.
    470711|00000000||Little footprints… Interesting.
    470704|00000000||Wolf prints, all right. Though something's not right…
    470895|00000000||Me hens! Took 'em all, the little snots!
    470887|00000000||Do I throw 'em more seed, gran?
    470889|00000000||No, that's enough. And don't call me gran.
    470891|00000000||Aye, aye, I'll remember.
    472440|00000000||That there spotted hen - can that one be mine, gran?
    470893|00000000||Ugh. A-- Aye, child. She can.
   1058289|0a09c08e||Bilge Hag
   1047842|00000000||Love knows no bounds, I guess.
   1047848|00000000||Mhm. Love knows no bounds.
   1047850|00000000||Not so. Her parents told her that if they saw her with a Nilfgaardian, they would shave her head, cut out her tongue and banish her from their home.
   1047852|00000000||Listen, Lena… she has not fully recovered. I took her with me when I was transfered, thought she might get better. But no - she says nothing, recognizes no one, sleeps most of the day.
   1047854|00000000||I warned Tomira. Witcher potions have powerful, usually permanent side effects. Can't do anything to help now. Maybe a mage could.
   1047856|00000000||I don't know whether to thank you, or curse you for not letting her die with dignity.
   1047860|00000000||Trust me - choice I had to make was harder.
   1047844|00000000||Lousy spot for a romantic encounter. If the griffin hadn't gotten her, something else would've.
   1047846|00000000||I know… but I could only ever get away between watches. Those woods, they were close.
   1047839|00000000||Lousy spot for a rendez-vous.
   1047276|00000000||Hey, you! Halt!
   1047278|00000000||Geralt of Rivia, correct? You were in White Orchard recently? Near Vizima?
   1047284|00000000||Mhm. Charming village. If you don't mind rotting corpses.
   1047834|00000000||There'd have been one more if not for you. Lena… she survived, thanks to your potion.
   1047836|00000000||Nice to see a Nilfgaardian soldier so concerned about the fate of some simple Nordling. But kind of surprising, too.
   1047838|00000000||That night, when the griffin attacked her… she was on her way to meet me. In the woods near the garrison.
    563532|0030c07e||Hans of Cidaris
   1038368|00000000||Hm, Could chew through a mace with them choppers. Maybe even Nilfgaardian plate.
   1038370|00000000||If it's a basilisk… then where's it's deadly gaze?
   1038372|00000000||That cage not a bit small? Beast can't even turn around.
   1038366|00000000||Looks a bit like Corporal Heribert in the mug, eh?
   1032201|00000000||Good-for-nothin's! Done spooked me horse!
   1031788|00000000||Dammit!
    579319|00000000||All right, who else is racin'?
    579329|00000000||G-g-g-gee u-u-up!
    579331|00000000||Ou-ou-outta the w-w-way, m-m-maggots! M-m-matko's c-c-comin'!
    579339|00000000||Oi, witcher! Your mum not want you?
    579341|00000000||I'll be first, if I have to skewer my mare with my spurs!
    579313|00000000||I'm not much for talkin'. But put me on a horse… whoo, watch me run!
    579337|00000000||Yeeeeh-haaah!
    579335|00000000||Faster, Beecher, faster! Got a ripe apple for you when we're through!
    579311|00000000||C-c-c-c-came t-t-t-o r-r-r-race, not ch-ch-ch-atter.
    579323|00000000||Mount up!
    579317|00000000||Talk to Radko. He's the one sets the races.
    579326|00000000||Goooo!
   1084448|103d846e||Doe
   1075506|e3976585||Old Speartip
    577747|00000000||Never lock your elbow when striking, young lady!
    577739|00000000||Hahaha. And ooone!
    577741|00000000||Take that! Sliced your jugular!
    577749|00000000||Position, Ciri! Footwork! Remember!
    577743|00000000||What am I supposed to parry? I'm fighting a stupid dummy!
    577745|00000000||Pretend now, live later!
    574766|00000000||Apa yang kukatakan tentang pernapasan? Melalui mulutmu, seirama dengan langkah-langkahmu.
    577080|00000000||Huhhhh… Huhhhh… Huhhh…
    577082|00000000||Ciri. Hentikan itu.
    577084|00000000||Oh tidak… Raut muka Vesemir begitu.
    577086|00000000||Apa yang kau harapkan?
   1056855|00000000||Geralt, apa ini? Ayolah!
   1059615|00000000||Kau dalam masalah? Haruskah aku kembali dan membantumu?!
   1059617|00000000||Pertama! Hehe. Na-na-na-na-naaa!
   1059619|00000000||Aku menang.
   1059621|00000000||Kakimu lebih panjang! Akan kutunjukkan kepadamu - hanya perlu tumbuh sedikit!
   1059611|00000000||Hey! Kau bilang kita gak boleh melakukan itu!
   1059613|00000000||Aku bilang kau yang gak boleh melakukan itu.
    574750|00000000||Aku akan sampai duluan ke halaman bawah!
    577077|00000000||Hah. Mungkin kalau kau terjatuh.
   1028700|00000000||Jangan ganggu aku, Geralt! Aku akan tersandung dan jatuh!
    346241|fd7deb62||Adventurer
    576828|00000000||Kau bisa mengatakan sudah membacanya selagi Vesemir tertidur.
    576840|00000000||Jadi kau sudah membacanya. Kenapa gak langsung mengakuinya?
    576841|00000000||"Jangan pernah menerkam keuntungan begitu itu muncul. Tunggulah sampai efek maksimal." Kata-kata Paman Vesemir.
    576842|00000000||Kau belajar dengan cepat. Cepat, tetapi nakal.
   1058686|00000000||Mulai dari dasar-dasar. Bahkan master yang ahli pun perlu mengasah dasar-dasar… dan Ciri masih pemula.
   1058683|00000000||Mari mulai dari dasar-dasar. [MULAI TUTORIAL TEMPUR]
   1058684|00000000||Mari langsung ke latihan bebas. [LEWATI TUTORIAL]
   1058688|00000000||Mari kita langsung ke latihan bebas. Tidak ada gunanya kembali ke dasar-dasar.
    576835|00000000||Baiklah, cukup bicaranya. Geralt, kau denganku. Lambert dengan Eskel. Ciri dengan boneka kayu.
    576837|00000000||Huh… Lagi?
    576838|00000000||Berhenti mengeluh dan ambil pedangmu!
   1058717|00000000||Bagaimana menurutmu - haruskah kita mulai dengan meninjau dasar-dasar, atau langsung ke latihan bebas?
    576830|00000000||Jangan mencoba mengelak dari hal ini.
    577037|00000000||"Seorang witcher harus tahu cara mengelabui lawannya." Kau sendiri yang mengatakannya.
    577039|00000000||Benar. Tetapi jangan gunakan kata-kata bijakku pada Vesemir, mengerti? Itu berbahaya.
    576819|00000000||Jangan mencoba mengelak dari hal ini.
    573553|00000000||Ada yang ingin kau sampaikan sendiri, gadis muda?
    573554|00000000||Maafkan aku, Paman Vesemir.
   1044494|00000000||Jiwa anak muda sangat berapi-api, aku mengerti itu. Tetapi ketika melawan beast, pengetahuan sama pentingnya dengan silver sword-mu. Setidaknya, kau harus bisa membedakan ghoul dengan alghoul…
    573556|00000000||…"dari ciri-cirinya, seperti ciri pada panthera tigris yang mendiami Zerrikania, dan ciri pucat sakit pada muka."
    573557|00000000||Hmm. Jadi kau sudah membaca bagian itu. Tetap saja, kau seharusnya bertanya apakah…
    576818|00000000||Tetapi kau tertidur, Paman Vesemir.
   1050632|002efcee||Deer
    468514|00000000||This basilisk is interesting because it looks exactly like a wyvern. Young one, and ill-fed at that.
    468516|00000000||You talk nonsense, sir. This here's the most truest of basilisks!
    468518|00000000||Right, what do I know. I'm just a witcher.
    468520|00000000||Hold on, now! If that's no basilisk, but some weevern, what did I pay for? Give me back my coin, cheat!
    468525|00000000||Brave soldiers, don't push, or it'll-- Whoa, watch out!
    468508|00000000||That's a wyvern, not a basilisk.
    468534|00000000||Well, well… Spent years hunting monsters, and yet I'm still learning.
    468536|00000000||Look on, soldiers! Even a witcher scurries from the mighty basilisk. For all beasts fear it, even dragons… what'm I sayin', crocodiles! And crocodiles are inconceivably terrifyin', as anyone who's seen one will attest!
    468512|00000000||See ya.
    468510|00000000||Huh? From cockerel eggs?
    468528|00000000||Cockerel eggs, you say…
    468530|00000000||And what cocks they are! Lift their rumps like brood hens to other cocks! Eggs laid by such a cockerel must be brought to hatchin' by a hundred and one venomous vipers! Then the young basilisk pecks its way out…
    465682|00000000||Interesting basilisk you've got there.
    468182|00000000||Course it's interestin'! Won't see a beast like this anywhere near here! They spawn only in the wild wastes of Zerrikania - from eggs laid by cockerels!
    579262|00000000||Can we talk?
   1027615|00000000||Aye, long as it's short and to the point, 'cause I don't wag me tongue for jollies.
   1027617|00000000||They call me Radko. I arrange the horse races here. You must've heard talk. Wanna try? Say the word. Don't? Sod off.
    579272|00000000||Wanna sign up.
    579273|00000000||Don't need no signin'. Long as you're here come sunset. And bring gold for the bettin'.
    579270|00000000||Sign me up.
    579265|00000000||Maybe later.
    579271|00000000||Maybe later.
   1027621|00000000||So what'll it be? Gonna race or not?
    479120|00000000||What happened, ma'am?
    479122|00000000||As if the war weren't enough, sir. I'm losin' me hens! How'm I to live? Eh?
    479124|00000000||Get a look at the thieves?
    479126|00000000||What thieves?! It's monsters takin' me chickens.
    479128|00000000||An ordinary thief I'd nab on me own, but beasts? What'm I to do?
    479108|00000000||I can help you. Not for free… But, you're advanced in years, so I won't ask too much.
    479110|00000000||Poppycock. "Not much," he says, but you'll take me liver come the end. Well, no one else's linin' up to help me…
    479114|00000000||Me hens started disappearin' about a week past. Always take one at a time, the vermin.
    544130|00000000||One at a time? Interesting… Monsters leave any tracks?
    544132|00000000||Aye, prints of wolf paws, but… strange-like, as if the wolves walked on their hind legs.
    544134|00000000||And don't you be like that wise-arse Yosip from Downwarren. Tells me I'm mistaken. But few know beast tracks like I do - me man were the best poacher for miles around.
    544136|00000000||I see. I'd still like to examine the prints myself.
    479116|00000000||I can help you.
    479046|00000000||Keep watch - kids are likely to try again.
    479048|00000000||Oh, I'll be waitin' for 'em! With a stout branch to smack the little shits with!
    479052|00000000||Easy, they're just kids.
    479054|00000000||Aye, for now. But they'll grow into bandits, you wait!
    479057|00000000||Watch out… They'll be back.
    479028|00000000||Take them in, give 'em a home. Won't steal from you, then.
    479030|00000000||Sure, but I'll be feedin' the whelps! I gain nothin' from it.
    479032|00000000||But… Suppose I'll give it some thought.
    479058|00000000||Give 'em a home. Likely to stop stealing, then.
    479070|00000000||Found a group of kids in the woods. They were the ones stealing your hens.
    479072|00000000||Oh, children, eh? Ridin' on the backs of wolves, were they?
    479074|00000000||Never any wolves here. The kids are just… clever…
    479076|00000000||If they've anythin' in their noggins, they'll stay away from me hen house now!
    479170|00000000||I found the thieves.
    479173|00000000||Take care, now.
    479171|00000000||Farewell.
    479155|00000000||Eh, witcher? What is it?
   1064995|00000000||So many corpses… And the war's just started.
   1064997|00000000||Scar's healed nicely.
   1064993|00000000||Puncak gunung indah seperti biasanya.
    579470|00000000||Nice, nice. You seem to know horses as well as you do monsters. Here's your gold… And if the urge to race again grabs you, come see me.
    579472|00000000||Unearthly witcher senses - they prattle on about them. Yet you just got outrun by a common grunt. Lost your gold… but get some more, and I'll arrange a rematch.
   1032203|00000000||Felt like takin' a shortcut, clever boy? We don't tolerate none of that shite. You left the course, you lose your gold. Gotta win it back if you wanna see it again. You gotta race… honest this time.

   1058292|00000000||Geralt, berhenti memainkan perlengkapan mandiku.
   1056954|00000000||Kau kehabisan minuman jus.
   1058286|00000000||Kau mungkin mau membawakannya lagi setelah selesai berlatih.
   1056956|00000000||Punya pakaian lain selain warna hitam atau putih?
   1058288|00000000||Mhm. Pakaian dalam.
   1056944|00000000||Tak ada yang lain selain perak…
   1058285|00000000||Emas gak cocok dengan gayaku. Kau harusnya tahu itu.
   1031654|00000000||The old signal tower. It'll be nothing but a pile of rubble soon.

   1028793|00000000||Up for a few rounds of gwent?
   1086497|00000000||Gwent - would you play me?
    422120|00000000||So long.
    422116|00000000||Farewell.
    422114|00000000||Show me your wares.
    422118|00000000||What've you got there?
